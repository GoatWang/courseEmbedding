Phillips 66 Partners is a growth-oriented, master limited partnership formed by Phillips 66. The partnership was created to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined product and NGL pipelines, terminals, and other transportation and midstream assets.
Headquartered in Houston, Phillips 66 Partners completed its initial public offering in July 2013, and its common units trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PSXP. The partnership has executed more than $3 billion in acquisitions in the last three years.
Phillips 66 has majority ownership of Phillips 66 Partners and acts as the general partner with management and operating responsibility for the business. The remaining limited partner (LP) common units are held by the public.
The partnership’s assets consist of crude oil, refined products and NGL pipeline, storage and terminaling systems, and an NGL fractionator, which provide stable, fee-based revenues. Since the IPO and through the first quarter of 2016, Phillips 66 Partners has grown its distribution per LP unit by a 39 percent compound annual growth rate.
Phillips 66 Partners holds one-third ownership interests in the Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines, which connect NGL production from the Eagle Ford Shale Basin, Permian Basin and Midcontinent to Texas Gulf Coast markets. DCP Midstream operates the pipelines, which began service in 2013. PSXP now also owns Sweeny Fractionator One and the associated Clemens Storage Caverns.
The partnership continues to make progress on its organic growth projects. In April 2016, Bayou Bridge Pipeline, LLC, (a joint venture between Phillips 66 Partners, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) and Sunoco Logistics Partners (SXL)) began operations on the segment of its pipeline from Nederland, Texas to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Progress continues on the section from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana, with commercial operations for this segment expected to begin in the second half of 2017. This remaining section of the pipeline will be constructed by ETP. ETP and SXL each hold a 30 percent interest in the joint venture. On Dec. 1, 2015, Phillips 66 Partners acquired Phillips 66’s 40 percent equity interest in Bayou Bridge.
In December 2015 Phillips 66 Partners began operating the Palermo Rail Terminal, which provides railcar-loading from truck deliveries and is located on a 710-acre site near Palermo, North Dakota. Its current capacity of 100,000 BPD is expandable to 200,000 BPD. Phillips 66 Partners holds a 70 percent interest in the joint venture that owns the terminal.
By the end of 2016, the terminal is expected to connect to the Sacagawea Pipeline, currently under construction, which will further enhance logistical options for transporting crude from the Bakken region. Phillips 66 Partners will operate the Sacagawea Pipeline and owns 44 percent of this asset.

      Logistics Assets



Expected to be immediately accretive to unitholders


Assets support Phillips 66’s Bayway, Billings, Borger and Ponca
        City refineries


Phillips 66 to enter into long-term minimum volume commitments


 HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Phillips 66 Partners LP (NYSE: PSXP) (the “Partnership”) has reached
      agreement with Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) to acquire 30 crude, refined
      products and natural gas liquids (NGL) logistics assets for total
      consideration of $1.3 billion. The Partnership plans to fund the
      acquisition with a combination of debt and $196 million in new PSXP
      units issued to Phillips 66, to be allocated proportionally between
      common units and general partner units allowing the general partner to
      maintain its 2 percent general partner interest. The transaction is
      anticipated to close this month, subject to satisfaction of customary
      closing conditions, and is expected to be immediately accretive to
      unitholders. Upon closing, the Partnership will be entitled to receive
      the cash earnings associated with the acquired assets as of Oct. 1, 2016.
    

      The acquisition consideration reflects an approximate 8.7 times multiple
      based on the forecasted full year 2017 earnings before interest, taxes,
      depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) attributable to the assets of
      approximately $150 million. In connection with the acquisition, Phillips
      66 will enter into 10-year terminaling and throughput agreements that
      will include minimum volume commitments covering approximately 85
      percent of forecasted volumes.
    

      “As our largest dropdown acquisition to date, this represents a
      milestone for the Partnership and will provide additional fee-based
      income and diversity to our already strong midstream portfolio,” said
      Greg Garland, Phillips 66 Partners chairman and CEO. “We remain
      committed to maintaining a stable, fee-based, growing business model at
      Phillips 66 Partners, and are on track to deliver on our commitment to a
      five-year distribution compound annual growth rate of 30 percent through
      2018.”
    

      The transaction includes the following assets:
    


        A crude pipeline and terminal system that provides crude supply for
        Phillips 66’s Ponca City Refinery, consisting of 503 miles of pipeline
        and 1.7 million barrels of storage;
      

        A refined products and NGL pipeline and terminal system that provides
        product takeaway transportation services for Phillips 66’s Ponca City
        Refinery, consisting of 524 miles of pipeline and 1.7 million barrels
        of storage;
      

        A crude pipeline and terminal system that provides crude supply for
        Phillips 66’s Billings Refinery, consisting of a 79 percent undivided
        interest in a 623-mile pipeline and 570,000 barrels of storage;
      

        A refined products pipeline and terminal system that provides product
        takeaway transportation services for Phillips 66’s Billings Refinery,
        consisting of 342 miles of pipeline and 386,000 barrels of storage;
      

        A refined products and NGL terminal system that provides storage
        services for Phillips 66’s Bayway Refinery, consisting of 2.0 million
        barrels of storage;
      

        A crude pipeline and terminal system that provides crude supply for
        the Phillips 66-operated Borger Refinery, consisting of 1,089 miles of
        pipeline and 400,000 barrels of storage; and
      

        A refined products pipeline and terminal system that provides product
        takeaway transportation services for the Phillips 66-operated Borger
        Refinery, consisting of 93 miles of pipeline, a 33 percent undivided
        interest in a 102-mile segment and a 54 percent undivided interest in
        a 19-mile segment of a 121-mile pipeline, a 50 percent interest in a
        293-mile pipeline and 700,000 barrels of storage.
      


      A detailed listing of these assets including names and maps is available
      on the Phillips 66 Partners website.
    

      The terms of the transaction were approved by the board of directors of
      the general partner of Phillips 66 Partners, based on the approval and
      recommendation of its conflicts committee comprised solely of
      independent directors. The conflicts committee engaged Evercore to act
      as its financial advisor and Vinson & Elkins, L.L.P. to act as its legal
      counsel.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS


This press release contains forward-looking statements as defined
      under the federal securities laws, including projections, plans and
      objectives. Although Phillips 66 Partners believes that expectations
      reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no
      assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to be correct.
      In addition, these statements are subject to certain risks,
      uncertainties and other assumptions that are difficult to predict and
      may be beyond Phillips 66 Partners’ control. If one or more of these
      risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove
      incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what Phillips 66
      Partners anticipated, estimated, projected or expected. The key risk
      factors that may have a direct bearing on the forward-looking statements
      are the accuracy of our assumptions used to estimate the benefits to be
      realized from the acquisition, our ability to successfully complete the
      acquisition and integrate the assets into our operations, and other
      factors as described in the filings that Phillips 66 Partners makes with
      the Securities and Exchange Commission. In light of these risks,
      uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the
      forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different
      extent or at a different time than as described. All forward-looking
      statements in this release are made as of the date hereof and Phillips
      66 Partners undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any
      forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
      future events or otherwise.


Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information -- This news release
      includes forecasted EBITDA. This is a non-GAAP financial measure.
      Forecasted EBITDA is based on the Partnership’s projections for the
      assets to be acquired. Forecasted EBITDA is included to help facilitate
      comparisons of operating performance of the Partnership with other
      companies in our industry, as well as help facilitate an assessment of
      our assets' projected ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make
      distributions to our partners. Forecasted EBITDA is not presented as an
      alternative to the nearest GAAP financial measure, net income, and
      should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of
      performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are unable to present a
      reconciliation of forecasted EBITDA to net income because certain
      elements of net income, including interest, depreciation and taxes, are
      not available. Together, these items generally result in EBITDA being
      significantly greater than net income.
