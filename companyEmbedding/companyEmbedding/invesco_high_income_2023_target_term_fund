Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Ratings are based on S&P, Moody's or Fitch, as applicable. A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. NR indicates the debtor was not rated, and should not be interpreted as indicating low quality. If securities are rated differently by the rating agencies, the higher rating is applied. Credit ratings are based largely on the rating agency's investment analysis at the time of rating and the rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection of the issuer's current financial condition. The rating assigned to a security by a rating agency does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. For more information on the rating methodology, please visit the following NRSRO websites: www.standardandpoors.com and select 'Understanding Ratings' under Rating Resources on the homepage; www.moodys.com and select 'Rating Methodologies' under Research and Ratings on the homepage; www.fitchratings.com and select 'Ratings Definitions' on the homepage.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

As the Fund approaches its Termination Date, the Fund may earn interest income at a more modest rate. As a result, the Fund's distributions during the wind-down period of approximately three to twelve months preceding the Termination Date may consist, in whole or in part, of a return of capital. 

CMBS differ from conventional debt securities because principal is paid back over the life of the security rather than at maturity. CMBS are subject to prepayment or call risk, which is the risk that a borrower’s payments may be received earlier than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans. An unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool will adversely affect the value of CMBS and will result in losses to the Fund. 

Junk bonds involve a greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuer’s credit quality. The values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high quality bonds and can decline significantly over short time periods. 

Because the assets of the Fund will be liquidated in connection with its termination, the Fund may be required to sell portfolio securities when
it otherwise would not, including at times when market conditions are not favorable, or at a time when a particular security is in default or bankruptcy, or otherwise in severe distress, which may cause the Fund to lose money. 

The Fund’s anticipated use of leverage by issuing Preferred Shares and other senior debt securities creates special risks for Common Shareholders, including potential interest rate risks and the likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of, and distributions on, the Common Shares.

Invesco High Income 2023 Target Term Fund Enters into Repurchase Facility
BY PR Newswire— 4:15 PM ET 03/17/2017



ATLANTA, March 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Invesco Advisers Inc. ("Invesco (IVZ)") announced today that Invesco High Income 2023 Target Term Fund (the "Fund") has entered into a commercial mortgage backed securities ("CMBS") repurchase facility (the "Facility").  The Fund anticipates using the Facility as a form of leverage to seek to enhance its potential to produce a high level of current income and to return $9.835 per share to Common Shareholders on or about December 1, 2023 (the Fund's termination date).  The Facility will permit the Fund to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions in which the Fund will receive cash and will transfer CMBS to a bank in exchange for a simultaneous agreement by the bank to sell the CMBS back to the Fund at a future date, resulting in the Fund having access to additional cash to invest while maintaining its portfolio of investments.



The Facility will expose the Fund to interest rate risk, including the risk associated with financing fixed rate instruments with floating rate debt.  An increase in prevailing interest rates will result in increased costs associated with using the Facility.  Additionally, the use of leverage, such as the Facility, creates additional risks for Common Shareholders, including increased variability of the Fund's net asset value, net income and distributions in relation to market changes.  In particular, leverage increases the risk of price volatility. The Fund's use of leverage may not work as planned or achieve its goals.  
Both the anticipated amount of leverage utilized by the Fund and the costs of leverage associated with the Facility are projected to be lower than was expected at the Fund's launch. Invesco believes that by entering into the Facility, Invesco (IVZ) will enhance its ability to manage the Fund's portfolio in the best interests of shareholders and to meet the Fund's investment objectives.
