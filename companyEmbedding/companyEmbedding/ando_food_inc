Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.

Produce
Our produce is a sight to behold. It's like we got it from Central Casting: a visual feast of color, variety and sparkling freshness piled high for your pleasure and convenience. Cue the credits.



Meat & Poultry
If you’re looking for “natural meat,” we’re looking out for you, because that term only means no additives in the finished product. We go further with great-tasting meat from animals raised with no antibiotics, ever, and no added hormones*. Plus, our farmer and rancher partners follow strict standards for farm-animal welfare. And we’ve got you covered when it comes to local, grass-fed and organic, too.



Seafood
Our Seafood Department is the top reason many shoppers give for coming to our stores. Not only will you find a wide selection of fresh and frozen, high-quality seafood, we source only from sustainable fisheries and responsible farms. You can shop with confidence, and our fishmongers are ready with a smile.

Add Share Button To Marquee Box:  Produce
Our produce is a sight to behold. It's the first thing you see when you come into one of our stores: a visual feast of color, variety and sparkling freshness piled high for your pleasure and convenience.
The quality of produce at our stores is simply second to none. Our produce buyers, based in all regions of the country, maintain relationships with our local growers and our field inspectors are on the road 52 weeks a year seeking out the best of the best.
Organic produce is a mainstay for us. Early on, we committed to offering as much organic produce as available because we believe organic farming supports a healthy environment. Fresh fruits and vegetables grown without the use of long-lasting chemical pesticides and fertilizers will always have a prominent place on our shelves.
We feature local produce in season. While the definition of local varies by region of the country, it generally means one day’s drive away or less, and it's usually much less. Ask a produce team member where your store’s local produce comes from and when your favorite items will be in season.
We know that you like to know where your food comes from, so we display the origin of every piece of produce we sell. To meet customer demand, we do our best to offer the highestquality fruits and vegetables year-round, so we use our experience and relationships with growers from around the world to obtain the best of what's "in season" in other parts of the world.
Devotion to quality and service is a daily mantra in every one of our produce departments. That's why you can find just about anything you want there, from the humble to the exotic, from bananas to Buddha's hand (in season, of course!). Come in and explore. You're bound to find something delicious.
