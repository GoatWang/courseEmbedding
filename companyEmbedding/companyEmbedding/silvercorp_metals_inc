History[edit]
The company started out as a minor explorer trading on the TSX venture exchange from November 1991 to October 2005 (was incorporated under the British Columbia Company Act in 1991). At first it was known as Spokane Resources Ltd until 2001 when it was renamed SKN Resources Ltd. In 2005, the same year it graduated from the TSX Venture Exchange to the larger Toronto exchange, it adopted its current name. In 2006, Silvercorp donated RMB1.25 million towards the construction of a youth center in Luoning County, Henan Province, China.[1]
Fraud[edit]
In 2011 a Canadian-nationalized Chinese, Kun Huang, investigated Silvercorp for his employer EOSfunds and found strong differences between their reports filed in China and in Canada.[2] Further investigation lead to further proofs for fraud, e.g. regarding the reported amount of silver produced. As reaction of detecting the fraud Mr. Huang was convicted and imprisoned in China for his investigation. After release Mr Huang pressed charges against Silvercorp in Canada for false imprisonment.[3]

About Silvercorp
Facilitated by China's 1997 Mineral Resource Law, Silvercorp first entered China in 2003 to capitalize on the country's vastly underexplored geological potential. While the Chinese government invested tremendously in geological exploration in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to many discoveries, very little capital or advanced exploration technology was available to exploit them fully. China's 1997 Mineral Resource Law was adopted specifically to enable foreign mining companies to explore and mine in the country -- inviting in the advanced exploration technology, expertise and funding China needed to truly develop its resources.

In 2004, Silvercorp acquired the Ying project, a small producing mine in the Henan province, and exploration over the next two years led to the discovery of high-grade silver-lead-zinc mineralization in a multitude of narrow veins similar to the prolific Coeur d'Alene silver district in Idaho, U.S.A. On March 31, 2006, Silvercorp received its first mining permit from the Ministry of Land & Resources and commercial production of silver, lead and zinc from the Ying mine began the next day. Following on its success at the Ying mine, Silvercorp acquired three nearby mines – HPG, TLP & LM – to consolidate the Ying Mining District in 2007.

Today, Silvercorp is China's largest publicly listed primary silver producer, with annual production of 5.0 million ounces of silver in fiscal year 2016. The Company also produced 52.5 million pounds of lead, 17.5 million pounds of zinc and 2,400 ounces of gold during the same period. In addition to its operational success, Silvercorp is considered a preferred mining company in the Henan province, having built a solid reputation for upholding high safety and environmental standards and for supporting local community initiatives. Additionally, Silvercorp has become the largest non-state-controlled company and one of the top tax payers in Luoyang City. This strong brand name has been instrumental in gaining and building the support of city, county and provincial governments.
Silvercorp recently commenced commercial production at its GC silver-lead-zinc project in Guangdong Province, its newest production base in China. While the Company's near team focus is on cost control, cash preservation, and protecting its strong balance sheet, longer term Silvercorp plans to continue its growth through future consolidation, exploration, mine development and acquisition, with a focus in China.
Corporate Background
The Company’s shares are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) under the symbol “SVM”, and on NYSE MKT also under the symbol “SVM”, and the Company is a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
Strategy
Long-term Goals
With over $97million in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, no debt, robust operations, and high quality development projects, Silvercorp plans to grow through future consolidation, exploration, mine development and acquisition.

It is China's largest primary silver producer. The company is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada and the NYSE in the U.S.
As of 2009, Silvercorp Metals was operating and developing four silver/lead/zinc mines in an area encompassing the Ying silver/lead/zinc project, Hou Ping Gou project, the TLP silver/lead project and the Long Men project (the Ying Mining District), owned through its 77.5% and 70% Chinese subsidiary companies, respectively.

History[edit]
The company started out as a minor explorer trading on the TSX venture exchange from November 1991 to October 2005 (was incorporated under the British Columbia Company Act in 1991). At first it was known as Spokane Resources Ltd until 2001 when it was renamed SKN Resources Ltd. In 2005, the same year it graduated from the TSX Venture Exchange to the larger Toronto exchange, it adopted its current name. In 2006, Silvercorp donated RMB1.25 million towards the construction of a youth center in Luoning County, Henan Province, China.[1]
Fraud[edit]
In 2011 a Canadian-nationalized Chinese, Kun Huang, investigated Silvercorp for his employer EOSfunds and found strong differences between their reports filed in China and in Canada.[2] Further investigation lead to further proofs for fraud, e.g. regarding the reported amount of silver produced. As reaction of detecting the fraud Mr. Huang was convicted and imprisoned in China for his investigation. After release Mr Huang pressed charges against Silvercorp in Canada for false imprisonment.[3]

OPERATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT 
In Fiscal 2017, the Company sold 6.5 million ounces of silver, 3,300 ounces of gold, 70.5 million pounds of lead, and 18.3 million pounds of zinc, compared to 5.0 million ounces of silver, 2,400 ounces of gold, 52.5 million pounds of lead, and 17.5 million pounds of zinc, respectively, in Fiscal 2016.  The increase of metals sold was mainly due to: i) a 6% increase in ore milled, and ii) a 12%, 16% and 15% increase in the head grades of silver, lead and zinc head grades, resulting largely from the ongoing dilution control measures and operation management improvements.
1. Ying Mining District, Henan Province, China 

In Fiscal 2017, total ore mined at the Ying Mining District was 636,760 tonnes, an 8% increase compared to 589,766 tonnes mined in the prior year.  Correspondently, ore milled increased by 9% to 638,211 tonnes from 587,450 tonnes in the prior year. Silver, lead and zinc head grades improved by 13%, 20% and 19%, respectively, to 303 grams per tonne ("g/t") for silver, 4.7% for lead and 1.0% for zinc from 268 g/t for silver, 3.9% for lead and 0.8% for zinc in the prior year, resulting largely from the ongoing dilution control and operation management improvements.   
Silver, gold, lead, and zinc metals sold in Fiscal 2017 at the Ying Mining District was up by 35%, 43%, 46% and 13%, respectively, to approximately 5.9 million ounces silver, 3,300 ounces gold, 63.4 million pounds lead, and 5.8 million pounds zinc from 4.4 million ounces silver, 2,300 ounces gold, 43.5 million pounds lead, and 5.2 million pounds of zinc. 
Total and cash mining costs per tonne at the Ying Mining District in Fiscal 2017 were $74.04 and $51.79 per tonne, respectively, compared to $79.93 and $56.90 per tonne in the prior year. The decrease in cash mining costs was mainly due to: i) a 4% decrease in per tonne labour costs, and ii) a 28% decrease in per tonne mining preparation costs. 
Total and cash milling costs per tonne at the Ying Mining District in Fiscal 2017 were $11.73 and $9.50, a decrease of 21% and 23%, respectively, compared to $14.91 and $12.34 in Fiscal 2016. The decrease in cash milling costs was mainly due to i) an 8% decrease in per tonne labor costs, ii) a 20% reduction in raw material costs, iii) a 10% decrease in per tonne utility costs, and iv) the exclusion of mineral resources tax from milling costs. Prior to June 30, 2016, mineral resource tax was levied at RMB¥13.0 per tonne of ore milled and included as part of milling costs. Effective July 1, 2016, the mineral resource tax has been changed to a levy based on a certain percentage of sales, and therefore such tax is excluded from milling costs but expensed and included directly as part of cost of sales.
Correspondingly, cash production costs per tonne of ore processed in Fiscal 2017 at the Ying Mining District was $65.17, an 11% decrease compared to $73.25 in the prior year due to the decrease in both per tonne cash mining and milling costs.
Cash costs per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, in Fiscal 2017 at the Ying Mining District, was negative $2.70 compared to $1.38 in the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to i) lower per tonne cash production costs as discussed above, and ii) a 73% increase in by-product credits mainly arising from 46% and 13% increase in lead and zinc metals sold and 19% and 37% increase in net realized lead and zinc selling prices. Sales from lead and zinc accounted for 39% of the total sales at the Ying Mining District in Fiscal 2017, and amounted to $55.8 million, an increase of $23.5 million, compared to $32.3 million in the prior year.
All in sustaining costs per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, in Fiscal 2017 at the Ying Mining District was $2.61 compared to $8.60 in the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to lower cash costs per ounce of silver as discussed above.
In Fiscal 2017, approximately 93,755 meters ("m") of underground diamond drilling (Fiscal 2016 – 63,398 m) and 17,787 m of preparation tunnelling (Fiscal 2016 – 19,113 m) were completed and expensed as mining preparation costs at the Ying Mining District. In addition, approximately 60,241 m of horizontal tunnel, raises and declines (58,268 m) were completed and capitalized.  Total exploration and development expenditures capitalized at the Ying Mining District in Fiscal 2017 were $18.1 million compared to $18.9 million in Fiscal 2016.
In Q4 Fiscal 2017, the Company mined 112,755 tonnes of ore at the Ying Mining District, a 13% increase compared to 99,415 tonnes in Q4 Fiscal 2016. Correspondently, ore milled increased by 9% to 108,051 tonnes from 99,203 tonnes in the prior year quarter. Head grades were 298 gram per tonne ("g/t") for silver, 4.8% for lead, and 0.8% for zinc in Q4 Fiscal 2017, compared to 310 g/t for silver, 4.0% for lead, and 0.9% for zinc in Q4 Fiscal 2016. 
Silver, lead, and zinc metals sold in Q4 Fiscal 2017 at the Ying Mining District was up by 46%, 83%, and 3%, respectively, to approximately 1.3 million ounces silver, 13.5 million pounds lead, and 1.0 million pounds zinc from 0.9 million ounces silver, 7.4 million pounds lead, and 1.0 million pounds of zinc. 
In Q4 Fiscal 2017, the total and cash mining costs per tonne, at the Ying Mining District, were $53.50 and $49.99, compared to $83.24 and $54.63 in Q4 Fiscal 2016. The decrease in per tonne cash mining costs was mainly due to higher output resulting in lower per tonne labor costs and mine administration costs.
The total milling and cash milling cost per tonne in Q4 Fiscal 2017 at the Ying Mining District was $13.60 and $10.43, a decrease of 22% and 24%, respectively, compared to $17.38 and $13.70 in the prior year period. The decrease in cash milling costs was mainly due to i) a 16% decrease in per tonne labor costs, ii) a 25% reduction in raw material costs, and iii) the exclusion of mineral resources tax from milling costs as discussed above.
Correspondingly, cash production costs per tonne of ore processed in Q4 Fiscal 2017 at the Ying Mining District was $64.34, an 11% decrease compared to $71.90 in the prior year quarter due to the decrease in both per tonne cash mining and milling costs.
Cash costs per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, at the Ying Mining District, was negative $3.73 in Q4 Fiscal 2017 compared to $2.83 in Q4 Fiscal 2016. The decrease was mainly due to: i) lower per tonne cash production costs as discussed above, and ii) a 90% increase in by-product credits arising from 83% and 3% increase in lead and zinc metals sold and 36% and 115% increase in net realized lead and zinc selling prices. Sales from lead and zinc accounted for 43% of the total sales at the Ying Mining District in the current quarter, and amounted to $13.8 million, an increase of $8.2 million, compared to $5.6 million in the prior year quarter.
All in sustaining costs per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, at the Ying Mining District in Q4 Fiscal 2017 was $0.74 per ounce of silver compared to $8.92 in Q4 Fiscal 2016. The decrease was mainly due to the lower per tonne cash production costs and the increase in by-product credits as discussed above.  
2.  GC Mine, Guangdong Province, China

In Fiscal 2017, total ore mined at the GC Mine was 260,746 tonnes, a 1% increase compared to 257,575 tonnes of mined in Fiscal 2016.  Correspondingly, ore milled increased by 1% to 260,696 tonnes from 256,862 tonnes in the prior year. Head grades were 94 g/t for silver, 1.4% for lead, and 2.8% for zinc compared to 94 g/t for silver, 1.8% for lead, and 2.5% for zinc in the prior year. 
In Fiscal 2017, GC Mine sold 564 thousand ounces of silver, 7.1 million pounds of lead, 12.4 million pounds of zinc compared to 637 thousand ounces of silver, 9.0 million pounds of lead, and 12.3 million pounds of zinc sold in the prior year.   
Total and cash mining costs per tonne at the GC Mine in Fiscal 2017 were $40.03 and $32.1 per tonne, compared to $46.49 and $38.23 per tonne in Fiscal 2016. The decrease in cash mining costs was mainly because approximately 35% of ore was by-product ore from exploration tunnelling or extracted from previously mined stopes for which direct mining costs were paid in prior years and the only cost involved was to ship the ore to the mill.  
Total and cash milling costs per tonne at the GC Mine in Fiscal 2017 were $17.78 and $14.73, compared to $18.30 and $15.79, respectively, in Fiscal 2016. The decrease in milling costs was mainly due to the exclusion of mineral resources from milling costs as discussed above.
Correspondingly, cash production costs per tonne of ore processed in Fiscal 2017 at the GC Mine decreased by 13% to $46.83 from $54.02 in the prior year due to the decrease in both per tonne cash mining and milling costs.
Cash costs per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, at the GC Mine, was negative $6.47 compared to $1.85 in the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to: i) lower per tonne cash production costs as discussed above, and ii) a 12% increase in by-product credits, mainly arising from more zinc sold and a 19% and 33% increase in net realized lead and zinc selling prices. Sales from lead and zinc accounted for 69% of the total sales at the GC Mine in Fiscal 2017, and amounted to $14.3 million, an increase of $1.8 million, compared to $12.5 million in the prior year.
All in sustaining costs per ounce of silver, net of by-product credits, in Fiscal 2017 at the GC Mine was $0.20 compared to $8.81 in the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to lower cash costs per ounce of silver and less corporate expenditures and sustaining capital expenditures incurred.
In Fiscal 2017, approximately 12,484 m of underground diamond drilling (Fiscal 2016 – 20,556 m) and 14,690 m of tunnelling (Fiscal 2016 – 13,570 m) were completed and expensed as mining preparation costs at the GC Mine. In addition, approximately 1,721 m of horizontal tunnel, raises and declines (Fiscal 2016 – 1,409 m) were completed and capitalized.  Total exploration and development expenditures capitalized at the GC Mine in Fiscal 2017 were $0.7 million compared to $0.9 million in Fiscal 2016.
In Q4 Fiscal 2017, the Company mined 40,224 tonnes of ore at the GC Mine, a 20% decrease compared to 50,014 tonnes in the prior year quarter. Correspondingly, ore milled decreased by 20% to 39,929 tonnes from 50,124 tonnes in Q4 Fiscal 2016. Head grades were 91 g/t for silver, 1.3% for lead, and 2.6% for zinc in Q4 Fiscal 2017, compared to 92 g/t for silver, 2.0% for lead, and 2.7% for zinc in the prior year quarter. 
Silver, lead, and zinc metals sold in Q4 Fiscal 2017 at the GC Mine was down by 55%, 58%, and 82%, respectively, to approximately 53 thousand ounces silver, 818 thousand pounds lead, and 455 thousand pounds zinc from 118 thousand ounces silver, 2.0 million pounds lead, and 2.6 million pounds of zinc.  The decrease was mainly due to: i) lower production in Q4 Fiscal 2017, and ii) increase in concentrate inventory. As at March 31, 2017, GC mine was holding 198 tonnes of lead concentrate inventory and 1,503 tonnes of zinc concentrate inventory, an increase of 127 tonnes and 1,469 tonnes, respectively, compared to 71 tonnes of lead concentrate and 34 tonnes of zinc concentrates held as at March 31, 2016, and an increase of 188 tonnes and 1,494 tonnes, respectively, compared to 10 tonnes of lead concentrate and 29 tonnes of zinc concentrate held as at December 31, 2016.
In Q4 Fiscal 2017, the total and cash mining costs per tonne, at the GC Mine, were $45.37 and $37.91, compared to $34.76 and $26.24 in the prior year period. The increase in per tonne cash mining costs was mainly due to lower output resulting in higher per tonne labor costs and mine administration costs.  The lower output was due to the annual Chinese New Year, which reduced mine operations to only two months during the quarter.  
The total milling and cash milling costs per tonne in Q4 Fiscal 2017 at the GC Mine was $24.99 and $20.06, compared to $20.67 and $16.99 in the prior year quarter. The increase in per tonne milling costs was mainly due to lower output resulting in higher per tonne fixed overhead costs allocated. 
Correspondingly, cash production costs per tonne of ore processed in Q4 Fiscal 2017 at the GC Mine increased to $57.97 from $43.23 in the prior year quarter due to the increase in both per tonne cash mining and milling costs.
