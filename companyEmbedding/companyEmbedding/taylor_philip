Choose from various styles, colors, shapes and textures to create the perfect look for your home. EXTRA 10% OFFSelect Furniture*Shop NowRelated Product ReviewsMy favorite new couch!Could not be happier with this couch. It honestly looks more beautiful in person. The sofa is made of luxuriously soft velvet, which makes snuggling on the sofa even nicer. I love the fact that these beautiful pillows come as a set. They are very sturdy, durable, and true to color.Love the Sofa!So very happy with the sofa!  I am going to purchase the loveseat next. Love the look and feel of the linen fabric. Sofa is very attractive. Great sofaI ordered 2 of these sofas for a clubhouse and they are not only great looking but they are comfortable. Best couch ever! I have the loveseat and sofa bed couch, they are very heavy very well made. I have had alot of couches these are the best!!!NiceI love this sofa set. Looks exact same like a picture. I ordered gray sofa set and I am very satisfied with this product Beautiful sofaI ordered two 4 seat sofas and I can't begin to say how big and beautiful it is. The color is light grey as shown and the sofa is nicely firm. The sofa is low in height but was perfect for the area I needed it in may change the legs to your liking if the height is to low. The sofas sit deep which I like you can sit or lay comfortably in it with no problem.  Not much assembly to be done except lining the sofa pieces together and sliding them into each groove easier done with 2 people. Looks beautiful and expensive I would recommend this to sofa to others. My mom loved it so much she ordered the same sofa for her home.Looks great, but smallThis is not really a sofa, it's more of a loveseat. Check the dimensions before buying. No adult could lie down on it. I bought it to be the centerpiece sofa in a room, and I regret that, because it is not big enough. But it is otherwise fine.So comfy!We ordered this sofa for our office and it is so elegant and comfortable!this sofa is not real sturdy but looks great.This is not a real sturdy sofa but it look good and is comfortable

About Tayco Door Linings.

Tayco Building Products Ltd was established in 1985 by Philip Taylor who, after a fifteen year career in the sale of doors for two leading national door manufacturers, recognised that there was a gap in the market for the supply of pre manufactured door lining sets. At this time we produced standard door lining sets for the builders merchants market, then at the start of the nineties we began to supply bespoke door lining sets in increasing numbers to building contractors and housing developers across the South West.









When Will Taylor joined his father in 1999 the business soon outgrew its location and moved to its current premises where we now mill all our own timber, ensuring that our high quality and standard are maintained. We have nurtured several key customer relationships over the years and can now supply anywhere nationwide. We have a good number of repeat customers who have been with us for many years which gives us the confidence that our product, service and competitive pricing levels are second to none.

 
 
 








Having traded for over 30 years coupled with our combined experience in the construction industry, we can provide authoritative solutions and advice for any building development. Tayco continues to grow as a family business and supported by a dedicated production team and experienced joiners we now specialise in the manufacture of quality, bespoke, door encasement products.
