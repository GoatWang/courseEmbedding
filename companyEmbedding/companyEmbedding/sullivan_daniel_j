Life and career[edit]
Sullivan was born in Wray, Colorado, the son of Mary Catherine (née Hutton) and John Martin Sullivan.[1] He was raised in San Francisco, where he graduated from San Francisco State University. In 1963, he began his professional career as an actor at the city's Actor's Workshop, where he remained for two years.
Sullivan worked as both an actor and director with the Lincoln Center Repertory Company in the late 1960s and 1970s. His directorial debut there was A.R. Gurney's Scenes from American Life in 1971.[2] for which he won a Drama Desk Award.
After two years as Resident Director of the Seattle Repertory Theatre, he assumed the position of Artistic Director in 1981, serving until 1997. It was there that he directed the first production of his own play, Inspecting Carol.[3]
Sullivan has forged successful working relationships with many prominent American playwrights. He directed Herb Gardner's Tony winning I'm Not Rappaport at Seattle Rep before staging it off-Broadway, on Broadway, in London's West End, and the United States national tour. He reteamed with Gardner to stage Conversations with My Father in Seattle, New York City, and Los Angeles. His first association with Wendy Wasserstein was the Pulitzer Prize and Tony-winning The Heidi Chronicles, which he directed off Broadway, on Broadway and its National Tour. The duo later collaborated on The Sisters Rosensweig on Broadway and the National Tour, An American Daughter, and Ms. Wasserstein's final play, Third. He directed both the off-Broadway and screen version of Jon Robin Baitz's The Substance of Fire, as well as the original productions of A Fair Country and Ten Unknowns in New York, and Baitz's translation of Hedda Gabler in Los Angeles. His collaborations with Donald Margulies include the Pulitzer-Prize-winning Dinner With Friends in New York and Los Angeles, the Broadway revival of Sight Unseen, and the Broadway productions of Brooklyn Boy and the 2010 Broadway production of Time Stands Still.
Sullivan has directed most of Charlayne Woodard's plays: Pretty Fire (Seattle Rep, 1994-95), Neat (Seattle Rep, 1996–97), Stories (Seattle Rep, May 1999),[4] In Real Life (Mark Taper Forum, July 2001 and Manhattan Theatre Club, October 2002)[5] and The Nightwatcher.
Other Broadway credits include Retreat From Moscow, Morning's at Seven, Proof, Major Barbara, A Moon for the Misbegotten, Accent on Youth, The Homecoming, Rabbit Hole, Prelude to a Kiss, After The Night And The Music, Julius Caesar, and Ah, Wilderness.[6] For Shakespeare in the Park at the Delacorte, Sullivan directed The Merry Wives of Windsor, A Midsummer Night’s Dream (2007)[7] and Twelfth Night (2009).[8]
Other Off-Broadway credits include Stuff Happens, Intimate Apparel, Ancestral Voices, Spinning Into Butter, Far East, London Suite, Psychopathia Sexualis The American Clock, and Good People.
At The Old Globe Theatre, Sullivan directed Julius Caesar, Cymbeline (1999),[9]Romeo and Juliet(1998),[10] Merry Wives of Windsor and Othello, and at South Coast Repertory he directed Hamlet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Taming of the Shrew and Volpone.
Sullivan's Broadway acting credits include the 1973 revival of A Streetcar Named Desire, The Merchant of Venice (1973), The Playboy of the Western World (1971),[6]The Good Woman of Setzuan, and Camino Real.
In addition to his directing, Sullivan currently holds the Swanlund Chair at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

Daniel J. Sullivan - Eastern Real Estate















































 















 











 




Daniel J. Sullivan
Director of Development
As Director of Development at Eastern Real Estate, Dan Sullivan is involved in all aspects of real estate development for the firm—overseeing site selection, feasibility analysis, entitlements, leasing and construction management.
His recent projects include the revitalization of the turn-of-the-century Historic Custom House in Portland, Oregon; development of a portfolio consisting of industrial, retail and 350 acres of land located in the Las Vegas, Nevada, market; and ground-up development and entitlement of an office/retail/research and development project in the Central Coast region of California.
Dan’s background includes all facets of commercial development, leasing and construction management. Product type experience includes retail, office, industrial, medical office, hospitality and data center/telecom facilities. Dan’s experience includes tenure at Homart Development, where his team successfully leased and developed several million square feet of the company’s open-air retail centers located throughout the Northeast.
Dan is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a double major in real estate and finance. He regularly volunteers his expertise in construction, project management and planning for numerous charitable causes, including his church and public park district. In one example, he helped a nonprofit organization redevelop a portfolio of underutilized assets into a daycare center, charter school, community center, autism center and Veterans homeless facility. These newly redeveloped and vibrant properties now serve the needs of those living in some of the country’s most impoverished neighborhoods.

Product DescriptionAn Introduction to Philosophy by Daniel J. Sullivan is intended for the general reader as well as for the student. Its primary purpose is to present the elements of philosophy with simplicity and clarity in order to arouse that sense of wonder which Aristotle says is the beginning of the love of wisdom. This well-structured overview begins with an historical study of philosophy, tracing the evolution of philosophical problems from their simplest origins, and continues with an analysis of the more concrete problems about man himself. The more abstract problems of man and his relation to the world around him make up the final study of this book. Sullivan works in the great classical, realist tradition of Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, and their modern-day inheritors, exposing the perennially valid and vital principles of philosophy and emphasizing the profound moral and social implications of these principles. He respects the distinction between natural and revealed wisdom, but does not hesitate to point out how the conclusions of philosophy are complemented by the truths of revelation. An Introduction to Philosophy clearly demonstrates that philosophy is a good deal more than a classroom exerciseMore Product InformationPublisher: Tan Books

Publisher's Description▼▲
AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY by Daniel J. Sullivan is intended for the general reader as well as for the student. Its primary purpose is to present the elements of philosophy with simplicity and clarity in order to arouse that sense of wonder which Aristotle says is the beginning of the love of wisdom.   This well-structured overview begins with an historical study of philosophy, tracing the evolution of philosophical problems from their simplest origins, and continues with an analysis of the more concrete problems about man himself. The more abstract problems of man and his relation to the world around him make up the final study of this book.   Sullivan works in the great classical, realist tradition of Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, and their modern-day inheritors, exposing the perennially valid and vital principles of philosophy and emphasizing the profound moral and social implications of these principles. He respects the distinction between natural and revealed wisdom, but does not hesitate to point out how the conclusions of philosophy are complemented by the truths of revelation.   AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY clearly demonstrates that philosophy is a good deal more than a classroom exercise.


Author Bio▼▲
Daniel J. Sullivan intended An Introduction to Philosophy to be used by the general reader as well as the student. A secondary purpose, as mentioned in the foreword, was to smooth the transition from literary imagery to philosophical abstraction. The book was dedicated to Emmanuel C. Chapman and published in 1957 by The Bruce Publishing Company, based in Milwaukee. It received the Nihil Obstat as well as the Imprimatur and was reprinted in 1992 and again in 2009.
