Tom Bryfczynski began his career in the alcoholic beverage industry in 1982 at ShopKo
			Liquor. He worked his way up in the retail industry over the following 26 years from stock
			to sales, to inventory control, management and ownership.
Over time, his focus on retail wine sales resulted in the development of the area's first
			wine shop. Through this, he developed strong relationships and friendships with some of the
			best winemakers in the world.
Tom continually strove to increase his knowledge of wines. It was his knowledge and
			his California connections that allowed him to develop the first and largest charity wine tasting
			in Northeast Wisconsin, helping to raise over $1.5 million for the Boys & Girls Club
			of Green Bay.
Tom was here at the beginnings of Legacy Brands and has taken his wine knowledge to the wholesale level. When
			Triangle Distributing made the decision to diversify, expanding into wine, Gary Ziegelbauer
			chose Tom to lead the wine division now known as Legacy Brands. Tom's connections have already
			made Legacy a strong and respected wine distributor with great plans for the future.
In his free time, Tom enjoys spending time with his wife, Sue, and two children.

An Exhibition of Spatial Interventions Reflecting on the Inquiry of Scale







Join us from June 19, 2014 to August 31, 2014 for an exhibition of spatial interventions.

Historically, Los Angeles as a city has been a site of inspiration and exploration for architects and designers alike. The city has been developed around and defined by a variety of large-scale urban planning prjects as well as medium and smaller sized residential and public work including housing, product design and technological innovations. Through these variation architecture and design projects, the city has nurtured experimental pursuits and critical inquiry and today it continues to expand in the contemporaneous city.
Projects are currently being developed at various scales all over L.A. from minuscule to monumental and everything in-between. SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, EXTRA-LARGE LOS ANGELES takes Rem Koolhaas and Bruce Maus seminal text as a departure point and more importantly as an organizing principle to examine the production and discourse of architecture and design within todays city of L.A. bringing coherence to the body of work of an emergent group of Los Angeles based designers that span across multiple disciplines from architecture and graphics to digital media and sound art, to jewelry, landscape, lighting, product, and textile design; the show highlight the ways in which young practitioners are currently thinking and making in Los Angeles in addition to their impact on the present-day city and it’s future.
