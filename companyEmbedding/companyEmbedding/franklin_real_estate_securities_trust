GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)







                              Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                              structure combines the specialized expertise of
                              three world-class investment management
                              groups--Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE         Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                              autonomously, relying on its own research and
                              staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                              that underlie its success.

                              FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                              recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                              also brings expertise in growth- and value-style
                              U.S. equity investing.

                              TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                              international investing and, in 1954, launched
                              what has become the industry's oldest global fund.
                              Today, with offices in over 25 countries,
                              Templeton offers investors a truly global
                              perspective.

                              MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                              dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                              searching aggressively for opportunity among what
                              it believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                              arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION          Because our management groups work independently
                              and adhere to different investment approaches,
                              Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
                              typically have distinct portfolios. That's why our
                              funds can be used to build truly diversified
                              allocation plans covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST     At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                              consistently provide investors with exceptional
                              risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well
                              as the reliable, accurate and personal service
                              that has helped us become one of the most trusted

This semiannual report for Franklin Real Estate Securities Fund covers the
six-month period ended October 31, 2005.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW



Franklin Real Estate Securities Fund - Class A posted a +9.33% cumulative total
return for the six months under review. The Fund underperformed its narrow
benchmark, the Dow Jones Wilshire Real Estate Securities Index, which returned

+10.74%. On the other hand, the Fund outperformed its broad benchmark, the
Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index (S&P 500), which returned +5.26% for the
same period.(2) You can find the Fund's long-term performance data in the
Performance Summary beginning on page 8.



ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW



During the six months ended October 31, 2005, domestic economic expansion was
driven by strength across most industries, sectors and regions. Gross domestic
product (GDP) rose during the period, benefiting primarily from increased
personal consumption, business investment and federal spending. Slower export
growth combined with greater demand for imported goods


(1)   Equity REITs are real estate companies that own and manage
income-producing properties such as apartments or hotels. The income,
primarily rent from these properties, is generally passed on to investors
in the form of dividends. These companies provide experienced property
management teams and generally concentrate on a specific geographic region
and property type.


(2)   Source: Standard & Poor's Micropal. The Dow Jones Wilshire Real Estate
Securities Index is a broad measure of the performance of publicly traded
real estate securities, such as REITs and real estate operating companies.
The index is capitalization weighted and rebalanced monthly, and returns
are calculated on a buy-and-hold basis. The S&P 500 consists of 500 stocks
chosen for market size, liquidity and industry group representation. Each
stock's weight in the index is proportionate to its market value. The S&P
500 is one of the most widely used benchmarks of U.S. equity performance.
The indexes are unmanaged and include reinvested dividends. One cannot
invest directly in an index, nor is an index representative of the Fund's
portfolio.

and materials fueled a widening trade gap. The U.S. dollar rallied in 2005
driven largely by rising short-term domestic interest rates, and strong economic
growth in the U.S. relative to many of its major trading partners.


Oil prices increased substantially during the period largely due to potential
long-term supply limitations and strong growth in global demand, especially from
China and India. Despite rising commodity prices, inflation remained relatively
contained for the 12 months ended October 31, 2005, as measured by the 2.1% rise
for the core Consumer Price Index (CPI).(3) With this inflation picture, the
Federal Reserve Board raised the federal funds target rate from 2.75% to 3.75%,
and said it would continue to undertake appropriate monetary policy action at a
measured pace. Compared with the rise in short-term interest rates, long-term
interest rates remained relatively stable, supporting overall robust housing and
commercial real estate activity, which contributed to economic growth.


Many businesses enjoyed their widest profit margins on record, propelled largely
by productivity gains. The labor market firmed as employment increased and the
unemployment rate dropped from 5.2% to 5.0% during the reporting period.(3)
Personal income rose, and hiring rebounded in many industries, bolstered by
healthy business spending. However, late in the period consumer sentiment fell
amid concerns about rising energy costs.


Real estate securities continued to perform well during the six months under
review. Industry fundamentals improved in certain property types such as office
and multi-family units and remained strong in retail. The residential market
continued to post impressive growth despite concerns of a potential housing
bubble. However, the steady rise in interest rates was a concern for both the
real estate and general stock markets due to the increasing attractiveness of
fixed income investments.


In this environment, the blue chip stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
posted a six-month total return of +3.57%, while the broader S&P 500 and the
technology-heavy NASDAQ Composite Index returned +5.26% and +10.78%.(4)

costs.

price weighted based on the average market price of 30 blue chip stocks of
companies that are generally industry leaders. See footnote 2 for a
description of the S&P 500. The NASDAQ Composite Index measures all NASDAQ
domestic and international based common type stocks listed on The NASDAQ
Stock Market. The index is market value weighted and includes more than
3,000 companies.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY



We use a fundamental, value-oriented, long-term approach, focusing primarily on
the market price of a company's securities relative to our evaluation of the
company's long-term earnings, asset value and cash flow growth potential. In
addition, we analyze supply and demand trends and outlooks for various property
types and regional markets while evaluating company management and a security's
underlying properties.







MANAGER'S DISCUSSION



During the six months ended October 31, 2005, Fund performance benefited from
industry consolidation as a flurry of mergers and acquisitions drove REIT share
prices higher. Among the notable transactions that occurred during the period
and contributed to Fund performance were ProLogis' acquisition of Catellus
Development and Ventas' purchase of Provident Senior Living. ProLogis is now
considered the world's largest network of distribution facilities and services,
with more than 368 million square feet in over 2,305 facilities. The company was
recently estimated to have more than 133 million square feet of development
potential in international markets and should benefit from a growing global
economy. Also contributing to Fund performance was the Fund's position in
AvalonBay Communities, one of the premier multi-family unit operators in the
U.S. AvalonBay shares appreciated 22% during the review period.


The Fund also had some detractors from performance including its stake in
mortgage finance operator Doral Financial. During the period, Doral's shares
came under pressure after the company announced it would have to restate its
financial results for the past five years. However, at period-end, we still
owned a considerable stake in Doral as we believed the franchise remained
intact. Other holdings that negatively affected Fund performance were Fannie Mae
and iStar Financial. Fannie Mae declined amid allegations of questionable
accounting practices and possible regulatory changes. Real estate finance
company iStar Financial was hurt by its relatively slow growth rate.

Fund. We look forward to serving your future investment needs.

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY (CONTINUED)




ENDNOTES



INVESTING IN A NONDIVERSIFIED FUND CONCENTRATING IN THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR
INVOLVES SPECIAL RISKS SUCH AS DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE, AND
INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS
AFFECTING THE SECTOR. THE FUND'S INVESTMENTS IN SMALL- AND MEDIUM-CAPITALIZATION
STOCKS CARRY SPECIAL RISKS, SINCE THESE SECURITIES HAVE HISTORICALLY DISPLAYED
MORE PRICE VOLATILITY THAN LARGER-CAPITALIZATION STOCKS, PARTICULARLY OVER THE
SHORT TERM. THE FUND'S PROSPECTUS ALSO INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN
INVESTMENT RISKS.






CLASS A:         Prior to 8/3/98, these shares were offered at a lower initial
                 sales charge; thus actual total returns may differ.

CLASS B:         These shares have higher annual fees and expenses than Class A
                 shares.

CLASS C:         Prior to 1/1/04, these shares were offered with an initial
                 sales charge; thus actual total returns would have differed.
                 These shares have higher annual fees and expenses than Class A
                 shares.

ADVISOR CLASS:   Shares are available to certain eligible investors as described
                 in the prospectus.








(1)   Cumulative total return represents the change in value of an investment
over the periods indicated and does not include a sales charge.


(2)   Average annual total return represents the average annual change in value
of an investment over the periods indicated and includes any current,
applicable, maximum sales charge. Six-month return has not been
annualized.


(3)   These figures represent the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in
the Fund over the periods indicated and include any current, applicable,
maximum sales charge.


(4)   In accordance with SEC rules, we provide standardized average annual total
return information through the latest calendar quarter.


(5)   Effective 1/2/97, the Fund began offering Advisor Class shares, which do
not have sales charges or a Rule 12b-1 plan. Performance quotations for
this class reflect the following methods of calculation: (a) For periods
prior to 1/2/97, a restated figure is used based upon the Fund's Class A
performance, excluding the effect of Class A's maximum initial sales
charge, but reflecting the effect of the Class A Rule 12b-1 fees; and (b)
for periods after 1/1/97, actual Advisor Class performance is used
reflecting all charges and fees applicable to that class. Since 1/2/97
(commencement of sales), the cumulative and average annual total returns
of Advisor Class shares were +180.66% and +12.39%

YOUR FUND'S EXPENSES



As a Fund shareholder, you can incur two types of costs:


o     Transaction costs, including sales charges (loads) on Fund purchases and
redemption fees; and


o     Ongoing Fund costs, including management fees, distribution and service

(12b-1) fees, and other Fund expenses. All mutual funds have ongoing
costs, sometimes referred to as operating expenses.


The following table shows ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and can help
you understand these costs and compare them with those of other mutual funds.
The table assumes a $1,000 investment held for the six months indicated.



ACTUAL FUND EXPENSES



The first line (Actual) for each share class listed in the table below provides
actual account values and expenses. The "Ending Account Value" is derived from
the Fund's actual return, which includes the effect of Fund expenses


You can estimate the expenses you paid during the period, by following these
steps. OF COURSE, YOUR ACCOUNT VALUE AND EXPENSES WILL DIFFER FROM THOSE IN THIS
ILLUSTRATION:


1.    Divide your account value by $1,000.



IF AN ACCOUNT HAD AN $8,600 VALUE, THEN $8,600 / $1,000 = 8.6.



2.    Multiply the result by the number under the heading "Expenses Paid During
Period."



IF EXPENSES PAID DURING PERIOD WERE $7.50, THEN 8.6 X $7.50 = $64.50.



In this illustration, the estimated expenses paid this period are $64.50.



HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON WITH OTHER FUNDS



Information in the second line (Hypothetical) for each class in the table can
help you compare ongoing costs of investing in the Fund with those of other
mutual funds. This information may not be used to estimate the actual ending
account balance or expenses you paid during the period. The hypothetical "Ending
Account Value" is based on the actual expense ratio for each class and an
assumed 5% annual rate of return before expenses, which does not represent the
Fund's actual return. The figure under the heading "Expenses Paid During Period"
shows the hypothetical expenses your account would have incurred under this
scenario. You can compare this figure with the 5% hypothetical examples that
appear in shareholder reports of other funds.

YOUR FUND'S EXPENSES (CONTINUED)



PLEASE NOTE THAT EXPENSES SHOWN IN THE TABLE ARE MEANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONGOING
COSTS AND DO NOT REFLECT ANY TRANSACTION COSTS, SUCH AS SALES CHARGES OR
REDEMPTION FEES. Therefore, the second line for each class is useful in
comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you compare total costs of
owning different funds. In addition, if transaction costs were included, your
total costs would have been higher. Please refer to the Fund prospectus for
additional information on operating expenses.

FRANKLIN REAL ESTATE SECURITIES TRUST






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)




FRANKLIN REAL ESTATE SECURITIES FUND



1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


Franklin Real Estate Securities Trust (the Trust) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, open-end investment
company, consisting of one fund, the Franklin Real Estate Securites Fund (the
Fund).


The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.



A. SECURITIES VALUATION



Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.


Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.


The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:

fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)



B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION



Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.


The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.


Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.



C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS



When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.


The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.



D. INCOME TAXES



No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue
Code and to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income
and net realized gains.


Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation. Foreign
taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax regulations and rates that exist in
the foreign markets in which the Fund invests.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS



Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on
the ex-dividend date and are determined according to income tax regulations (tax
basis). Distributable earnings determined on a tax basis may differ from
earnings recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are
reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These
reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the results of operations.
Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they will reverse in subsequent
periods.


Distributions received by the Fund from securities may be a return of capital
(ROC). Such distributions reduce the cost basis of the securities, and any
distributions in excess of the cost basis are recognized as capital gains.


Realized and unrealized gains and losses and net investment income, other than
class specific expenses, are allocated daily to each class of shares based upon
the relative proportion of net assets of each class.



F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES



The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.



G. REDEMPTION FEES



A short term trading redemption fee will be imposed, with some exceptions, on
any Fund shares that are redeemed or exchanged within seven calendar days
following their purchase date. The redemption fee is 2% of the amount redeemed.
Such fees are retained by the Fund and accounted for as an addition to paid-in
capital.

H. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS



Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Trust against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Trust enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the
Trust expects the risk of loss to be remote.


2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST


The Fund offers four classes of shares: Class A, Class B, Class C, and Advisor
Class. Effective March 1, 2005, Class B shares are only offered to existing
Class B shareholders in the form of reinvested distributions and certain
exchanges from other Franklin Templeton Class B shares. Each class of shares
differs by its initial sales load, contingent deferred sales charges,
distribution fees, voting rights on matters affecting a single class and its
exchange privilege.


At October 31, 2005, there were an unlimited number of shares authorized ($.01
par value). Transactions in the Fund's shares were as follows:

placement transactions, and cannot be sold without prior registration under the

1933 Act. The Fund has registration rights for all restricted securities held at

if its valuation has not changed for a certain period of time. At October 31,
2005, the Fund held investments in restricted and illiquid securities, valued in
accordance with procedures approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees as
reflecting fair value, as follows:

10. REGULATORY MATTERS


As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, relating to certain practices in the
mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and marketing
support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin Resources,
Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), entered into
settlements with certain of those regulators.


Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") concerning market timing (the "August 2, 2004 SEC
Order") and marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund
shares (the "December 13, 2004 SEC Order") and with the California Attorney
General's Office ("CAGO") concerning marketing support payments to securities
dealers who sell fund shares (the "CAGO Settlement"). Under the terms of the
settlements with the SEC and the CAGO, the Company retained an Independent
Distribution Consultant ("IDC") to develop a plan for distribution of the
respective settlement monies. The CAGO approved the distribution plan under the
CAGO Settlement and, in accordance with the terms and conditions of that
settlement, the monies were disbursed to the relevant funds in March, 2005. The
SEC has not yet approved the distribution plan pertaining to the December 13,
2004 SEC Order. When approved, disbursements of settlement monies will be made
promptly to the relevant funds, in accordance with the terms and conditions of
that order. The IDC continues to develop the plan of distribution under the
August 2, 2004 SEC Order that resolved the SEC's market timing investigation.


In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, directors, and/or
employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as shareholder class
actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the named funds or
Franklin Resources, Inc.) relating to the industry practices referenced above,
as well as to allegedly excessive advisory fees, commisions, and/or 12b-1 fees.
The lawsuits were filed in different courts throughout the country. Many of
those suits are now pending in a multi-district litigation in the United States
District Court for the District of Maryland.


The Company and fund management strongly believe that the claims made in each of
the private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intend to defend
against them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual
outcome of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact
on the Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for
any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.


Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.


(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly

connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR.

Exhibit (a)(1)



CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS





PROCEDURES   Dated July 2004






FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS




CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND




SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS



I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code


This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:


o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
relationships;


o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;


o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;


o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
person or persons identified in the Code; and


o Accountability for adherence to the Code.


Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.


II.  Other Policies and Procedures


This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.


Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.


Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.


Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.


III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest


OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.


Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.


Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.


Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.



Each Covered Officer must:



o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
detriment of the FT Funds;


o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
benefit the FT Funds;


o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
that are made in good faith;


o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
relationships:/ 1


o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
required to file reports with the SEC;


o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
directors of the FT Funds;


o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
accountant); and


o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
affiliates of Franklin Resources).


These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.


There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:


o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;


o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
corporation or association


o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.


o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
thereof;




1 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by
completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.


2 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
Officer may also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.


o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
equity ownership.


Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.


IV. Disclosure and Compliance


o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;


o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;


o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and


o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
regulations.



V. Reporting and Accountability




Each Covered Officer must:



o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);


o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
requirements of the Code; and


o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
so is itself is a violation of this Code.


Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.




3 Franklin Resources General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized
to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.


4 Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.


The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:


o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
to the Legal Department;


o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
not required to take any further action;


o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
the appropriate FT Fund;


o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;


o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
appropriate; and


o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5


VI. Other Policies and Procedures


This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.


VII. Amendments


Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.


VIII. Confidentiality


All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.





5 See Part X.



IX. Internal Use


The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.



X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR




Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to


disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.


The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.


The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:


o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
annual report; and


o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
on Form N-CSR.


In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.


In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

            Strategy, Benefits, Results
        



            Strategy
        
The securities of REITs (real estate companies that purchase and usually manage properties such as office buildings, malls, apartments and hotels) are traded like stocks, which make them more liquid than individual properties.
We combine top-down macro analysis with bottom-up research of individual stocks to locate investment opportunities.
We seek to maximize total return by investing at least 80% of net assets in the equity securities of companies operating in the real estate industry—primarily Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).



            Benefits
        
Experienced Management. Our real estate team has been investing in real estate for more than 30 years.
Portfolio Diversification. Historically, real estate securities have had a relatively low correlation to both stocks and bonds, offering potential diversification benefits.

            Investing In The Fund
        

What Are the Risks?

All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
The fund concentrates in real estate securities which involve special risks, such as declines in the value of real estate and increased susceptibility to adverse economic or regulatory developments affecting the sector.
The fund’s investments in REITs involves additional risks; since REITs typically are invested in a limited number of projects or in a particular market segment they are more susceptible to adverse developments affecting a single project or market segment than more broadly diversified investments.
These and other risks are described more fully in the fund’s prospectus.

Source: Morningstar®. For each mutual fund and exchange traded fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in the same category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund's monthly performance, and does not take into account the effects of sales charges, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Morningstar Rating™ is for the named share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Past performance is not an indicator or a guarantee of future performance.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 230 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to maximize total return.




Strategy



Normally, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities of companies operating in the real estate industry predominantly in the United States, including: companies qualifying under federal tax law as real estate investment trusts (REITs); and companies that derive at least half of their assets or revenues from the ownership, construction, management, operation, development or sale of commercial or residential real estate (such as real estate operating or service companies, homebuilders, lodging providers, and developers).


Risk



Real Estate is a cyclical industry that is sensitive to interest rates, economic conditions (both nationally and locally), property tax rates, and other factors. Changes in real estate values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 05/01/1995.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 01/03/1994, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Real Estate is a cyclical industry that is sensitive to interest rates, economic conditions (both nationally and locally), property tax rates, and other factors. Changes in real estate values or economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the real estate industry. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Sector funds can be more volatile because of their narrow concentration in a specific industry. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower. Except for Life of Fund returns, the analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 5/1/1995.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 1/3/1994, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. The analysis on these pages may be based, in part, on adjusted historical returns for periods prior to the class's actual inception of 5/1/1995.  These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, with an inception date of 1/3/1994, adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of this share class (when this share class's fees and expenses are higher.)  Please refer to a fund's prospectus for information regarding fees and expenses.  These adjusted historical returns are not actual returns.  Calculation methodologies utilized by Morningstar may differ from those applied by other entities, including the fund itself.
9. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
