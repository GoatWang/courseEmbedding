						Expense Ratioas of 06/30/2017











Expense ratio details, Click here.

The net expense is based on estimates for the current fiscal year and takes into account contractual fee waivers/expense reimbursements that currently are scheduled to remain in place through 02/28/2018.  For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses.  Without such fee waivers/reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown include the reinvestment of all distributions. Returns shown at net asset value do not reflect the current maximum sales charge, had the sales charge been included, returns would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

SALES CHARGE REDUCTIONS AND WAIVERS
Please inform the fund company or your financial intermediary at the time of your purchase of fund shares if you believe you qualify for a reduced front-end sales charge.
Reducing Your Class A Share Front-End Sales Charge
 You may purchase Class A shares at a discount if you qualify under the circumstances outlined below. To receive a reduced front-end sales charge, you must let the fund or your financial intermediary know at the time of your purchase of fund shares that you believe you qualify for a discount. If you or a related party have holdings of eligible funds (as defined below) in other accounts with your financial intermediary or with other financial intermediaries that may be combined with your current purchases in determining the sales charge as described below, you must inform a fund or your financial intermediary. You may be asked to provide supporting account statements or other information to allow us or your financial intermediary to verify your eligibility for a discount. If you or your financial intermediary do not notify a fund or provide the requested information, you may not receive the reduced sales charge for which you otherwise qualify. Class A shares may be purchased at a discount if you qualify under either of the following conditions:

Rights of Accumulation - A purchaser may combine the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund currently owned with a new purchase of Class A shares of any eligible fund in order to reduce the sales charge on the new purchase. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes.
To the extent that your financial intermediary is able to do so, the value of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds determined for the purpose of reducing the sales charge of a new purchase under the Rights of Accumulation will be calculated at the higher of: 1) the aggregate current maximum offering price of your existing Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of eligible funds or 2) the aggregate amount you invested in such shares (including dividend reinvestments but excluding capital appreciation) less any withdrawals. You should retain any information and account records necessary to substantiate the historical amounts you and any related purchasers have invested in eligible funds. You must inform a fund and/or your financial intermediary at the time of purchase if you believe your purchase qualifies for a reduced sales charge; you may be requested to provide documentation of your holdings in order to verify your eligibility. If you do not do so, you may not receive all sales charge reductions for which you are eligible.

Letter of Intention — In order to reduce your Class A front-end sales charge, a purchaser may combine purchases of Class A, B, C, F, and P shares of any eligible fund the purchaser intends to make over the next 13 months in determining the applicable sales charge. The 13-month Letter of Intention period commences on the day that the Letter of Intention is received by a fund, and the purchaser must tell a fund that later purchases are subject to the Letter of Intention. Purchases submitted prior to the date the Letter of Intention is received by a fund are not counted toward the sales charge reduction. Current holdings under Rights of Accumulation may be included in a Letter of Intention in order to reduce the sales charge for purchases during the 13-month period covered by the Letter of Intention. Shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends or distributions are not included. Class I, R2, and R3 share holdings may not be combined for these purposes. Class A shares valued at 5% of the amount of intended purchases are escrowed and may be redeemed to cover the additional sales charges payable if the intended purchases under the Letter of Intention is not completed. The Letter of Intention is neither a binding obligation on you to buy nor on a fund to sell any or all of an intended purchase amount.

Purchaser — A purchaser includes: 1) an individual; 2) an individual, his or her spouse, and children under the age of 21; 3) retirement and benefit plans, including a 401(k) plan, profit-sharing plan, money purchase plan, defined benefit plan, and 457(b) plan sponsored by a governmental entity, nonprofit organization, school district, or church to which employer contributions are made, as well as SIMPLE IRA plans and SEP-IRA plans; or 4) a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing shares for a single trust, estate, or single fiduciary account. An individual may include under item (1) his or her holdings in eligible funds as described above in IRAs, as a sole participant of a retirement and benefit plan sponsored by the individual's business, and as a participant in a 403(b) plan to which only pretax salary deferrals are made. An individual and his or her spouse may include under item (2) their holdings in IRAs, and as the sole participants in retirement and benefit plans sponsored by a business owned by either or both of them. A retirement and benefit plan under item (3) includes all qualified retirement and benefit plans of a single employer and its consolidated subsidiaries, and all qualified retirement and benefit plans of multiple employers registered in the name of a single bank trustee.
Eligible fund — An eligible fund is any Lord Abbett-sponsored fund except for (1) each portfolio of Lord Abbett Series Fund, Inc., (2) Lord Abbett U.S. Government & Government Sponsored Enterprises Money Market Fund, Inc. ("Money Market Fund") (except for holdings in Money Market Fund, which are attributable to any shares exchanged from the Lord Abbett-sponsored funds), and (3) any other fund the shares of which are not available to the investor at the time of the transaction due to a limitation on the offering of a fund's shares.
Front-end Sales Charge Waivers
 Class A shares may be purchased without a front-end sales charge under any of the following conditions:

purchases of $1 million or more (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases by retirement and benefit plans with at least 100 eligible employees (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases for retirement and benefit plans made through financial intermediaries that perform participant recordkeeping or other administrative services for the plans and that have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases (may be subject to a CDSC);
purchases made by or on behalf of financial intermediaries for clients that pay the financial intermediaries fees in connection with fee-based advisory program, provided that the financial intermediaries or their trading agents have entered into special arrangements with a fund and/or Lord Abbett Distributor specifically for such purchases; and
certain other types of investors may qualify to purchase Class A share without a front-end sales charge as described in the Statement of Additional Information (SAI).

Expense ratio details, Click here.

The net expense is based on estimates for the current fiscal year and takes into account contractual fee waivers/expense reimbursements that currently are scheduled to remain in place through 02/28/2018.  For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses.  Without such fee waivers/reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
 




headingView Disclosure




New Fund Risk: The Fund is newly organized. There can be no assurance that the Fund will reach or maintain a sufficient asset size to effectively implement its investing strategy.







headingView Disclosure




A Note about Risk: The value of investments in equity securities will fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and to changes in the prospects of particular companies and/or sectors in the economy. The foreign securities in which the Fund primarily invests generally pose greater risks than domestic securities, including greater price fluctuations and higher transaction costs. Foreign investments also may be affected by changes in currency rates or currency controls. With respect to certain foreign countries, there is a possibility of nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition of withholding or other taxes, and political or social instability that could affect investments in those countries. These risks can be greater in the case of emerging country securities. Investments in either growth or value stocks may shift in and out of favor for long periods of time, depending on market and economic conditions. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with derivatives, which may be different from and greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other investments. The Fund may invest in exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), investments in ETFs are subject to a variety of risks, including the risks associated with a direct investment in the underlying securities that the ETF holds. 







 
Performance data quoted is historical. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain performance data current to the most recent quarter-end, go to quarter ending performance on our Website or call Lord Abbett at (888) 522-2388.
 



Class A  Except as noted below, returns with sales charges reflect a maximum sales charge of 5.75% for equity funds, 2.25% for all tax-free income funds, fixed income funds and multi-asset class funds. There are also ongoing 12b-1 service fees (and, in certain cases, distribution fees).
Class A Shares purchased subject to a front-end sales charge have no contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC). However, certain purchases of Class A shares made without a front-end sales charge may be subject to a CDSC of 1% if the shares are redeemed before the first day of the month in which the one year anniversary of the purchase falls. The CDSC is not reflected in the performance with maximum sales charge.



With Sales Charge - Returns with sales charges reflect applicable fees and expenses and include all distributions reinvested.
 
 




Without Sales Charge - Returns shown are without sales charges and have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
 




Returns shown at less than a year reflect aggregate total returns.
 




Double-Digit Returns - instances of high double-digit returns were achieved primarily during favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable over time.

Fund Expense Ratio Detail: Reflects expenses for the Fund's fiscal year-end and is subject to change. Fund expenses may fluctuate with market volatility. A substantial reduction in Fund assets (since its most recently completed fiscal year), whether caused by market conditions or significant redemptions or both, will likely cause total operating expenses (as a percentage of Fund assets) to become higher than those shown.

The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown at net asset value have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

With one more downgrade, Illinois’s general obligation bonds could become the first junk-rated debt of any state since 1970. But default risk still remains low.

Description[edit]
Lord Abbett is a privately owned, limited liability company with 64 active partners (as of March 31, 2017). Managing Partner Daria L. Foster leads the firm and is responsible for setting strategic direction and business management. Robert A. Lee, Partner and Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for directing the portfolio management, research, and trading activities for the firm’s equity and fixed-income strategies. Lee assumed the role of CIO on July 1, 2016, after former CIO Robert I. Gerber retired. [2]
The firm focuses solely on actively managed investment portfolios. Lord Abbett’s strategies are available within separate and sub-advised accounts, commingled and mutual funds, and managed account platforms.[3][4]
History[edit]
On November 18, 1929, several weeks after the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, Andrew James Lord and his associates created Lord, Westerfield & Co., Inc., with headquarters at 68 William Street, a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1931, the Westerfields resigned from the company. Leon Abbett, a member of the founding group and the son of a former two-time New Jersey governor and state Supreme Court justice, provided the capital contribution that enabled the firm to continue. Two years later, the name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co.[5]
In 1932, Lord created an investment trust, American Business Shares, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched.[6]
Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms. Citation:.[7]
In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of fixed−income securities. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client.[8]
In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. Managing Partner Bob Dow (who had managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007. Daria Foster, who succeeded Dow in 2007, continued to diversify the company’s fund offerings, lowered costs and fees for many of the funds, and expanded the distribution channels that sell the funds.[9]
In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where it would stay for the next decade. In 2000, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey.
As of March 31, 2017, Lord Abbett managed $143.5 billion in assets, which includes about $1.7 billion for which Lord Abbett provided investment models to managed account sponsors.
International Products[edit]
In May 2014, Lord Abbett launched a suite of UCITS [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities] funds to provide non-U.S. institutions and non-U.S. resident investors with access to select Lord Abbett investment strategies. The funds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.[10]

With one more downgrade, Illinois’s general obligation bonds could become the first junk-rated debt of any state since 1970. But default risk still remains low.

Description[edit]
Lord Abbett is a privately owned, limited liability company with 64 active partners (as of March 31, 2017). Managing Partner Daria L. Foster leads the firm and is responsible for setting strategic direction and business management. Robert A. Lee, Partner and Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for directing the portfolio management, research, and trading activities for the firm’s equity and fixed-income strategies. Lee assumed the role of CIO on July 1, 2016, after former CIO Robert I. Gerber retired. [2]
The firm focuses solely on actively managed investment portfolios. Lord Abbett’s strategies are available within separate and sub-advised accounts, commingled and mutual funds, and managed account platforms.[3][4]
History[edit]
On November 18, 1929, several weeks after the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, Andrew James Lord and his associates created Lord, Westerfield & Co., Inc., with headquarters at 68 William Street, a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1931, the Westerfields resigned from the company. Leon Abbett, a member of the founding group and the son of a former two-time New Jersey governor and state Supreme Court justice, provided the capital contribution that enabled the firm to continue. Two years later, the name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co.[5]
In 1932, Lord created an investment trust, American Business Shares, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched.[6]
Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms. Citation:.[7]
In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of fixed−income securities. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client.[8]
In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. Managing Partner Bob Dow (who had managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007. Daria Foster, who succeeded Dow in 2007, continued to diversify the company’s fund offerings, lowered costs and fees for many of the funds, and expanded the distribution channels that sell the funds.[9]
In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where it would stay for the next decade. In 2000, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey.
As of March 31, 2017, Lord Abbett managed $143.5 billion in assets, which includes about $1.7 billion for which Lord Abbett provided investment models to managed account sponsors.
International Products[edit]
In May 2014, Lord Abbett launched a suite of UCITS [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities] funds to provide non-U.S. institutions and non-U.S. resident investors with access to select Lord Abbett investment strategies. The funds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.[10]

Description[edit]
Lord Abbett is a privately owned, limited liability company with 64 active partners (as of March 31, 2017). Managing Partner Daria L. Foster leads the firm and is responsible for setting strategic direction and business management. Robert A. Lee, Partner and Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for directing the portfolio management, research, and trading activities for the firm’s equity and fixed-income strategies. Lee assumed the role of CIO on July 1, 2016, after former CIO Robert I. Gerber retired. [2]
The firm focuses solely on actively managed investment portfolios. Lord Abbett’s strategies are available within separate and sub-advised accounts, commingled and mutual funds, and managed account platforms.[3][4]
History[edit]
On November 18, 1929, several weeks after the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, Andrew James Lord and his associates created Lord, Westerfield & Co., Inc., with headquarters at 68 William Street, a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1931, the Westerfields resigned from the company. Leon Abbett, a member of the founding group and the son of a former two-time New Jersey governor and state Supreme Court justice, provided the capital contribution that enabled the firm to continue. Two years later, the name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co.[5]
In 1932, Lord created an investment trust, American Business Shares, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched.[6]
Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms. Citation:.[7]
In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of fixed−income securities. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client.[8]
In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. Managing Partner Bob Dow (who had managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007. Daria Foster, who succeeded Dow in 2007, continued to diversify the company’s fund offerings, lowered costs and fees for many of the funds, and expanded the distribution channels that sell the funds.[9]
In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where it would stay for the next decade. In 2000, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey.
As of March 31, 2017, Lord Abbett managed $143.5 billion in assets, which includes about $1.7 billion for which Lord Abbett provided investment models to managed account sponsors.
International Products[edit]
In May 2014, Lord Abbett launched a suite of UCITS [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities] funds to provide non-U.S. institutions and non-U.S. resident investors with access to select Lord Abbett investment strategies. The funds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.[10]
