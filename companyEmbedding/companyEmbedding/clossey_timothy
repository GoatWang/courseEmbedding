A test program was undertaken to demonstrate that a realistic gasoline could reduce both hydrocarbon mass and reactivity of vehicle exhaust emissions and simultaneously reduce toxics, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide emissions. In order to evaluate the effect of RVP and aromatics, four highly reformulated gasolines were blended from existing refinery streams with RVP at a nominal 8 and 7 psi and aromatics at a nominal20 and 10 vol%. The emissions performance of these fuels were measured in a fleet of ten 1990 California vehicles. When compared to industry average gasoline, each of the four gasoline test blends demonstrated substantial emission reductions in criteria pollutants and toxics. Estimates of the cost and emission benefit of these gasolines were used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these formulations for California.

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Par Petroleum Corporation (OTCQB:PARR) today announced the appointment 
      of Melvyn N. Klein, Curt Anastasio, Timothy Clossey and Robert Silberman 
      to the Board of Directors. Resigning from the Board were Michael Keener 
      and Benjamin Lurie. These changes expand the Board to seven, six of whom

      “We are excited about the new additions to the Board of Directors and 
      would like to express our gratitude to Mike and Ben for their 
      contributions to Par’s early growth,” said William Monteleone, Chairman 
      and Chief Executive Officer of Par Petroleum Corporation. “The new Board 
      brings a wealth of experience in both the building and managing of 
      public companies, as well as significant downstream knowledge.”

      management team. I am further pleased to extend my 40-year business 
      relationship with Sam Zell, the General Partner of Par’s largest 
      shareholder. This has included working together on Anixter International 
      (NYSE:AXE) since the time approximately 30 years ago that Sam invited me 
      to join him on its Board of Directors and Executive Committee; 
      shareholder value creation at Anixter is a matter of public record.
    

      “The other three new members of Par’s board are exceptionally able 
      people with extensive, proven experience in Par’s areas of focus and
