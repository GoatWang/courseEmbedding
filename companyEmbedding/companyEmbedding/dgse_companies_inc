History[edit]
Originally known as American Pacific Mint Inc., they incorporated in Nevada in September 1965, and later moved to Azusa, California.[3][4] They purchased the Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange in September 1987 for an undisclosed amount. Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange continued operating as a subsidiary of American Pacific Mint. In January 1992, after seeing that subsidiary achieve record results and a 19% jump in profits, American Pacific Mint announced their plan to move their headquarters to Dallas and rename the entire company as Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange.[5] Shareholders approved the plan in July that year.[6] In July 2001, they began to use their present name.[7]
They were one of the earliest coin and bullion dealers to begin doing business on the internet; they set up a website to auction jewelry from their stores in 1995, and later launched two further websites for auctioning watches and to allow jewelry manufactures and vendors to sell to each other and directly to the public. They also set up a website to provide real-time price quotes for precious metals.[1] Their revenues from their internet business began to show dramatic growth in 1999; revenue to March 15 of that year was five times the revenue for their 1998 fiscal year.[8] Their acquisition of Superior Galleries, and the success of Superior's first auction under DGSE ownership, drove their share price up 33% to $4.06 in August 2007.[9]
DGSE operates thirty five retail locations: eight Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange stores throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex; Bullion Express in Highland Park (Chicago), IL; Charleston Gold & Diamond Exchange in Charleston, SC; and 24 stores, branded as Southern Bullion Coin & Jewelry throughout the Southeast U.S., including Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia.
In April 2012 DGSE Announces Halt in Trading of its public stock on AMEX [10]
In June 2012, DGSE closes its Superior Gold and Silver Exchange store in Woodland Hills.[11]
In July 2012, DGSE opens two new stores in Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex: Southlake, TX and Allen, TX.
In November 2012, DGSE opened a new store in Fort Worth, TX [12]
In November 2012, DGSE Companies Announces the Resumption of Trading of its public stock on NYSE MKT.[13]

History[edit]
Originally known as American Pacific Mint Inc., they incorporated in Nevada in September 1965, and later moved to Azusa, California.[3][4] They purchased the Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange in September 1987 for an undisclosed amount. Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange continued operating as a subsidiary of American Pacific Mint. In January 1992, after seeing that subsidiary achieve record results and a 19% jump in profits, American Pacific Mint announced their plan to move their headquarters to Dallas and rename the entire company as Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange.[5] Shareholders approved the plan in July that year.[6] In July 2001, they began to use their present name.[7]
They were one of the earliest coin and bullion dealers to begin doing business on the internet; they set up a website to auction jewelry from their stores in 1995, and later launched two further websites for auctioning watches and to allow jewelry manufactures and vendors to sell to each other and directly to the public. They also set up a website to provide real-time price quotes for precious metals.[1] Their revenues from their internet business began to show dramatic growth in 1999; revenue to March 15 of that year was five times the revenue for their 1998 fiscal year.[8] Their acquisition of Superior Galleries, and the success of Superior's first auction under DGSE ownership, drove their share price up 33% to $4.06 in August 2007.[9]
DGSE operates thirty five retail locations: eight Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange stores throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex; Bullion Express in Highland Park (Chicago), IL; Charleston Gold & Diamond Exchange in Charleston, SC; and 24 stores, branded as Southern Bullion Coin & Jewelry throughout the Southeast U.S., including Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia.
In April 2012 DGSE Announces Halt in Trading of its public stock on AMEX [10]
In June 2012, DGSE closes its Superior Gold and Silver Exchange store in Woodland Hills.[11]
In July 2012, DGSE opens two new stores in Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex: Southlake, TX and Allen, TX.
In November 2012, DGSE opened a new store in Fort Worth, TX [12]
In November 2012, DGSE Companies Announces the Resumption of Trading of its public stock on NYSE MKT.[13]

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS. Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online and the information providers herein make no claims concerning the validity of the information provided hereby and will not be held liable for any use of this information.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please   
    click here.

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.

History[edit]
Originally known as American Pacific Mint Inc., they incorporated in Nevada in September 1965, and later moved to Azusa, California.[3][4] They purchased the Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange in September 1987 for an undisclosed amount. Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange continued operating as a subsidiary of American Pacific Mint. In January 1992, after seeing that subsidiary achieve record results and a 19% jump in profits, American Pacific Mint announced their plan to move their headquarters to Dallas and rename the entire company as Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange.[5] Shareholders approved the plan in July that year.[6] In July 2001, they began to use their present name.[7]
They were one of the earliest coin and bullion dealers to begin doing business on the internet; they set up a website to auction jewelry from their stores in 1995, and later launched two further websites for auctioning watches and to allow jewelry manufactures and vendors to sell to each other and directly to the public. They also set up a website to provide real-time price quotes for precious metals.[1] Their revenues from their internet business began to show dramatic growth in 1999; revenue to March 15 of that year was five times the revenue for their 1998 fiscal year.[8] Their acquisition of Superior Galleries, and the success of Superior's first auction under DGSE ownership, drove their share price up 33% to $4.06 in August 2007.[9]
DGSE operates thirty five retail locations: eight Dallas Gold and Silver Exchange stores throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex; Bullion Express in Highland Park (Chicago), IL; Charleston Gold & Diamond Exchange in Charleston, SC; and 24 stores, branded as Southern Bullion Coin & Jewelry throughout the Southeast U.S., including Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Georgia.
In April 2012 DGSE Announces Halt in Trading of its public stock on AMEX [10]
In June 2012, DGSE closes its Superior Gold and Silver Exchange store in Woodland Hills.[11]
In July 2012, DGSE opens two new stores in Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex: Southlake, TX and Allen, TX.
In November 2012, DGSE opened a new store in Fort Worth, TX [12]
In November 2012, DGSE Companies Announces the Resumption of Trading of its public stock on NYSE MKT.[13]

WhistleBlower Policy & Form




                    
		   
		   DGSE Companies, Inc. is committed to promoting ethical and honest behavior and ensuring 
		   that our co-workers, suppliers, vendors and partners feel safe and secure in their work 
		   environment. In support of this commitment, we operate an anonymous Whistleblower Service 
		   through a toll free number (800-916-7037) to facilitate reporting by co-workers and others 
		   of potential misconduct in the workplace, including:
		   Theft
Harassment
Fraud
Unethical/illegal behavior
Dishonesty
Workplace safety hazards
Discrimination
		   DGSE’s Whistleblower Policy ensures that, in line with regulatory requirements, co-workers 
		   can raise concerns regarding alleged inappropriate conduct in good faith. Each concern raised 
		   is properly investigated without the subject or reporting party being subjected to harassment 
		   or discriminatory treatment.
		   Whistleblower matters are reported to the Board of Directors immediately upon receipt.

                
                    
            








Process:




Receipt of Complaints –





	                    The Board of Directors will be involved in the treatment of these complaints, 
	                    led by at least one independent Board member.
	                    




Employees:





	                    Complaints may be submitted regarding an individual’s respective concern about 
	                    possible corporate misconduct in the workplace. These concerns are treated in a 
	                    confidential, anonymous basis through our toll-free Whistleblower hotline.
	                    
Non-employees:



		     Includes any business that engages, in whole or in part, in
		     the manufacturing, wholesale or retail sale of jewelry or any other aspect of the
		     company's business.
                    




Treatment of Complaints:



                   The treatment of all complaints will be subject to the oversight of the Board of Directors.
		   Upon receipt of a complaint regarding any matter, the Lead Independent Director will 
		   evaluate the complaint, discuss the complaint with the chief executive officer if appropriate, 
		   and determine if the complaint should be forwarded to all independent directors. Once reviewed, 
		   the Board of Directors, senior management and legal counsel, if appropriate, will determine a 
		   recommended course of action. This may include an investigation conducted with the involvement 
		   of an independent committee or group to assist in the investigation into the complaint. Once
		   completed, the company’s Lead Independent Director will report his recommendation.
		   Prompt and appropriate corrective action will be taken in response to all complaints as warranted
		   in the judgment of the Board of Directors. Individual’s confidentiality will be maintained to the 
		   extent reasonably possible throughout the course of all such investigations.
		   DGSE will not terminate, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any manner discriminate or 
		   retaliate against any employee in the terms and conditions of employment based upon any lawful 
		   actions of such employee with respect to good faith reporting of complaints regarding any possible 
		   corporate misconduct, nor take any other action prohibited by Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
		   Act of 2002.
                    


Retention of Complaints:



                  The Company’s Secretary will maintain a log of all complaints. The log will note the receipt, 
                  investigation, and resolution of each complaint. Copies of the complaints will be retained for five years 
                  following the termination of the course of action taken in response any allegations.

DGSE Companies, Inc. Announces Letter Of Intent For Accretive Acquisition Of Pawn Businesses






Business Wire




Jul 6, 2017 4:01 PM EDT













 




























































  DGSE Companies, Inc. (NYSE MKT:DGSE) ("DGSE" or the "Company"), a leading wholesaler and retailer of jewelry, diamonds, fine watches, and precious metal bullion and rare coin products, today announced that it has entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent to acquire the equity interests in National Pawn, Inc. ("National") and its related affiliates. No definitive agreement has been reached, and there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be reached. DGSE's Board of Directors' approval is required in order to enter into such definitive agreement.  If a definitive agreement is reached, this acquisition would be expected to close in the 3 rd quarter of 2017. DGSE expects the acquisition to bring promising revenue and earnings accretion to shareholders going forward.  National and its affiliates have a 27-store footprint, including stores in Arizona, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas. National is based in Austin, Texas. It was founded in 1993 by its current CEO, Courtland (Corky) L. Logue, Jr. ("Logue"). Logue has a long history in founding and operating pawnshops, including EZPAWN and EZCORP (NASDAQ: EZPW).  "We continue to explore new opportunities and agreements with potential partners who are excited about being a part of DGSE's future. We believe this positions DGSE to generate an attractive, total shareholder return over the long term," stated John Loftus, DGSE's President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  Elemetal Recycling Update.  As announced on April 19, 2017, DGSE has also entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent to acquire certain tangible personal-property assets of Elemetal Recycling, LLC from Elemetal, LLC. This transaction is progressing well, with DGSE working to complete requisite due diligence, financing and a definitive agreement.  Profits and Retail-Operations Update.  DGSE expects to post a profit in the second quarter of 2017 and show continued operational improvement, though there is still much to be done to build the business to its full potential and maximize shareholder value. DGSE anticipates getting smarter with each customer interaction, educating its sales staff on customers' preferred products.

Announces Letter of Intent to Acquire Elemetal Recycling, LLC AssetsBusiness WireApril 19, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DGSE Companies, Inc. (NYSE MKT:DGSE) (“DGSE” or the “Company”), a leading wholesaler and retailer of jewelry, diamonds, fine watches, and precious metal bullion and rare coin products, today announced that it has entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent with Elemetal, LLC (“Elemetal”) to acquire the tangible personal-property assets of Elemetal and Elemetal Recycling, LLC (“Recycling”) at 2101 W. Belt Line Road, Carrollton, Texas, the equipment at 10707 Composite Drive, Dallas, and certain accounts receivable of Recycling. The total estimated cash proceeds to Elemetal and Recycling from the sale and from the payment by DGSE of approximately $3.8 million of obligations owed by DGSE to Elemetal is $19.8 million. In addition, DGSE would assume certain accounts payable of Recycling.No definitive agreement has been reached, and there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be reached. DGSE Board of Directors approval would be required for such definitive agreement.“DGSE seeks to acquire diversified business opportunities with potential long-term rewards, and this Recycling acquisition holds great promise in working toward that strategic goal,” stated John Loftus, DGSE’s President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.“Recycling is a de-manufacturer and refurbishment processor of electronics in the aftermarket supply chain. It operates principally from a 175,000 square-foot facility in Carrollton, Texas that is designed to process precious-metal-bearing products from a host of industries. Recycling conforms to ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001:2004 and R2 practices, which we believe makes it a top choice for disposing of IT and electronics assets,” said Loftus.Elemetal currently holds an approximately 49% interest in DGSE.DGSE Companies, Inc. wholesales and retails jewelry, diamonds, fine watches, and precious metal bullion and rare coin products through its Charleston Gold & Diamond Exchange and Dallas Gold & Silver Exchange operations. DGSE also owns Fairchild International, Inc., one of the largest vintage watch wholesalers in the country. In addition to its retail facilities in South Carolina and Texas, the Company operates websites which can be accessed at www.dgse.com, and www.cgdeinc.com. Real-time price quotations and real-time order execution in precious metals are provided on another DGSE website at www.USBullionExchange.com. Wholesale customers can access the full vintage watch inventory through the restricted site at www.FairchildWatches.com. The Company is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and its common stock trades on the NYSE MKT exchange under the symbol “DGSE.”This press release includes statements that may constitute “forward-looking” statements, including statements regarding the potential acquisition of Recycling and entering into a definitive agreement regarding the potential acquisition. These statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Factors that would cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, negotiations regarding a definitive agreement, market conditions, and other risks detailed in the Company's periodic report filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. By making these forward-looking statements, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this release except as required by law.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170419006724/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextS&P 500 and Nasdaq close lower after tech's reversal from record highsCNBCZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredProfit-Taking in Tech Pushes Nasdaq From Record HeightsInvestorPlaceCenturyLink CEO to employees: 'We are not perfect,' 'keep your spirits up'Denver Business JournalComplacency Is Setting In for Investors and the MarketsInvestorPlaceThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredStocks jump to new all-time highs as Boeing earnings boost DowYahoo FinanceSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredMattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted transgender ban, and he was reportedly 'appalled' by itBusiness InsiderTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoGDP — What you need to know in markets on FridayYahoo FinanceDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredAmazon wobble ripples across world stock marketsReutersWhite House comms director Scaramucci: 'I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own c--k'Business InsiderHow Local Law Enforcement Leaders and Anti-Immigration Groups Have Joined Forces to Deport More Undocumented ImmigrantsCharles: This is great news.
