5 Ways to Help Prevent Your Car From Getting Stolen | GEICO















































 




GEICO Moregeico.com homepageHome / Driving / Auto / Car Safety & Insurance / Hands Off My Ride: 5 Ways To Prevent Car TheftHands Off My Ride: 5 Ways To Prevent Car Theft
July 17, 2017 1 Comment When it comes to preventing car theft, knowledge is power. Fortunately, we have plenty of tip and tricks to help you outsmart thieves and minimize the risk of them stealing your wheels.
First things first, though. You should be aware if you live in a region prone to auto theft. Each year, the National Insurance Crime Bureau releases its “Hot Spots” report, listing the 10 areas with the highest per capita vehicle theft rate. In the 2016 report (published in June, 2017), Albuquerque, N.M., topped the list with 10,011 reported thefts, while six of the top 10 spots are in California. Overall, vehicle theft is up 6.6 percent across the nation.
Read on for ways you can protect your ride—and yourself—no matter where the road takes you.
Lock The Doors!
It may seem obvious, but locking your car is the simplest way to keep it safe. A recent trend shows that a staggering number of thefts occur because the keys or fob were left inside, dangling in plain sight: In 2015, a whopping 57,096 cars were stolen with the keys or fob in the car, a 22 percent increase over the previous year, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). This translates to a car being swiped every six-and-a-half minutes.
Park Smart
State departments of motor vehicles recommend parking in well-lit locations. Choose spaces with not just plenty of light, but also plenty of traffic and passersby who are likely to see and report activity around your ride. For overnight parking, avoid low-security lots altogether.
Stash Your Stuff
Always take your garage door opener and valuables with you, even if it’s slightly inconvenient. Keep your vehicle registration in your wallet or purse. Don’t leave it in the car, in case your vehicle does end up getting stolen.
Never Leave It Running
Even if you’re just jumping out for a minute, it’s safer—and more fuel-efficient—to completely turn off the engine.
Keep An Eye Out
Pay attention to your surroundings when you get out of your car. Being distracted or hurried can leave you vulnerable and forgetful (like remembering to lock your doors). “Complacency can lead to a huge financial loss and inconvenience for the vehicle owner,” said NICB president and CEO Joe Wehrle in a press release. “Leaving a vehicle unlocked or with the key or fob inside gives a thief the opportunity to take not only the car, but also any possessions inside.”
To further protect your vehicle, get a fast, free, and personalized auto insurance quote from GEICO to see how much you could save.

Another good way to prevent theft – drive a stick shift vehicle.
Most people cannot drive a standard transmission vehicle;
Thus, most looking for a car to swipe  will pass it by

A.M. Best Upgrades Credit Ratings of Palisades Safety and Insurance Association and Its Subsidiaries










[July 13, 2017]


A.M. Best Upgrades Credit Ratings of Palisades Safety and Insurance Association and Its Subsidiaries







A.M. Best has upgraded the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) to B++ 
 (Good) from B+ (Good) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term 
 ICR) to "bbb" from "bbb-" for the members of Palisades Group 
 (Palisades) (Berkeley Heights, NJ) and the members of High Point 
 Homeowners Group (High Point) (Red Bank, NJ). These entities are all 
 operating subsidiaries of their parent company, Palisades Safety and 
 Insurance Association. The outlooks of these Credit Ratings 
 (ratings) have been revised to stable from positive. (See below for a 
 detailed listing of the companies.)
 

 The rating upgrades reflect Palisades and High Point's improved 
 underwriting and operating performance in recent years, which has led to 
 improved risk-adjusted capitalization. The core books of business have 
 shown improvement in performance as a result of underwriting discipline 
 and rate actions. The groups also have benefited from milder weather 
 patterns in recent years.
 

 The rating affirmations reflect each group's adequate risk-adjusted 
 capitalization, as well as management's extensive experience and 
 expertise in the New Jersey automobile and homeowners' insurance 
 markets. The groups utilize several distribution channels to produce 
 business and maintain their market share in New Jersey's competitive and 
 challenging insurance market. Conversely, as single state writers, 
 Palisades and High Point remain susceptible to frequent and severe 
 localized weather and to economic, judicial and regulatory issues.
 

 The FSR has been upgraded to B++ (Good) from B+ (Good) and the Long-Term 
 ICRs have been upgraded to "bbb" from "bbb-", with the outlook revised 
 to stable from positive for the following members of the Palisades 
Group:
 





Palisades Safety and Insurance Association


Palisades Insurance Company


High Point Property and Casualty Insurance Company


High Point Safety and Insurance Company


Twin (News - Alert) Lights Insurance Company


Teachers Auto Insurance Company of New Jersey



 The FSR has been upgraded to B++ (Good) from B+ (Good) and the Long-Term 
 ICRs have been upgraded to "bbb" from "bbb-", with the outlook revised 
 to stable from positive for the following members of the High Point 
 Homeowners Group:
 


High Point Preferred Insurance Company


Palisades Property and Casualty Insurance Company

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.







this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.







Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. 

Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.

They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.

I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.







What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.







One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.







Miserable experience!  Short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone.







Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. 
Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?







Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.







I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.







Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!







Who woulda thunk it? "Hmmm...let me check the reviews on this insurance place, because I HAVE to have insurance!"
Going with Safety is a gamble! The house always wins.







Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...

On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.

Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.

For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age.

"We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.

But then it gets better ...

I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  

Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.

The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. 

So to sum up, here's how it goes:
1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.
2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.
3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.
4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.

Their business policies are questionable, at best.







I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!







Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. 

A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. 

They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! 

Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  

Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.

Well done Safety. And THANKS!







I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.

Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.







Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.







Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.

Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.

I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.

I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. 

When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.

Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.

The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. 

They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.







If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.







My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.







I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.

Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.

What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.

One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.

Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?

Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.

I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.

Updated review










            Listed in Adventures In My Car...


Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age."We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.But then it gets better ...I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. So to sum up, here's how it goes:1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.Their business policies are questionable, at best.

Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again... unfortunately, as an insurance company, I don't call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are, I call you when there's a problem.  And just as I expected and as history repeats itself, you weren't there.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.On a sunny Saturday afternoon, cruising down 128 with my dog buckled in the backseat, we were behind a truck and like a slow-motion movie, the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out.  There were three no-win options:  swerve and cause an accident, slam on the brakes and cause an accident, or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best.  With a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with Safety after being the one being rear-ended, I plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield.  Not sure what to do, I got off at the next exit and called Safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible.  Since it was a glass-only claim, this is what I received:"Oh we're sorry, you will have to call back during normal business hours.  Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, from 8am to 5pm."Say what?  So, bottom line is this ... there is no 24/7 service with Safety.  Yes, it is an auto insurance company, but if you are in an accident or if you need help, they are only available during normal business hours which, statistically speaking, is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help.  Like I said, you don't call an auto insurance company just to say hi, see how things are going, and to shoot the breeze.  No, you call them when there is an emergency and you need help.Phone calls went unreturned.Emails went unanswered.Another scathing Facebook post and tweet.To sum it up, I took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired.  With a snowstorm looming in the forecast, it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and that's just what I did.  For the longest time, I told my husband I was done with Safety Insurance, and now I mean it.Safety Insurance, we are breaking up.  Your crappy customer service, your shitty hours, and your incompetent agents just aren't cutting it anymore.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.

We have Safety Insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance.  Unfortunately, we have had to file claims under both policies.  In 2009, our homeowner's claim was to cover damage from a storm.  The claim representative was very polite, compassionate, and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week.  The house was fixed, we were happy, and life went on.  That experience is the only reason why this is a 2-star review.Safety Insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance.  With a great credit score, a perfect driving record, and a newer vehicle, they offered me a great deal and I signed on.  All was good until I was rear-ended on my way to work one morning.  My phone call to Safety Insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with "Sorry, we don't have any claims representatives right now.  But you can leave a message."  At that point, I should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car, back up, and plow right through me.  Because had I known what I know now, getting hit again by a 1996 Chevy Astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with Safety.  When the Butterball Turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company, you know you're in trouble.As an educated individual, I know that insurance companies really don't care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident.  They want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you don't lawyer-up.  Insurance companies make money.  That is their business.As a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company, I was treated as if I was a felon.  Phone calls went unanswered.  Emails were transferred to clueless representatives.  "We'll get back to you."  Yeah right, and the checks are in the mail.  The accident was in September 2012 and it wasn't resolved until May 2013.  That's 8 months!  It wasn't until I left a scathing Facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me.  In conclusion:  yes, their rates as a good driver are very competitive.  However, Safety Insurance is only good until you need them.  Claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude.  Even as the "victim" your only effective way of getting compensated for your out-of-pocket costs from an accident are to lawyer-up.I can think of a million other things I'd rather do than have to call Safety Insurance when there is an emergency and I need help.  In fact, I'm fairly positive I'd get more help from an ex-boyfriend that I broke up with via a text-message than the help I got from Safety.

I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!

Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.Well done Safety. And THANKS!

I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.

Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.

Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.

My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.

I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

It also offers an array other services including property and casualty insurance products, including commercial automobile, homeowners, dwelling fire, umbrella, and business owner policies.

The IT department for Safety Insurance Group is located at its corporate headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. The department is largely focused on enterprise applications and relationship management with the company's outsourcing provider.

 The day-to-day operations of the department are handled by the Management Information Systems group, which oversees hardware and software upgrades and programming. 

Several smaller teams within the MIS group are responsible for web development. There are also teams dedicated to business systems and project management. 

In May of 2012, Safety signed an outsourcing agreement with CSC to extend its managed services agreement through 2021. This agreement upgrades Safety's Exceed Billing system, and moves all of the company's business to onto a new Java-based platform.

Safety is implementing a limited BYOD program. The company is using several measures to keep the information secure, including a service that wipes emails clean if the device is lost or stolen. Currently, it will not provide Wi-Fi to its employees' devices.

How do I report a claim?


Claims must be reported as soon as reasonably possible.  Please contact us by mail, email, or fax.  
Medmarc Insurance GroupAttn: Claims Reporting14280 Park Meadow Drive, Suite 300Chantilly, Virginia 20151
Email:  ClaimsReporting@Medmarc.com
Fax: (703) 652-1389
If you have questions about whether to report a claim, please refer to your policy, which includes requirements for reporting occurrences, claims, and lawsuits.  Medmarc's claims staff are also available to answer your questions and provide reporting advice.
Please contact our Claims Department at (800) 356-6886.


How do I access my loss information?


You can request a loss run via our Loss Run Request page. Please select “Loss Run Request” in the subject line and submit dates and name of insured in the additional information box.  You must be the Insured or the current Broker of Record to make this request.  You will receive your loss run report within one business day of request. 
Online loss run access is temporarily disabled until we go live with a new online portal later this year. 


How does Medmarc help me select the best defense attorney for my claim?


We have built a network of top-tier attorneys to defend your cases.  All of our attorneys are selected for their expertise in defending medical device and pharmaceutical companies in products liability litigation.  We leverage our buying power in order to secure you with reasonable hourly rates, and our attorneys are required to communicate with you regularly on the status of your claim.
Many of our network counsel have written and lectured on various aspects of product liability.  Some have medical or nursing degrees.  Many also have medical malpractice defense expertise.They are skilled trial attorneys, but they also have negotiating and case resolution skills that can achieve rational business outcomes at mediation and settlement conferences. 


How do I submit changes to our contact information?


Please select subject "Contact Underwriting" in the Request More Information Form on this page. 
Please provide information for your “primary contact,” including your contact’s first and last name, title, address, phone number, fax number, and email address.  If applicable, please also provide this information for any additional contacts for SIR billing, claims, risk management, and loss runs.


How does Medmarc handle a claim or lawsuit outside of the United States?


We have approved network counsel in many foreign countries.  In addition, when servicing foreign claims, we rely on a number of international resources for loss investigation and litigation control.  These include: 

GAB Robins Worldwide
Baker & McKenzie Worldwide Legal Network
Lex Mundi Directory of Foreign Counsel
American Law Firm Association (ALFA)
International Legal Network



What types of coverages does Medmarc provide?




Medmarc offers Products/Completed Operations Liability (“Products Liability”) and Manufacturers’ Errors and Omissions Liability (“E&O”) for medical technology and life sciences companies.
For more information on each coverage type, go to our Insurance Solutions


What kind of product recall coverage is available through Medmarc?


Coverage for FDA recalls may be found in two types of Medmarc coverage offerings. 

Products Liability — Medmarc offers product-withdrawal-expense coverage as an endorsement to our products liability policy.  This endorsement, subject to terms and exclusions, covers expenses incurred by the insured to remove its product from the marketplace due to a Class I product recall, including expenses associated with communicating the recall to the public. 
Manufacturers’ Errors & Omissions (E&O) — Medmarc offers recall coverage for third-party financial loss that results from the insured’s error or omission, such as when the insured’s customer incurs expenses for undertaking a recall that arises as a result of the insured’s negligence in manufacturing or servicing of a product.

Please talk to your Medmarc underwriter if your client has a need for this coverage or would like to learn more. 


What happens when I report a claim?


We typically assign the claim to a claim examiner upon receiving it.  The claim examiner will review and analyze the claim for coverage, liability, and damages issues and contact you normally within 24 hours.  
In litigated cases, we assist you in the selection of defense counsel, with whom we work closely until your matter is resolved.  Your input is crucial to a successful defense strategy, and your claim examiner will update you throughout the life of your claim—but no less frequently than on a quarterly basis—about the progress of bringing your claim to resolution.


Do Medmarc claim examiners specialize in life sciences?


Yes.  Medmarc has a team of experienced claim examiners dedicated to the life sciences industry, who handle only life sciences claims.  Each examiner has a minimum of ten years’ experience and hold a variety of degrees and designations including law degrees, actuarial degrees, and Associate in Claims (AIC) designations.  To remain on the cutting edge of developments in the law and the life sciences, Medmarc’s claim examiners participate regularly in industry educational programs. Medmarc is a proud corporate member of DRI, ALFA, and USLAW organizations.


I am not an insured, but may I still receive risk management assistance from Medmarc?




Our risk management services are intended for use by our insureds.  On a limited basis, however, we will provide products liability risk management services on a fee-for-service basis. 
For more information, please contact our Risk Management Department at RiskManagement@Medmarc.com or at 703-652-1362.


Is the fact that a product is approved by the FDA sufficient enough information about the product to obtain a quote from Medmarc?




FDA approval of a product is important to the underwriting analysis, as is the regulatory history of the company, but it is not sufficient information for Medmarc’s underwriters to provide a coverage quote. In order to understand the company’s risk profile and coverage needs, underwriters also will require information about the company’s size, financial condition, management team, operations, loss history, and other information related to the company’s history and product lines.


What is Medmarc’s capacity?




For Medmarc’s products liability policy, our capacity is $10 million per policy.  For our manufacturers’ errors and omissions (E&O) policy, our capacity is $5 million.  
Capacity is subject to underwriting and is not available for all applicants. 


What is Medmarc's target risk?




Medmarc provides coverage for the manufacturers and distributors of medical devices, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, in vitro diagnostics, personal hygiene products, and animal care products.  We cover both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and contract manufacturers.  We cover companies at every stage of their evolution—from clinical trial-stage startups to multi-national companies with extensive product lines.


What risk management services does Medmarc provide?




Through our Risk Management Department, Medmarc helps medical technology and life sciences companies manage their products liability risks.  We can identify your potential products liability exposures through our risk assessment process and then help you develop and implement strategies to mitigate your risk.  
We provide assistance with areas of your operations that tend to give rise to products liability, such as supply chains, product warnings and instructions for use, and manufacturing procedures.  There is a close association between regulatory compliance and products liability.  For this reason, we offer a variety of services designed to help companies comply with FDA requirements. 
We also provide employee training that is designed to heighten awareness about products liability risk and the impact that it can have on your operations and bottom line.


Will Medmarc accept other carriers’ applications?




Yes.  Medmarc is happy to accept applications from other carriers, but please be aware that we may require additional information.


As a distributor, do I need products liability coverage?




We recommend that distributors purchase their own products liability insurance policies.  If a distributor is required to repackage or install a product, or if the distributor provides training on the use of the product, the distributor may have a potential exposure that is not typically covered under the manufacturer’s policy.  Furthermore, independent acts of negligence on the part of the distributor typically would not be covered under the manufacturer’s policy or by contractual indemnification agreements. A U.S. distributor that imports products from a manufacturer located outside of the United States should be aware that the foreign manufacturer’s policy may not provide coverage in the U.S. or may not provide coverage for the defense of claims in the U.S., which could become very costly.  Medmarc’s Risk Management Department has published an article that explains distributor risks. The article is titled, “Why Distributors May Be More  Vulnerable to Products Liability than They Realize,” and it is available on Medmarc’s website in our Resource Library.


Does your policy cover sales representatives (“sales reps”)?




The actions or omissions of sales reps when acting in the scope of their employment are covered under Medmarc’s products liability insurance coverage. Such circumstances include when sales reps: (1) provide product consultations; (2) make device technical adjustments; (3) are present in operating rooms during surgeries to answer questions deemed essential for patient care; or (4) are present during patient monitoring visits to ensure compliance with clinical trial protocols by surgical staff and nurses.
For more information, see the Ask an Expert by Fran Stockwell, “Do distributors require professional liability insurance coverage in addition to products liability insurance coverage?”
 


Does your policy cover explants of implantable devices?




Our products liability policy covers explantations (i.e., the surgical removal of implantable devices) only when the product causes the patient harm.


What is the difference between a claims-made policy and an occurrence policy?



Insurance coverage can either be on a "claims made" or "occurrence" basis. These terms refer to what the policy covers during the policy period. A claims-made policy provides insurance for claims made during a policy year (or tail period) regardless of when the loss occurred, and an occurrence policy provides insurance for losses that occurred only during the policy year (as specified on the declarations form). A "claims made" policy provides coverage for claims made (and reported) during the policy term as long as they were made after the "retroactive date." (The retroactive date is the start date of the first claims-made policy obtained, so long as it has been kept active (via renewal).) That date remains the same and is not advanced as long as the policy is renewed. For example, if a client first obtains claims-made coverage on October 1, 2008, and it is now 2013 and they've maintained the same coverage, their claims-made policy covers all incidents since October 1, 2008. If the client no longer has coverage in 2014, and a patient sues in 2014 for an incident that occurred in 2008, the client does not have coverage for that incident (unless they purchased tail coverage). 
An "occurrence" policy, in contrast, covers incidents that occur (but are not necessarily reported) during the term the policy is in force. For example, if a client obtained an occurrence policy covering 2008-2009, and a patient is injured by the client's product in 2009, but does not sue for their injuries until 2011, the client has coverage from their 2008-2009 policy, even if they are no longer insured.


Will Medmarc provide coverage for non-medical products?




Because of our familiarity and long-standing connection with this industry, we recognize that life sciences companies sometimes have product lines that include non-medical products. Often, we can accommodate this coverage need.  Your Medmarc underwriter can answer any questions you might have about covering non-medical products and will walk you through specific coverage options for your insureds.


What information do you need to assess a clinical trial risk?




For clinical trial submissions, include the draft or final study protocol and the patient informed consent document in order to expedite our review.


How do I obtain a quote for manufacturers' errors and omissions (E&O) coverage from Medmarc?




The E&O application can be found here. Along with a completed application, your Medmarc underwriter simply needs a sample of your client’s contracts or purchase orders that they use with their customers.


How does Medmarc calculate minimum premiums?




Minimum premiums differ depending on several factors, such as a product’s risk profile and the state in which the company is located. 
If you have a small account and are interested discussing the cost of coverage in greater detail, please call George Ayd at (703) 652-1309.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.







this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.







Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. 

Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.

They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.

I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.







What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.







One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.







Miserable experience!  Short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone.







Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. 
Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?







Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.







I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.







Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!







Who woulda thunk it? "Hmmm...let me check the reviews on this insurance place, because I HAVE to have insurance!"
Going with Safety is a gamble! The house always wins.







Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...

On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.

Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.

For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age.

"We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.

But then it gets better ...

I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  

Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.

The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. 

So to sum up, here's how it goes:
1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.
2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.
3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.
4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.

Their business policies are questionable, at best.







I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!







Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. 

A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. 

They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! 

Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  

Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.

Well done Safety. And THANKS!







I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.

Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.







Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.







Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.

Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.

I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.

I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. 

When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.

Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.

The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. 

They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.







If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.







My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.







I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.

this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.

Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.

What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.

One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.

Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?

Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.

I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.

Updated review










            Listed in Adventures In My Car...


Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age."We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.But then it gets better ...I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. So to sum up, here's how it goes:1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.Their business policies are questionable, at best.

Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again...…
Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again... unfortunately, as an insurance company, I don't call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are, I call you when there's a problem.  And just as I expected and as history repeats itself, you weren't there.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.On a sunny Saturday afternoon, cruising down 128 with my dog buckled in the backseat, we were behind a truck and like a slow-motion movie, the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out.  There were three no-win options:  swerve and cause an accident, slam on the brakes and cause an accident, or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best.  With a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with Safety after being the one being rear-ended, I plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield.  Not sure what to do, I got off at the next exit and called Safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible.  Since it was a glass-only claim, this is what I received:"Oh we're sorry, you will have to call back during normal business hours.  Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, from 8am to 5pm."Say what?  So, bottom line is this ... there is no 24/7 service with Safety.  Yes, it is an auto insurance company, but if you are in an accident or if you need help, they are only available during normal business hours which, statistically speaking, is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help.  Like I said, you don't call an auto insurance company just to say hi, see how things are going, and to shoot the breeze.  No, you call them when there is an emergency and you need help.Phone calls went unreturned.Emails went unanswered.Another scathing Facebook post and tweet.To sum it up, I took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired.  With a snowstorm looming in the forecast, it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and that's just what I did.  For the longest time, I told my husband I was done with Safety Insurance, and now I mean it.Safety Insurance, we are breaking up.  Your crappy customer service, your shitty hours, and your incompetent agents just aren't cutting it anymore.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.

We have Safety Insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance.  Unfortunately, we have had to file claims under both policies.  In 2009, our homeowner's claim was to cover damage from a storm.  The claim representative was very polite, compassionate, and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week.  The house was fixed, we were happy, and life went on.  That experience is the only reason why this is a 2-star review.Safety Insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance.  With a great credit score, a perfect driving record, and a newer vehicle, they offered me a great deal and I signed on.  All was good until I was rear-ended on my way to work one morning.  My phone call to Safety Insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with "Sorry, we don't have any claims representatives right now.  But you can leave a message."  At that point, I should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car, back up, and plow right through me.  Because had I known what I know now, getting hit again by a 1996 Chevy Astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with Safety.  When the Butterball Turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company, you know you're in trouble.As an educated individual, I know that insurance companies really don't care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident.  They want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you don't lawyer-up.  Insurance companies make money.  That is their business.As a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company, I was treated as if I was a felon.  Phone calls went unanswered.  Emails were transferred to clueless representatives.  "We'll get back to you."  Yeah right, and the checks are in the mail.  The accident was in September 2012 and it wasn't resolved until May 2013.  That's 8 months!  It wasn't until I left a scathing Facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me.  In conclusion:  yes, their rates as a good driver are very competitive.  However, Safety Insurance is only good until you need them.  Claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude.  Even as the "victim" your only effective way of getting compensated for your out-of-pocket costs from an accident are to lawyer-up.I can think of a million other things I'd rather do than have to call Safety Insurance when there is an emergency and I need help.  In fact, I'm fairly positive I'd get more help from an ex-boyfriend that I broke up with via a text-message than the help I got from Safety.

I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!

Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.Well done Safety. And THANKS!

I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.

Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.

Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.

My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.

I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.







this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.







Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. 

Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.

They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.

I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.







What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.







One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.







Miserable experience!  Short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone.







Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. 
Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?







Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.







I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.







Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!







Who woulda thunk it? "Hmmm...let me check the reviews on this insurance place, because I HAVE to have insurance!"
Going with Safety is a gamble! The house always wins.







Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...

On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.

Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.

For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age.

"We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.

But then it gets better ...

I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  

Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.

The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. 

So to sum up, here's how it goes:
1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.
2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.
3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.
4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.

Their business policies are questionable, at best.







I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!







Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. 

A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. 

They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! 

Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  

Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.

Well done Safety. And THANKS!







I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.

Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.







Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.







Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.

Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.

I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.

I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. 

When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.

Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.

The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. 

They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.







If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.







My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.







I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?

Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.

I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.

Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!

            Listed in Adventures In My Car...


Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age."We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.But then it gets better ...I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. So to sum up, here's how it goes:1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.Their business policies are questionable, at best.

Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again... unfortunately, as an insurance company, I don't call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are, I call you when there's a problem.  And just as I expected and as history repeats itself, you weren't there.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.On a sunny Saturday afternoon, cruising down 128 with my dog buckled in the backseat, we were behind a truck and like a slow-motion movie, the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out.  There were three no-win options:  swerve and cause an accident, slam on the brakes and cause an accident, or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best.  With a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with Safety after being the one being rear-ended, I plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield.  Not sure what to do, I got off at the next exit and called Safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible.  Since it was a glass-only claim, this is what I received:"Oh we're sorry, you will have to call back during normal business hours.  Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, from 8am to 5pm."Say what?  So, bottom line is this ... there is no 24/7 service with Safety.  Yes, it is an auto insurance company, but if you are in an accident or if you need help, they are only available during normal business hours which, statistically speaking, is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help.  Like I said, you don't call an auto insurance company just to say hi, see how things are going, and to shoot the breeze.  No, you call them when there is an emergency and you need help.Phone calls went unreturned.Emails went unanswered.Another scathing Facebook post and tweet.To sum it up, I took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired.  With a snowstorm looming in the forecast, it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and that's just what I did.  For the longest time, I told my husband I was done with Safety Insurance, and now I mean it.Safety Insurance, we are breaking up.  Your crappy customer service, your shitty hours, and your incompetent agents just aren't cutting it anymore.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.

We have Safety Insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance.  Unfortunately, we have had to file claims under both policies.  In 2009, our homeowner's claim was to cover damage from a storm.  The claim representative was very polite, compassionate, and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week.  The house was fixed, we were happy, and life went on.  That experience is the only reason why this is a 2-star review.Safety Insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance.  With a great credit score, a perfect driving record, and a newer vehicle, they offered me a great deal and I signed on.  All was good until I was rear-ended on my way to work one morning.  My phone call to Safety Insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with "Sorry, we don't have any claims representatives right now.  But you can leave a message."  At that point, I should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car, back up, and plow right through me.  Because had I known what I know now, getting hit again by a 1996 Chevy Astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with Safety.  When the Butterball Turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company, you know you're in trouble.As an educated individual, I know that insurance companies really don't care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident.  They want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you don't lawyer-up.  Insurance companies make money.  That is their business.As a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company, I was treated as if I was a felon.  Phone calls went unanswered.  Emails were transferred to clueless representatives.  "We'll get back to you."  Yeah right, and the checks are in the mail.  The accident was in September 2012 and it wasn't resolved until May 2013.  That's 8 months!  It wasn't until I left a scathing Facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me.  In conclusion:  yes, their rates as a good driver are very competitive.  However, Safety Insurance is only good until you need them.  Claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude.  Even as the "victim" your only effective way of getting compensated for your out-of-pocket costs from an accident are to lawyer-up.I can think of a million other things I'd rather do than have to call Safety Insurance when there is an emergency and I need help.  In fact, I'm fairly positive I'd get more help from an ex-boyfriend that I broke up with via a text-message than the help I got from Safety.

I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!

Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.Well done Safety. And THANKS!

I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.

Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.

Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.

I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.







I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!







Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. 

Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.

They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.

I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.







Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. 

A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. 

They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! 

Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  

Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.

Well done Safety. And THANKS!







I've been with Safety for my auto insurance since 1997 and have two homeowner policies with them (one since 2004 and one since October of this year). I've been involved in 3 car accidents, none of which were my fault, and the auto claims were all handled to my satisfaction (perhaps it helps that I have an insurance agent). I shop around for quotes each year and have not had another insurance company beat Safety's quotes.

As for my homeowner's insurance, I've never needed to file a claim. When I was shopping around for a policy for my new house in October, I received 8 quotes for the same coverage amount and Safety was the lowest.







I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.

Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.







this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.







One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.







I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.







Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.







What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.







If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.







Miserable experience!  Short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone.







Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.







Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. 
Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?







Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!







I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.







Safety Insurance cancelled my policy with no notice and did not inform me of a lapse in insurance coverage. They are utterly incompetent and steer clear of this agency!







My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.







I had an auto policy with Safety.  I was a member for over two years and always paid on time. I made ONE late payment and they canceled my insurance and then refused to reinstate me on their policy even after reviewing my payment history. It was bizarre.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.

I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!

Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.

Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.Well done Safety. And THANKS!

I've been with Safety for my auto insurance since 1997 and have two homeowner policies with them (one since 2004 and one since October of this year). I've been involved in 3 car accidents, none of which were my fault, and the auto claims were all handled to my satisfaction (perhaps it helps that I have an insurance agent). I shop around for quotes each year and have not had another insurance company beat Safety's quotes.As for my homeowner's insurance, I've never needed to file a claim. When I was shopping around for a policy for my new house in October, I received 8 quotes for the same coverage amount and Safety was the lowest.

I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.

this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.

One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.

I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.

Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.

What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.

Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.

Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?

I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

I had an auto policy with Safety.  I was a member for over two years and always paid on time. I made ONE late payment and they canceled my insurance and then refused to reinstate me on their policy even after reviewing my payment history. It was bizarre.

20 Custom House StBoston, MA 02110

this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.







One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.







I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.







Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.







What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.







If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.







Miserable experience!  Short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone.







Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.







Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. 
Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?







Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!







I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.







Safety Insurance cancelled my policy with no notice and did not inform me of a lapse in insurance coverage. They are utterly incompetent and steer clear of this agency!







My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.







I had an auto policy with Safety.  I was a member for over two years and always paid on time. I made ONE late payment and they canceled my insurance and then refused to reinstate me on their policy even after reviewing my payment history. It was bizarre.







Who woulda thunk it? "Hmmm...let me check the reviews on this insurance place, because I HAVE to have insurance!"
Going with Safety is a gamble! The house always wins.







if i could give 0 stars i would!! go with amica please! horrible as heck.
someone hit me and they found him not at fault, same insurance but i had lower coverage for heaven sakes there is a camera right where it happened idiots.
they dont want to pay. i beg do not get... service sucks







Who deleted my review about this predjudice stereotypical insurance they are not supportive dont be in my shoes stay far away :-(







Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...

On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.

Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.

For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age.

"We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.

But then it gets better ...

I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  

Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.

The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. 

So to sum up, here's how it goes:
1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.
2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.
3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.
4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.

Their business policies are questionable, at best.







I am currently waiting in the claims services office in Newton, MA. I've been waiting for over an hour now to receive my total loss settlement check (one of their clients hit me).

However, thanks to the incompetence of Heather, the agent in charge of my file, what should have been a quick pick up has become a long waiting game for everyone at this office. Even before this, it would take at least (I kid you not) ten phone calls to get one back from her. And apparently, she did not contact this claims office about my settlement, so we are now going on a 1.5 hour wait until she comes back from her lunch break. 

Thanks to her, I will never consider Safety Insurance for myself, and will make sure to warn others from this company. Stay away.







Safety Insurance is the worst company I have dealt with ever.  I am going to switch my policy and never do business with them again. I filed a claim for my home and it went from crazy to crazier...it took them 26 days to follow up with me.

this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.

One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.

I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.

Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.

What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.

Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.

Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?

I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

I had an auto policy with Safety.  I was a member for over two years and always paid on time. I made ONE late payment and they canceled my insurance and then refused to reinstate me on their policy even after reviewing my payment history. It was bizarre.

I am a previous safety insurance client. My car was vandalized. I live in a high crime area where cars are often stolen or vandalized. I reported this accident to my insurance and they made it seem like everything would be fine. They told me to tow my car to a shop for repairs. After apraising my car they tell the shop to start repairing my car but an hour later they tell the shop they are waiting for liability. After no call back i returned a call to find out my adjuster passed my case to special investigations..why because o was a victim of vandalism before.. So now not only am i a victim of a tag artist. I am a victim of insurance not backing you when expected..As for my case they claim to be awaiting paperwork but i believe they are racist and stereotype minorities learn from my mistakes!!

Updated review

Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age."We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.But then it gets better ...I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. So to sum up, here's how it goes:1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.Their business policies are questionable, at best.

Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again... unfortunately, as an insurance company, I don't call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are, I call you when there's a problem.  And just as I expected and as history repeats itself, you weren't there.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.On a sunny Saturday afternoon, cruising down 128 with my dog buckled in the backseat, we were behind a truck and like a slow-motion movie, the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out.  There were three no-win options:  swerve and cause an accident, slam on the brakes and cause an accident, or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best.  With a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with Safety after being the one being rear-ended, I plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield.  Not sure what to do, I got off at the next exit and called Safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible.  Since it was a glass-only claim, this is what I received:"Oh we're sorry, you will have to call back during normal business hours.  Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, from 8am to 5pm."Say what?  So, bottom line is this ... there is no 24/7 service with Safety.  Yes, it is an auto insurance company, but if you are in an accident or if you need help, they are only available during normal business hours which, statistically speaking, is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help.  Like I said, you don't call an auto insurance company just to say hi, see how things are going, and to shoot the breeze.  No, you call them when there is an emergency and you need help.Phone calls went unreturned.Emails went unanswered.Another scathing Facebook post and tweet.To sum it up, I took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired.  With a snowstorm looming in the forecast, it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and that's just what I did.  For the longest time, I told my husband I was done with Safety Insurance, and now I mean it.Safety Insurance, we are breaking up.  Your crappy customer service, your shitty hours, and your incompetent agents just aren't cutting it anymore.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.

We have Safety Insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance.  Unfortunately, we have had to file claims under both policies.  In 2009, our homeowner's claim was to cover damage from a storm.  The claim representative was very polite, compassionate, and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week.  The house was fixed, we were happy, and life went on.  That experience is the only reason why this is a 2-star review.Safety Insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance.  With a great credit score, a perfect driving record, and a newer vehicle, they offered me a great deal and I signed on.  All was good until I was rear-ended on my way to work one morning.  My phone call to Safety Insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with "Sorry, we don't have any claims representatives right now.  But you can leave a message."  At that point, I should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car, back up, and plow right through me.  Because had I known what I know now, getting hit again by a 1996 Chevy Astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with Safety.  When the Butterball Turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company, you know you're in trouble.As an educated individual, I know that insurance companies really don't care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident.  They want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you don't lawyer-up.  Insurance companies make money.  That is their business.As a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company, I was treated as if I was a felon.  Phone calls went unanswered.  Emails were transferred to clueless representatives.  "We'll get back to you."  Yeah right, and the checks are in the mail.  The accident was in September 2012 and it wasn't resolved until May 2013.  That's 8 months!  It wasn't until I left a scathing Facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me.  In conclusion:  yes, their rates as a good driver are very competitive.  However, Safety Insurance is only good until you need them.  Claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude.  Even as the "victim" your only effective way of getting compensated for your out-of-pocket costs from an accident are to lawyer-up.I can think of a million other things I'd rather do than have to call Safety Insurance when there is an emergency and I need help.  In fact, I'm fairly positive I'd get more help from an ex-boyfriend that I broke up with via a text-message than the help I got from Safety.

I am currently waiting in the claims services office in Newton, MA. I've been waiting for over an hour now to receive my total loss settlement check (one of their clients hit me).However, thanks to the incompetence of Heather, the agent in charge of my file, what should have been a quick pick up has become a long waiting game for everyone at this office. Even before this, it would take at least (I kid you not) ten phone calls to get one back from her. And apparently, she did not contact this claims office about my settlement, so we are now going on a 1.5 hour wait until she comes back from her lunch break. Thanks to her, I will never consider Safety Insurance for myself, and will make sure to warn others from this company. Stay away.

Safety Insurance is the worst company I have dealt with ever.  I am going to switch my policy and never do business with them again. I filed a claim for my home and it went from crazy to crazier...it took them 26 days to follow up with me.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.







this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.







Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. 

Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.

They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.

I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.







What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.







One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.







Miserable experience!  Short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone.







Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. 
Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?







Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.







I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.







Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!







Who woulda thunk it? "Hmmm...let me check the reviews on this insurance place, because I HAVE to have insurance!"
Going with Safety is a gamble! The house always wins.







Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...

On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.

Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.

For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age.

"We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.

But then it gets better ...

I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  

Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.

The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. 

So to sum up, here's how it goes:
1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.
2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.
3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.
4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.

Their business policies are questionable, at best.







I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!







Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. 

A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. 

They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! 

Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  

Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.

Well done Safety. And THANKS!







I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.

Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.







Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.







Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.

Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.

I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.

I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. 

When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.

Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.

The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. 

They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.







If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.







My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.







I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.

this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.

Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.

I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.

Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!

Who woulda thunk it? "Hmmm...let me check the reviews on this insurance place, because I HAVE to have insurance!"Going with Safety is a gamble! The house always wins.

            Listed in Adventures In My Car...


Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age."We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.But then it gets better ...I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. So to sum up, here's how it goes:1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.Their business policies are questionable, at best.

Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again... unfortunately, as an insurance company, I don't call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are, I call you when there's a problem.  And just as I expected and as history repeats itself, you weren't there.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.On a sunny Saturday afternoon, cruising down 128 with my dog buckled in the backseat, we were behind a truck and like a slow-motion movie, the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out.  There were three no-win options:  swerve and cause an accident, slam on the brakes and cause an accident, or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best.  With a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with Safety after being the one being rear-ended, I plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield.  Not sure what to do, I got off at the next exit and called Safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible.  Since it was a glass-only claim, this is what I received:"Oh we're sorry, you will have to call back during normal business hours.  Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, from 8am to 5pm."Say what?  So, bottom line is this ... there is no 24/7 service with Safety.  Yes, it is an auto insurance company, but if you are in an accident or if you need help, they are only available during normal business hours which, statistically speaking, is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help.  Like I said, you don't call an auto insurance company just to say hi, see how things are going, and to shoot the breeze.  No, you call them when there is an emergency and you need help.Phone calls went unreturned.Emails went unanswered.Another scathing Facebook post and tweet.To sum it up, I took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired.  With a snowstorm looming in the forecast, it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and that's just what I did.  For the longest time, I told my husband I was done with Safety Insurance, and now I mean it.Safety Insurance, we are breaking up.  Your crappy customer service, your shitty hours, and your incompetent agents just aren't cutting it anymore.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.

We have Safety Insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance.  Unfortunately, we have had to file claims under both policies.  In 2009, our homeowner's claim was to cover damage from a storm.  The claim representative was very polite, compassionate, and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week.  The house was fixed, we were happy, and life went on.  That experience is the only reason why this is a 2-star review.Safety Insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance.  With a great credit score, a perfect driving record, and a newer vehicle, they offered me a great deal and I signed on.  All was good until I was rear-ended on my way to work one morning.  My phone call to Safety Insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with "Sorry, we don't have any claims representatives right now.  But you can leave a message."  At that point, I should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car, back up, and plow right through me.  Because had I known what I know now, getting hit again by a 1996 Chevy Astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with Safety.  When the Butterball Turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company, you know you're in trouble.As an educated individual, I know that insurance companies really don't care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident.  They want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you don't lawyer-up.  Insurance companies make money.  That is their business.As a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company, I was treated as if I was a felon.  Phone calls went unanswered.  Emails were transferred to clueless representatives.  "We'll get back to you."  Yeah right, and the checks are in the mail.  The accident was in September 2012 and it wasn't resolved until May 2013.  That's 8 months!  It wasn't until I left a scathing Facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me.  In conclusion:  yes, their rates as a good driver are very competitive.  However, Safety Insurance is only good until you need them.  Claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude.  Even as the "victim" your only effective way of getting compensated for your out-of-pocket costs from an accident are to lawyer-up.I can think of a million other things I'd rather do than have to call Safety Insurance when there is an emergency and I need help.  In fact, I'm fairly positive I'd get more help from an ex-boyfriend that I broke up with via a text-message than the help I got from Safety.

I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!

Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.Well done Safety. And THANKS!

I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.

Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.

Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.

I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.







Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. 

Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.

They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.

I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.







What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.







One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.







Miserable experience!  Short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone.







Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. 
Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?







Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.







I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.







Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!







Who woulda thunk it? "Hmmm...let me check the reviews on this insurance place, because I HAVE to have insurance!"
Going with Safety is a gamble! The house always wins.







Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...

On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.

Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.

For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age.

"We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.

But then it gets better ...

I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  

Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.

The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. 

So to sum up, here's how it goes:
1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.
2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.
3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.
4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.

Their business policies are questionable, at best.







I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!







Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. 

A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. 

They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! 

Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  

Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.

Well done Safety. And THANKS!







I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.

Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.







Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.







Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.

Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.

I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.

I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. 

When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.

Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.

The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. 

They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.







If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.







My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.







I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.

Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.

What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.

One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.

Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?

Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.

I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.

Updated review










            Listed in Adventures In My Car...


Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age."We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.But then it gets better ...I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. So to sum up, here's how it goes:1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.Their business policies are questionable, at best.

Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again...…
Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again... unfortunately, as an insurance company, I don't call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are, I call you when there's a problem.  And just as I expected and as history repeats itself, you weren't there.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.On a sunny Saturday afternoon, cruising down 128 with my dog buckled in the backseat, we were behind a truck and like a slow-motion movie, the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out.  There were three no-win options:  swerve and cause an accident, slam on the brakes and cause an accident, or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best.  With a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with Safety after being the one being rear-ended, I plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield.  Not sure what to do, I got off at the next exit and called Safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible.  Since it was a glass-only claim, this is what I received:"Oh we're sorry, you will have to call back during normal business hours.  Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, from 8am to 5pm."Say what?  So, bottom line is this ... there is no 24/7 service with Safety.  Yes, it is an auto insurance company, but if you are in an accident or if you need help, they are only available during normal business hours which, statistically speaking, is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help.  Like I said, you don't call an auto insurance company just to say hi, see how things are going, and to shoot the breeze.  No, you call them when there is an emergency and you need help.Phone calls went unreturned.Emails went unanswered.Another scathing Facebook post and tweet.To sum it up, I took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired.  With a snowstorm looming in the forecast, it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and that's just what I did.  For the longest time, I told my husband I was done with Safety Insurance, and now I mean it.Safety Insurance, we are breaking up.  Your crappy customer service, your shitty hours, and your incompetent agents just aren't cutting it anymore.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.

We have Safety Insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance.  Unfortunately, we have had to file claims under both policies.  In 2009, our homeowner's claim was to cover damage from a storm.  The claim representative was very polite, compassionate, and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week.  The house was fixed, we were happy, and life went on.  That experience is the only reason why this is a 2-star review.Safety Insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance.  With a great credit score, a perfect driving record, and a newer vehicle, they offered me a great deal and I signed on.  All was good until I was rear-ended on my way to work one morning.  My phone call to Safety Insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with "Sorry, we don't have any claims representatives right now.  But you can leave a message."  At that point, I should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car, back up, and plow right through me.  Because had I known what I know now, getting hit again by a 1996 Chevy Astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with Safety.  When the Butterball Turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company, you know you're in trouble.As an educated individual, I know that insurance companies really don't care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident.  They want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you don't lawyer-up.  Insurance companies make money.  That is their business.As a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company, I was treated as if I was a felon.  Phone calls went unanswered.  Emails were transferred to clueless representatives.  "We'll get back to you."  Yeah right, and the checks are in the mail.  The accident was in September 2012 and it wasn't resolved until May 2013.  That's 8 months!  It wasn't until I left a scathing Facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me.  In conclusion:  yes, their rates as a good driver are very competitive.  However, Safety Insurance is only good until you need them.  Claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude.  Even as the "victim" your only effective way of getting compensated for your out-of-pocket costs from an accident are to lawyer-up.I can think of a million other things I'd rather do than have to call Safety Insurance when there is an emergency and I need help.  In fact, I'm fairly positive I'd get more help from an ex-boyfriend that I broke up with via a text-message than the help I got from Safety.

I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!

Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.Well done Safety. And THANKS!

I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.

Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.

Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.

My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.

I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.







this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.







Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. 

Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.

They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.

I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.







What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.







Miserable experience!  Short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone.







Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. 
Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?







Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.







I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.







Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!







Who woulda thunk it? "Hmmm...let me check the reviews on this insurance place, because I HAVE to have insurance!"
Going with Safety is a gamble! The house always wins.







Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...

On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.

Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.

For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age.

"We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.

But then it gets better ...

I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  

Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.

The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. 

So to sum up, here's how it goes:
1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.
2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.
3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.
4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.

Their business policies are questionable, at best.







I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!







Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. 

A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. 

They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! 

Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  

Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.

Well done Safety. And THANKS!







I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.

Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.







Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.







Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.

Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.

I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.

I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. 

When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.

Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.

The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. 

They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.







If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.







My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.







I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.

this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.

Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.

What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.

Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?

Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.

I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.

Updated review










            Listed in Adventures In My Car...


Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age."We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.But then it gets better ...I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. So to sum up, here's how it goes:1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.Their business policies are questionable, at best.

Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again... unfortunately, as an insurance company, I don't call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are, I call you when there's a problem.  And just as I expected and as history repeats itself, you weren't there.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.On a sunny Saturday afternoon, cruising down 128 with my dog buckled in the backseat, we were behind a truck and like a slow-motion movie, the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out.  There were three no-win options:  swerve and cause an accident, slam on the brakes and cause an accident, or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best.  With a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with Safety after being the one being rear-ended, I plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield.  Not sure what to do, I got off at the next exit and called Safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible.  Since it was a glass-only claim, this is what I received:"Oh we're sorry, you will have to call back during normal business hours.  Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, from 8am to 5pm."Say what?  So, bottom line is this ... there is no 24/7 service with Safety.  Yes, it is an auto insurance company, but if you are in an accident or if you need help, they are only available during normal business hours which, statistically speaking, is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help.  Like I said, you don't call an auto insurance company just to say hi, see how things are going, and to shoot the breeze.  No, you call them when there is an emergency and you need help.Phone calls went unreturned.Emails went unanswered.Another scathing Facebook post and tweet.To sum it up, I took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired.  With a snowstorm looming in the forecast, it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and that's just what I did.  For the longest time, I told my husband I was done with Safety Insurance, and now I mean it.Safety Insurance, we are breaking up.  Your crappy customer service, your shitty hours, and your incompetent agents just aren't cutting it anymore.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.

We have Safety Insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance.  Unfortunately, we have had to file claims under both policies.  In 2009, our homeowner's claim was to cover damage from a storm.  The claim representative was very polite, compassionate, and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week.  The house was fixed, we were happy, and life went on.  That experience is the only reason why this is a 2-star review.Safety Insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance.  With a great credit score, a perfect driving record, and a newer vehicle, they offered me a great deal and I signed on.  All was good until I was rear-ended on my way to work one morning.  My phone call to Safety Insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with "Sorry, we don't have any claims representatives right now.  But you can leave a message."  At that point, I should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car, back up, and plow right through me.  Because had I known what I know now, getting hit again by a 1996 Chevy Astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with Safety.  When the Butterball Turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company, you know you're in trouble.As an educated individual, I know that insurance companies really don't care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident.  They want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you don't lawyer-up.  Insurance companies make money.  That is their business.As a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company, I was treated as if I was a felon.  Phone calls went unanswered.  Emails were transferred to clueless representatives.  "We'll get back to you."  Yeah right, and the checks are in the mail.  The accident was in September 2012 and it wasn't resolved until May 2013.  That's 8 months!  It wasn't until I left a scathing Facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me.  In conclusion:  yes, their rates as a good driver are very competitive.  However, Safety Insurance is only good until you need them.  Claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude.  Even as the "victim" your only effective way of getting compensated for your out-of-pocket costs from an accident are to lawyer-up.I can think of a million other things I'd rather do than have to call Safety Insurance when there is an emergency and I need help.  In fact, I'm fairly positive I'd get more help from an ex-boyfriend that I broke up with via a text-message than the help I got from Safety.

I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!

Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.Well done Safety. And THANKS!

I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.

Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.

Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.

My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.

I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.







this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.







Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. 

Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.

They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.

I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.







What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.







One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.







Miserable experience!  Short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone.







Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. 
Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?







Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.







I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.







Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!







Who woulda thunk it? "Hmmm...let me check the reviews on this insurance place, because I HAVE to have insurance!"
Going with Safety is a gamble! The house always wins.







Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...

On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.

Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.

For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age.

"We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.

But then it gets better ...

I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  

Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.

The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. 

So to sum up, here's how it goes:
1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.
2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.
3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.
4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.

Their business policies are questionable, at best.







I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!







Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. 

A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. 

They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! 

Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  

Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.

Well done Safety. And THANKS!







I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.

Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.







Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.







Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.

Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.

I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.

I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. 

When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.

Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.

The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. 

They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.







If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.







My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.







I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.

this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.

Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.

What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.

One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.

Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?

Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.

I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.

Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!

Updated review










            Listed in Adventures In My Car...


Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age."We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.But then it gets better ...I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. So to sum up, here's how it goes:1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.Their business policies are questionable, at best.

Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again...…
Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again... unfortunately, as an insurance company, I don't call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are, I call you when there's a problem.  And just as I expected and as history repeats itself, you weren't there.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.On a sunny Saturday afternoon, cruising down 128 with my dog buckled in the backseat, we were behind a truck and like a slow-motion movie, the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out.  There were three no-win options:  swerve and cause an accident, slam on the brakes and cause an accident, or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best.  With a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with Safety after being the one being rear-ended, I plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield.  Not sure what to do, I got off at the next exit and called Safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible.  Since it was a glass-only claim, this is what I received:"Oh we're sorry, you will have to call back during normal business hours.  Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, from 8am to 5pm."Say what?  So, bottom line is this ... there is no 24/7 service with Safety.  Yes, it is an auto insurance company, but if you are in an accident or if you need help, they are only available during normal business hours which, statistically speaking, is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help.  Like I said, you don't call an auto insurance company just to say hi, see how things are going, and to shoot the breeze.  No, you call them when there is an emergency and you need help.Phone calls went unreturned.Emails went unanswered.Another scathing Facebook post and tweet.To sum it up, I took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired.  With a snowstorm looming in the forecast, it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and that's just what I did.  For the longest time, I told my husband I was done with Safety Insurance, and now I mean it.Safety Insurance, we are breaking up.  Your crappy customer service, your shitty hours, and your incompetent agents just aren't cutting it anymore.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.

We have Safety Insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance.  Unfortunately, we have had to file claims under both policies.  In 2009, our homeowner's claim was to cover damage from a storm.  The claim representative was very polite, compassionate, and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week.  The house was fixed, we were happy, and life went on.  That experience is the only reason why this is a 2-star review.Safety Insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance.  With a great credit score, a perfect driving record, and a newer vehicle, they offered me a great deal and I signed on.  All was good until I was rear-ended on my way to work one morning.  My phone call to Safety Insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with "Sorry, we don't have any claims representatives right now.  But you can leave a message."  At that point, I should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car, back up, and plow right through me.  Because had I known what I know now, getting hit again by a 1996 Chevy Astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with Safety.  When the Butterball Turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company, you know you're in trouble.As an educated individual, I know that insurance companies really don't care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident.  They want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you don't lawyer-up.  Insurance companies make money.  That is their business.As a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company, I was treated as if I was a felon.  Phone calls went unanswered.  Emails were transferred to clueless representatives.  "We'll get back to you."  Yeah right, and the checks are in the mail.  The accident was in September 2012 and it wasn't resolved until May 2013.  That's 8 months!  It wasn't until I left a scathing Facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me.  In conclusion:  yes, their rates as a good driver are very competitive.  However, Safety Insurance is only good until you need them.  Claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude.  Even as the "victim" your only effective way of getting compensated for your out-of-pocket costs from an accident are to lawyer-up.I can think of a million other things I'd rather do than have to call Safety Insurance when there is an emergency and I need help.  In fact, I'm fairly positive I'd get more help from an ex-boyfriend that I broke up with via a text-message than the help I got from Safety.

I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!

Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.Well done Safety. And THANKS!

I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.

Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.

Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.

My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.

I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.







this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.







Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. 

Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.

They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.

I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.







What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.







One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.







Miserable experience!  Short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone.







Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. 
Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?







Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.







I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.







Buyer beware!  My husband and I have been with them for DECADES.  After 2 claims in 2 years (NONE before) we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims.  Whoa... I thought I purchased insurance IN CASE I got in an accident... Never, ever... EVER do business with this company  - SCAM!







Who woulda thunk it? "Hmmm...let me check the reviews on this insurance place, because I HAVE to have insurance!"
Going with Safety is a gamble! The house always wins.







Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...

On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.

Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.

For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age.

"We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.

But then it gets better ...

I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  

Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.

The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. 

So to sum up, here's how it goes:
1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.
2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.
3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.
4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.

Their business policies are questionable, at best.







I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!







Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. 

A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. 

They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! 

Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  

Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.

Well done Safety. And THANKS!







I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.

Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.







Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.







Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.

Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.

I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.

I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. 

When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.

Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.

The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. 

They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.







If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.







My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.







I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.

The negative reviews here are puzzling.  Safety VIP centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience.  And because I have the Safety Shield Plus coverage on my policy, the $500 deductible was WAIVED.  I went to the Newton VIP and was helped by Maryellen who was so friendly and professional, she took care of everything.  My "totally covered" rental car was waiting for me and in a few days I will get my 4Runner back, good as new.  The body shops VIP use OEM parts and guarantee their work 100%.

this company is the worst of the worst. claims adjusters regularly don't return calls and I have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back 3 days later. Company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the Safety claims adjuster employee suggests I take Safety to small claims court. I very well may do that.

Had I read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for Safety I would have been scared away! However, I can say as a customer for years, they've been great. Last year a week before Christmas my family was involved in a car accident. I called and was quickly explained the process, which included an adjuster coming to my house on Dec 23rd, the claim being processed in about 2 weeks (including holiday time) and getting us whole once again without any hiccups.They even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite.I really have nothing bad to say, we have our house, multiple cars and toys insured with Safety insurance.

What a joke.  Filed a claim over 2 months ago and it's like pulling teeth to get any updates.  The only time I hear from them is if I reach out - and it's constantly - we are reviewing, I haven't received all the info, pending further investigation.  Then she gives me an estimate of what I would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldn't even cover a dinner for 2 - let alone any of the damages.  What a waste of time.

One star is too much! The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced! Someone falsely opened a claim against me last February, I did not get notified by safety until August. I have proof I was at least 40 miles away from the accident, with my vehicle, and I still have yet to hear anything. All I've received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and I never receive a call back from a person. I will never do business with this company again.

Worst experience ever- I was a customer for over 20 years and just changed companies. My car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays. They made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage, rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith. Never answer phone calls. Days to return a phone call. Just an awful experience altogether. Is there less than 5 stars?

Had a glass claim gave me the runaround I pay close to 5k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under 1k. What a joke and Laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when I told her I'm leaving the company she stated she didn't care and was unprofessional. Hands down the worst insurance company I have had I'm out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice.

I have had safety for 8 years and my parents for almost 30 and thy have always been great. I got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door. My car was a total loss and safety won't insure my rental while I wait for my total loss check (past 30 days). I spoke to 3 people who would not help appeal this matter. Truly disappointing service.

Updated review










            Listed in Adventures In My Car...


Just when we thought Safety Insurance couldn't get any worse, they do!  If you're reading Yelp reviews to determine whether or not you'd want to use Safety Insurance, please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what you'll have to deal with ...On the night before Thanksgiving, Hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight.  We called Safety Insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday which included Thursday (the actual holiday), Friday (FYI - it's not an official holiday), Saturday and Sunday (because Safety Insurance's business hours are only between 8-4:30 M-F).  You think I'm kidding, but I'm not.Once again, we call Safety Insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello.For an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age."We're sorry, but the office is closed on Friday as part of the Thanksgiving Holiday..."  Funny, because they had no problem processing my payment due that day.But then it gets better ...I continued to send scathing tweets and Facebook posts to Safety Insurance and we finally received a phone call on Friday.  And as it turned out, Safety had no record of coverage on my husband's car.  They only had coverage on his prior vehicle, not his current vehicle which was purchased 11 months prior.  Safety Insurance, you fucked up and you fucked up big time.  For 11 months, we were riding around with no coverage (according to them) while paying for it.  Had we been in an accident regardless of fault, we would have been royally screwed.  Their "hours" are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent.  My puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at Safety Insurance.The glass was fixed, but I would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with Safety again. So to sum up, here's how it goes:1.  They are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year.2.  There were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in Massachusetts.  They also did not realize my name or my husband's name was associated with this "mystery" vehicle.3.  Since your insurance is your proof of registration in MA, there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased.4.  The only way you're going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of Alec Baldwin's playbook and go berserk on Twitter and Facebook.  It's funny how quickly they can "magically" locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum.Their business policies are questionable, at best.

Oh Safety Insurance, with your crappy customer service and absurd hours, we meet again... unfortunately, as an insurance company, I don't call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are, I call you when there's a problem.  And just as I expected and as history repeats itself, you weren't there.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.On a sunny Saturday afternoon, cruising down 128 with my dog buckled in the backseat, we were behind a truck and like a slow-motion movie, the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out.  There were three no-win options:  swerve and cause an accident, slam on the brakes and cause an accident, or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best.  With a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with Safety after being the one being rear-ended, I plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield.  Not sure what to do, I got off at the next exit and called Safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible.  Since it was a glass-only claim, this is what I received:"Oh we're sorry, you will have to call back during normal business hours.  Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, from 8am to 5pm."Say what?  So, bottom line is this ... there is no 24/7 service with Safety.  Yes, it is an auto insurance company, but if you are in an accident or if you need help, they are only available during normal business hours which, statistically speaking, is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help.  Like I said, you don't call an auto insurance company just to say hi, see how things are going, and to shoot the breeze.  No, you call them when there is an emergency and you need help.Phone calls went unreturned.Emails went unanswered.Another scathing Facebook post and tweet.To sum it up, I took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired.  With a snowstorm looming in the forecast, it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and that's just what I did.  For the longest time, I told my husband I was done with Safety Insurance, and now I mean it.Safety Insurance, we are breaking up.  Your crappy customer service, your shitty hours, and your incompetent agents just aren't cutting it anymore.  It's not me.  It's definitely you.

We have Safety Insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance.  Unfortunately, we have had to file claims under both policies.  In 2009, our homeowner's claim was to cover damage from a storm.  The claim representative was very polite, compassionate, and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week.  The house was fixed, we were happy, and life went on.  That experience is the only reason why this is a 2-star review.Safety Insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance.  With a great credit score, a perfect driving record, and a newer vehicle, they offered me a great deal and I signed on.  All was good until I was rear-ended on my way to work one morning.  My phone call to Safety Insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with "Sorry, we don't have any claims representatives right now.  But you can leave a message."  At that point, I should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car, back up, and plow right through me.  Because had I known what I know now, getting hit again by a 1996 Chevy Astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with Safety.  When the Butterball Turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company, you know you're in trouble.As an educated individual, I know that insurance companies really don't care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident.  They want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you don't lawyer-up.  Insurance companies make money.  That is their business.As a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company, I was treated as if I was a felon.  Phone calls went unanswered.  Emails were transferred to clueless representatives.  "We'll get back to you."  Yeah right, and the checks are in the mail.  The accident was in September 2012 and it wasn't resolved until May 2013.  That's 8 months!  It wasn't until I left a scathing Facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me.  In conclusion:  yes, their rates as a good driver are very competitive.  However, Safety Insurance is only good until you need them.  Claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude.  Even as the "victim" your only effective way of getting compensated for your out-of-pocket costs from an accident are to lawyer-up.I can think of a million other things I'd rather do than have to call Safety Insurance when there is an emergency and I need help.  In fact, I'm fairly positive I'd get more help from an ex-boyfriend that I broke up with via a text-message than the help I got from Safety.

I am really surprised by the poor reviews here, as I had a fantastic experience with Safety Insurance. And, let's be honest, to be thrilled with how everything worked out after you've rear-ended someone and crumpled the front end of your car MUST mean someone else did something right. I went directly to the VIP Claims Center in Newton - which was still open after 6pm. Everyone there was super helpful and friendly (thanks, Don!). I was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day. Although I was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs (including a holiday), I got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked AMAZING. The garage that Safety used in Needham did a great job. I will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and I suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary - but - it didn't come out of my pocket, and that is the point of insurance. Overall, a really great experience and I'm sad that I will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation. They really came through for me during a stressful event!

Reading some of the other (negative) reviews gave me pause. But I must say, I had a positive experience with Safety Insurance. I have a Homeowner's policy with Safety and this past winter, the water pipes in my home froze while I was away. When I returned home, I discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom, flowing through the upstairs floor, cascading into my downstairs kitchen. A water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house. The water may well have been running for days. A large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked. There wasn't a room that was untouched. It was truly a disaster. Reconstruction took nearly 5 months. However, Safety was there for me. They investigated the claim and the underlying cause -- which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace. They appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement -- which was substantial. At the end of the day, reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures! Throughout the ordeal, my claims representative was patient, professional and responsive. I admit, there were some nervous moments early on, while I awaited the results of the claim investigation, but in the end, Safety came through and fullfilled their commitment. Moreover, I believe their reconstruction estimate/appraisal was fair, even generous. My house had antique, quarter-sawn pine floors. They were very expensive to replace, and yet, Safety stepped up and paid the full cost. They also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliances...and all the rest.  Yeah, it was a huge ordeal, something I never ever want to go through again. But for me, Safety Insurance saved the day. They did, in a professional and timely manner, what an insurance company is designed to do: protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event.Well done Safety. And THANKS!

I've used Safety since 2004 or so, my girlfriend and I both have auto policies with them and a home owner's policy. I've had to use the auto policy two times, and the claims were processed without issue. I will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid, my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so I have nothing really bad to say.Thankfully, I haven't had to use the homeowner's policy. My brother has used them for a homeowner's claim and there were no problems.

Stay far far away from this company!!!!!!!!! They are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement. If your car is involved in a hit and run forget it !! Don't even bother reporting it to them. My vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where I was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they "hired" stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged. That is completely impossible when I was at work all day. They do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident. I have been a customer for years! Paid on time and only filed ONE CLAIM !!! and I wasn't even driving the car in that previous accident. I will fight this till the end because I know that they want to avoid paying out and I will bring this to court if I have to.

Never do business with Safety Insurance. If you are on the road, pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers.Although Safety Insurance will move your claim along quickly, they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims.I was actually hit by one of their drivers. The man swore he was an honest person and told me that I was in his blind spot. However, he was a liar and told the estimator false information. Although I cannot blame the clientele that Safety insurers entirely upon them, I can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their non-drivers.I specifically asked the claim's adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side, in case there was a dispute. He told me we outsource that to an estimator, and it is their driver's word against mine on damages. So he would not need pictures. When I got an estimate I asked the claim's adjuster for next steps. He told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages. I went to the auto body shop, they agreed with the estimate from the assessors, and that I would need to go through the insurance company for the rental.Upon double-checking the rental policy with Safety, I found that they said they where 50% liable. Complete non-sense. I then had to send them pictures of the skid marks, pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story point-by-point.The claim's adjuster could have saved me a lot of time, by just telling me that they found me 50% liable, when I asked him about next steps. They are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least. If you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police. If the police will not show-up take detailed pictures of the accident and car. Safety will do what ever they can, not to pay you.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. Thankfully, I don't have Safety Insurance, however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me 10 months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasn't the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration (and ultimately losing), I'm still waiting to get reimbursed for my out-of-pocket expenses. The the person on my case at Safety was Matt Kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls, until 2 weeks ago when he asked his colleague, Maureen Miller, to follow up with me. Now I'm being ignored by her too. When I call either one of them, they don't answer, nor do they respond to emails, so safe to say that Safety Insurance has terrible customer service. Heads up - even if I'm not a current customer of yours, you should still provide a high level of service because I could one day decide to switch providers. Not now of course, but I'm also not recommending you to any friends or family.

My experience with safety has been frustrating. My claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails. What kind of adjuster doesn't respond to clients? I had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of.

I was a long time Safety Ins customer, but because their homeowner's ins rates were climbing, I decided to switch insurers. I found a new agency, and Safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank. Everything was done properly a full month before my policy with Safety expired. It has been a year since the switch and Safety will not let me go! They have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that no-one authorized it! I have called, written, and checked to be sure that the bank didn't somehow authorize a continued policy through Safety. No-one at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy, yet Safety refuses to stop billing me. Everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and Safety did too. Do not ever contract with Safety, unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe.
