Total revenues for the third quarter were $1.1 million, down from $2.0 million in the prior-year period due to the decline in oil prices, lower oil production and the absence of AERO Services Segment project revenues.

This compares to a reported third quarter 2015 net loss of $1.3 million, or a loss of $0.04 per basic and diluted common share reported last year. The reduced net loss was driven by a 43% decline in overall operating expenses between the periods. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was a negative $748,000, compared to a negative $968,000 for the third quarter of 2015. EBITDA loss was $1.6 million against EBITDA of $0.4 million reported last year. Adjusted net loss was $1.9 million or $0.06 per share against $3.05 million or $1.10 per share reported last year. Loss from operations was $2.2 million against $3.9 million reported last year. Net loss before taxes on income was $2.5 million against $1.3 million reported last year.

For the nine months, the company reported net loss of $9.1 million or $0.28 per basic and diluted share on total revenue of $3.55 million compared to net loss of $9.2 million or $0.29 per basic and diluted share on total revenue of $7.2 million reported in the same period last year. Adjusted net loss was $6.35 million or $0.20 per share against $9.6 million or $0.30 per share reported last year. Loss from operations was $7.9 million against $11.1 million reported last year. Net loss before taxes on income was $9.1 million against $9.4 million reported last year. EBITDA loss was $6.5 million against EBITDA of $4.3 million reported last year. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $2.9 million against $3.5 million reported last year. Net cash used in operating activities was $4.2 million against $7.7 million reported last year. Purchase of and additions to proved oil and gas property was $1.3 million against $5 million reported last year. Purchase of other property and equipment was $0.2 million against $0.6 million reported last year. 

Total production in the third quarter of 2016 was 27,688 BOE, a decrease of 4.5% from second quarter 2016 production, primarily due to production down-time due to periodic field maintenance. Third quarter 2015 production was 483 net BOE/D, with an average realized oil price of $42.44. Total oil production in the third quarter of 2016 decreased versus a year ago due primarily to shutting in certain uneconomic wells in order to reduce operating expenses.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Glori Energy Inc Com (NASDAQ:GLRI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Glori Energy Begins AERO Technology Field Injection at its Coke Field

Jul 13, 2015, 07:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Glori Energy Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


HOUSTON, July 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Glori Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:   GLRI), an energy technology and oil production company focused on enhanced oil recovery using its proprietary AERO System, announced today that it has commenced the nutrient injection phase of AERO implementation at its Coke Field in Wood County, Texas.
"This is a significant mile marker for our company, as we commence AERO field deployment at our first major Glori-owned and operated oil field," said Stuart Page, Glori President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Based on performance data from AERO client projects, we expect to observe the initial responses at the Coke Field within two to four months."
Glori's patented AERO system, which was developed in collaboration with Statoil of Norway, works by injecting a proprietary mix of nutrients into water drive or waterflood sandstone reservoirs.  The nutrients "feed" and stimulate microorganisms living in the reservoir, and their increased activity improves the water sweep and the flow of oil through the reservoir to the wellbore. AERO technology has been commercially deployed by Glori with various exploration and production clients in the U.S. and Canada and with Petrobras in Brazil. 
The Coke Field is part of Glori's ongoing strategy to acquire mature producing oil properties that have significant amounts of remaining oil and advantageous characteristics for the AERO System to increase production and recover that residual oil. Typically only one-third of oil discovered in a reservoir is recoverable using conventional technologies; Glori's unique microbial enhanced oil recovery technology can potentially recover an additional 20% of the remaining oil at a cost of less than $10 per incremental barrel produced.  
"We will initially implement AERO at the Coke Field utilizing a recently drilled injection well. Ultimately, we expect to utilize up to five injectors to maximize production and oil recovery," Page said.  "The next injection well is currently scheduled for the fourth quarter, with the remaining injectors planned for 2016. Once fully implemented, we believe AERO will ultimately yield an additional 7 million barrels of oil over the life of the field through a combination of decreasing the existing decline curve and increasing production," he said.
ABOUT GLORI ENERGY INC.
Glori Energy is a Houston-based energy technology and oil production company that deploys its proprietary AERO technology to increase the amount of oil that can be produced from conventional oil fields. Glori owns and operates oil fields onshore U.S. and additionally provides its technology as a service to E&P companies globally. Only one-third of all oil discovered in a typical reservoir is recoverable using conventional technologies; the rest remains trapped in the rock. Glori's proprietary AERO System recovers residual oil by stimulating a reservoir's native microorganisms to sustainably increase the ultimate recovery at a low cost.  For more information, visit www.GloriEnergy.com.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Oil Production









              "Glori Energy is a Houston-based energy technology and oil production company that deploys its proprietary AERO(TM) System to increase the amount of oil that can be produced from conventional oil fields. Glori owns and operates oil fields onshore U.S. and additionally provides its technology as a service to E&P companies globally. Only one-third of all oil discovered in a typical reservoir is recoverable using conventional technologies; the rest remains trapped in the rock. Glori's proprietary AERO System recovers residual oil by stimulating a reservoir's native microorganisms to sustainably increase the ultimate recovery at a low cost". From the LinkedIn Profile.
            






Glori Energy is a tiny oil production company which also has a proprietary technology (AERO)  for enhancing flow from wells. The Company has been around since 2005 and is public, which results in substantial financial disclosure. However, the Company is on its last legs due to the oil price drop, and de-leveraging the balance sheet. IIIQ 2016 results had quarterly sales at $1.1mn and Adjusted EBITDA at ($0.75mn). The AERO technology did not bring in a dime of revenue in the quarter. Most of the remaining resources of the Company-and management-are focused on funding and opening a new Phoenix oil field to demonstrate the AERO technology in action, and an ongoing effort to raise capital from the Department of Energy. Hope springs eternal but with cash down to under $2mn and no other existing funding source, the picture is bleak.

Two BDCs have exposure to the Company, aggregating just under $2mn. Hercules Capital (HTGC) has a small common stock investment of $165,000, left over from a larger financing provided years ago. Stellus Capital (SCM) has a $1.6mn stake in the Company's $10mn Term Loan that matures in March 2017 and is secured by oil wells. That's been worked down-thanks to repayments-from close to $3mn. The common has been written down to zero and any recovery is highly unlikely. SCM's debt,though, is carried at close to par thanks to the collateral involved. No material loss is expected.

The BDC Credit Reporter has a Corporate Credit Rating of 4 on Glori because- despite its ever-worsening business and financial conditions- obligations have been met. Still the credit trend is down for the Company after reviewing the November 9th 2016 financial statements even if the impact on the two BDCs involved might be negligible. Bankruptcy seems almost certain.
