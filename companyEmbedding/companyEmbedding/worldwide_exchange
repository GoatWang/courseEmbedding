The Worldwide Exchange - Mobile Digital Application Developer    Cobo - 'Carry On Baggage Only dAtinG'where Women find the men who love them!​Every Relationship has baggage, now you can list your baggage and someone can claim it!                                                            'What a great way to start' The key to this business is to get the single or seeking women to want to post on your app. They say fun and honesty is what they are looking for. With the right marketing plan, we could have over 1 million users in 6 months of the start of the marketing campaign. That would put us in a position to deliver over $1 million dollars per month in revenue with a profitability of over 90% minus Apple's fee for allowing us to display and distribute our Cobo App on the App Store Platform. This is the investment you have been waiting for all your life. With that kind of production, a possible 'Billion Dollar' valuation is just around the corner. If you think that the commercial we present could get women to sign up for the Cobo experience, this is a done deal and a smart and courageous investors has just found his or her pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. You can have fun and start off a relationship by telling someone that you want a 'baby' and know that that person is willing to consider that or really wants that too. Cobo - Carry on Baggage Only' dating is a new dating app that allows women to choose from a list of 'true feelings & desires' and to searched and picked by that and a profile picture. The men list themselves as baggage handlers and express how they would deal with the real things that make up love and life. It allows you to start off 'honestly' about the things we hide and people find out. This way, when you go on a date, every thing is out front and it only get's better from there. This is our powerhouse product. Cobo will drive this company to a billion-dollar valuation, with millions of dollars of revenue per month.  The potential upside in dating applications for mobile is really beyond our dreams as investors, but being apart of The Worldwide Exchange and Cobo brings those dreams to earth and can make it real for those who are smart enough to jump on board this moving train. In all of our lifetimes,  we often hope to find that ‘thing’ that fills a human need, that thing that the public can’t quite get enough of. We all know that the smartphone has taken over all of our lives, and is by definition, ‘The Greatest Sells’ device ever invented. If any one makes a product that can be accessed on a smartphone that solves a human need, then that product becomes ‘Priceless’ and the ‘gold’ of our century.Cobo is that product. If you haven't noticed, the dating business  has risen to the level of a madness. There are clients everywhere, everyday, all the time. And we have  the right product to fill that void. Cobo is perfect. It allows a customer to start off Honestly! You don't have to fill out a 2 hour form. You don't get told who you need to love. You can state as much or as little as your heart desires. It's like health care should be. Cobo is the epitome of choice, affordable,  only mandated by your participation and need, with a funny and loving way to accommodate all of our pre-existing conditions. The business model is net revenue positive. Our company spent years developing a website for video classified ads and eventually made it an app. It is robust, friendly, and a great product to drive small business and individual advertising in the 21st century. Then one night about a year ago, some friends and I were out to dinner and having margaritas and laughing about how all relationships have baggage and everyone in relationships have some level of crazy in them. However, no one in the group could name a single dating site or application that was built to show the baggage or deal with the upfront, upfront. We all agreed that people with baggage, all of us, need a dating app that allows you to start off honestly and continue from that level.. Voila, we decided that an app that allowed one bag or a carry-on bag to enter a dating relationship needed to be invented. :).  Hence, Cobo - Carry On Baggage Only Dating App!I was the only one who went home and started working on it immediately. The idea is that a woman can sign up for free, create a profile for free, upload an image for free, and then select ‘One Bag’ that self describes her situation, her crazy, or her desire. Hopefully, the one that is most honest and reflects why she is motivated to consider being on a dating app in the first place. I created choices like, ‘My bag wants a baby!’. Probably the most honest statement of all and something no dating app really has a check box for. There are 13 other choices and more coming. Now the men are ‘Baggage Handlers’ . As they search the profiles of women, they see the image and touch a button to see the description of the chosen ‘Carry-on Bag’ as an overlay. If the fellow likes what he sees and is willing to carry that bag, he hits a button to ‘Claim’ that bag and then he sees her total profile statement, where she can explain herself in even more honest detail. At that point, he can choose to save that profile and then choose to contact her for chat, by hitting the 'let's chat' button.Woman may also search and find ‘Baggage Handlers’ and check their self-described way of handling baggage and then 'Assign' them to be a carrier, save his profile, and initiate contact via chat. One of the baggage handler overlays says, ‘Heavy bags don’t scarce me,  I’m a big boy”. That is in response to the carry-on bag that says, ‘My bag has kids, keys, credit cards, candy, and kaos in it, it’s heavy!’ We get a big laugh out of that one! When they finally decide to start chatting, they click an In-App Purchase pop-up, enter their Apple ID and click purchase. Once the Apple ID is verified, the client is instantly billed by Apple our purchase price of $.99 cents for 30 days of unlimited universal chat. That means they can talk to as many people for as long as they want for 30 days. With our current app configuration, using cloud hosting services, allows us to host 125,000,000 accounts and provide 30 days of chat for a monthly cost of $400. We are net revenue positive, because we don't have to provide anything that cost money, until a customer demands the product, and when they demand the product, we get paid! A cash heavy business, with a subscription model, 80% net against cost for delivery, on a smartphone equals a billion dollar valuation.This unique way of approaching the process of finding love has tested nothing short of amazing. At this point we are moving away from friends and family and looking to allow a small group of investors and or an institution to provide us with the final financing we need to promote & market this product in Los Angeles California, as our primary launch. If you can make it in Los Angeles, the world will follow.  It is the prescription the world is waiting for, as told to us by the women we have tested the product. They laugh and cry with joy as they see the bags that they can choose; while imagining how much fun it will be to be searched by that. The most consistent theme expressed by each woman was that this app gives you a chance to start the experience off with honesty. They say that that is worth every penny they could ever spend on finding love.

							Microsoft Volume Licensing programs.On this page: PT | OST | SPUR | SLA | ISVProduct TermsBeginning in July 2015, a new document called the Product Terms replaces both the Product Use Rights and the Product List. Together with the program agreement, Product Terms contains all the terms and conditions for how you purchase licenses for software and online services through Microsoft Volume Licensing programs, with the exception of the Microsoft Online Subscription and Cloud Solution Provider programs, as well as how you may deploy and use software licensed under those programs. Information on how to deploy and use Online Services continues to be found in the Online Services Terms (OST) for all programs. Now in one document, Product Terms provides the same information regarding availability of new products, discontinuation products, available promotions, point values, product migration paths, notes and other information specific to products. The consolidation, along with enhanced navigation, makes it easier to understand how to buy and use Microsoft products without diminishing your product use rights. The Product Terms document is updated monthly. The current and archived editions of Product Terms are available for download. For more information, read the Product Terms FAQ.

The floor of the Chicago Board of Trade, a major commodities exchange in the United States.


Main article: Commodity market
A commodities exchange is an exchange where various commodities and derivatives products are traded. Most commodity markets across the world trade in agricultural products and other raw materials (like wheat, barley, sugar, maize, cotton, cocoa, coffee, milk products, pork bellies, oil, metals, etc.) and contracts based on them. These contracts can include spot prices, forwards, futures and options on futures. Other sophisticated products may include interest rates, environmental instruments, swaps, or ocean freight contracts.
Commodities exchanges usually trade futures contracts on commodities, such as trading contracts to receive something, say corn, in a certain month. A farmer raising corn can sell a future contract on his corn, which will not be harvested for several months, and guarantee the price he will be paid when he delivers; a breakfast cereal producer buys the contract now and guarantees the price will not go up when it is delivered. This protects the farmer from price drops and the buyer from price rises.
Speculators and investors also buy and sell the futures contracts in attempt to make a profit and provide liquidity to the system. However, due to the financial leverage provided to traders by the exchange, commodity futures traders face a substantial risk.[1]

List of countries by GDP (nominal)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

For countries by purchasing power parity GDP, see List of countries by GDP (PPP).







Largest economies by nominal GDP in 2017
(counting the economies of the European Union as one)
according to International Monetary Fund estimates.[1]






The United States, the world's largest economy, accounts for approximately 25 percent of Nominal world GDP, and the seven largest economies (amalgamating the European Union economies as one) account for 75 percent of the total.


Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year.[2] Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]
Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem, but has its own drawbacks; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than nominal GDP.[5] On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[6]
The United States is the world's largest economy with a GDP of approximately $18.56 trillion, notably due to high average incomes, a large population,[7] capital investment, moderate unemployment,[8] high consumer spending,[9] a relatively young population,[10] and technological innovation.[11] Tuvalu is the world's smallest national economy with a GDP of about $32 million because of its very small population, a lack of natural resources, reliance on foreign aid, negligible capital investment, demographic problems, and low average incomes.[12]
Although the rankings of national economies have changed considerably over time, the United States has maintained its top position since the Gilded Age, a time period in which its economy saw rapid expansion, surpassing the British Empire and Qing dynasty in aggregate output.[13][14] Since China's transition to a market-based economy through privatisation and deregulation,[15][16] the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978 to second to only the United States in 2016 as economic growth accelerated and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 15% in 2016.[14][1] India has also experienced a similar economic boom since the implementation of neoliberal reforms in the early 1990s.[17] When supranational entities are included, the European Union is the second largest economy in the world. It was the largest from 2004, when ten countries joined the union,[18] to 2014, after which it was surpassed by the United States.[19]
The first list largely includes data compiled by the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook for 2016, the second list shows the World Bank's 2016 estimates, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division for 2015. Several economies which are not considered to be countries (the world, the European Union, and some dependent territories) are included in the lists because they appear in the sources as distinct economies. These economies are italicized and not ranked in the charts, but are listed where applicable.
