                           worldwide
                           Prof. William Sherrill remarked that a class in Entrepreneurship is taught in the College of Business Administration. It is
                              a new field of study. The term has been used loosely over the years. A definition of Entrepreneur is a person who develops
                              new ideas, or a new twist on an old idea, and turns this idea into productivity and a growing business. Three basic elements
                              are: 1) productivity; 2) innovation; and 3) growth. Growth management is the hardest part of management planning. A small
                              business is not an entrepreneurship because it does not seek continual growth. Growth management requires extensive business
                              planning. There is one entrepreneur to each business enterprise. The three basic rules for an entrepreneur are: 1) focus on
                              customer satisfaction; 2) keep a sharp turnaround time; and 3) always give the customer value. The seven steps for establishing
                              the entrepreneur's business are: 1) find a good idea and refine it; 2) estimate revenues; 3) estimate costs; 4) check for
                              satisfactory profit, change idea if profit not satisfactory; 5) do a business plan; 6) perfect a single operating unit; and
                              7) multiply units as a basis for growth. Prof. Keith Cox then spoke briefly about the academic program. Out of an entrepreneurship
                              class of 150 students, 30 are selected to complete the Program in Entrepreneurship. Prof. Larry J. Sachnowith, of Sachnowith
                              & Co., stated that entrepreneurs are lonely people. They have to think differently and be able to handle risk. The entrepreneur
                              needs to ask himself: 1) are there customers for his product or service; 2) is he ready to serve those customers; and 3) is
                              he sure about the customer. Customers cannot be fooled

                              covers the topics taught in an entrepreneurship course as they relate to revenue, cost, and capital. Students are encouraged
                              to understand business from the point of view of the Chief Executive Officer.-http://www.atomicdogpublishing.com

Drape
We love fabric. Desperately. 
In fact, we are known nationwide for having a jaw dropping, heart pounding selection of the world’s finest fabrics. Fabric lovers travel hundreds of miles. To choose from over 4,ooo bolts of silk, linen, velvet, mohair, suede & cotton textiles.
To peruse our dizzying selection of patterns from paisleys and florals to plaids and stripes . With thousands of luxurious fabrics, design consultants on site, and a custom workroom we provide endless options for creating your space.

Lounge
It’s a simple fact. Life requires places to lounge. Cozy chairs for reading are essential. Plush sofas for snuggling and watching old movies are indispensable. Ottomans for resting tired feet are vital. (We know this. We work in retail.) 
Whether your heart yearns for handsome leather club chairs, a cool and clean lined sofa, or a pretty floral covered armchair, this is the place to find it.
Work on your own, with our designers, or yours, to create perfectly customized upholstery. We only carry the finest custom furniture lines. With eight way hand tied, kiln dried hardwood frames, the upholstery offered here will endure a lifetime of napping, lingering and unwinding. 
Countless cushion and fabric options from linens and silks to chenille and brocades provide endless possibilities for crafting the spot you’ve been dreaming about.

Be Bold
“Fortune favors the bold” 
              Virgil, Roman epic poet
We are tremendous fans of this particular notion. In design, and certainly, in life, Boldness goes a long way. So, Express yourself passionately. Don’t be faint of heart. 
Paper that tiny powder room with a large and dramatic pattern. 
  Choosing something unexpected will transform it into a spectacular jewel box, independent from the rest of your home. Welcome friends and family into a foyer covered with a rich tone on tone damask.  
Trust us, the candlelight reflected in the pattern will take your breath away. Create shadow play in your sun room by papering the ceiling with an organic leafy pattern. It will feel like you are reading the Sunday papers beneath the canopy of a beautiful tree. Forge a handsome study with a woven grasscloth. Soften the walls of an inviting airy bedroom with a pastoral pistachio toile. 
Live Boldly. We’re sure you won’t regret it.
 




Sleep
We never have been, and probably never will be, subtle or restrained when it comes to bedding. In this regard we feel, quite passionately, that less is never more. We believe, most fervently, in the restorative powers of sleeping on down, silk, satin, chenille, velvet, cashmere, linen and finely woven cotton. In short, the more obscenely luxurious and decadent we can make your bed the better.
Therefore, we obsessively carry the finest linens and beds available allowing us to sleep soundly at night. We would toss and turn if we thought our customers were not resting comfortably.
(We also highly value silk, satin, chenille, linen and velvet loungewear for bedtime.  Sleep tight.)



Organize 
Life requires stuff, and stuff requires storage. We all need cabinets for televisions, coffee tables for playing scrabble, bookshelves for novels, side tables for reading lamps, armoires for storing linens, & dining tables for feasting and celebrating. 
Whether your style is serious or playful, modern or traditional, we have the case goods to organize and complement your life. 



Embellish 
Beaded or Brush? Braided or Bullion? The options for trimming your window treatments and pillows (seat cushions, waste baskets, lamp shades…) are only limited by your imagination. Because we adore embellishment, we have over one thousand bolts of trim
   in countless sumptuous colors. (Who said less is more?) 
Whether your style is formal or casual, sophisticated or sassy, traditional or eclectic we have the tassel, ribbon or button trim for your home.

Search Tips
Phrase Searching
Use quotes to search an exact phrase: e.g. "occult fiction"
Wildcards
Use * or ? to search for alternate forms of a
word. Use * to stand for several characters, and ? for a single
character: e.g. optim* will find optimal, optimize or optimum; wom?n
will find woman and women. 
Boolean Searching
Use AND and OR between words to combine
them with Boolean logic: e.g. (heart OR cardiac) AND surgery will find
items about heart surgery or cardiac surgery. Boolean terms must be in
uppercase.
