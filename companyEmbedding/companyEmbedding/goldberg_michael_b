introduction




                ichael B. Goldberg is a founding partner of Goldberg Weisman Cairo and is a leading Illinois Personal injury and Workers’ Compensation attorney. Michael graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1974 where he was the Assistant Business Manager of the DePaul Law Review. He began his legal career with the Illinois Attorney General’s office as an Assistant Attorney General in the Illinois Industrial Commission Division. While there, Michael concentrated exclusively in Workers’ Compensation litigation, where he represented the State of Illinois in Workers’ Compensation matters. In 1977, recognizing that most Workers Compensation attorneys did not handle third-party cases, Michael formed a partnership with Larry Weisman, a law school classmate who concentrated in third-party personal injury cases. Since 1977 GWC, with its 33 attorneys, has grown into one of the largest, most successful and most prestigious personal injury law firms in Illinois and the country.

The firm concentrates exclusively in representing individuals and families who have been injured in accidents and is well-known throughout Illinois. Michael believes that every client deserves to be treated with the utmost personal attention and respect. The firm’s extensive resources, resulting from their unparalleled success, allow them to stand up to large insurance companies and their large law firms. Michael attributes much of the firm’s success to the many satisfied clients that GWC has had the privilege of representing.

                                        Verdicts & Settlements
Representative Settlements and Verdicts:

$13.73 Million — Laborer. Suffered extensive burns over 80% of his body. An ensuing legal battle continued for more than five years against one of the country’s largest utilities.

Amount Confidential between public demand of $13 Million and rejected offer of $6 Million — Foster mother of nine was killed and her niece incurred a partial paraplegia injury when a van they were riding in rolled over multiple times. Vehicle stability testing conducted by the auto manufacturer and supporting documents became the proof that was necessary to secure a landmark “confidential” settlement against one of the largest automakers in the world.

$10.73 Million — Settlement on behalf of the residents of a Chicago neighborhood exposed to toxic smoke from the ACME Barrel facility. 

$10 Million — Carpenter killed in 100 foot fall into Elevator pit. (Settlement paid 17 months after the accident)

$10 Million — Ironworker. Fell from a one-story roof and was rendered a partial quadriplegic. The case ultimately proceeded to trial after over 50 depositions were taken around the country in order to establish liability upon the two manufacturers of the pre-fabricated metal building that contained excessive amounts of oil on the decking sheets and were responsible for his slip and fall off of the roof iron.

$8.5 Million — Carpenter.  Killed when he was struck by a beam after a wall collapsed.  This case was contested throughout its pendency and settled on the eve of trial.

$6.3 Million — Electrician.  Killed after sustaining burns in a switchgear explosion.  GWC obtained this jury award after an arduous 4-year investigation and was able to provide the electrician's widow with the financial security that she deserved.  Click here to find out more information about this case.

introduction




                ichael B. Goldberg is a founding partner of Goldberg Weisman Cairo and is a leading Illinois Personal injury and Workers’ Compensation attorney. Michael graduated from DePaul University Law School in 1974 where he was the Assistant Business Manager of the DePaul Law Review. He began his legal career with the Illinois Attorney General’s office as an Assistant Attorney General in the Illinois Industrial Commission Division. While there, Michael concentrated exclusively in Workers’ Compensation litigation, where he represented the State of Illinois in Workers’ Compensation matters. In 1977, recognizing that most Workers Compensation attorneys did not handle third-party cases, Michael formed a partnership with Larry Weisman, a law school classmate who concentrated in third-party personal injury cases. Since 1977 GWC, with its 33 attorneys, has grown into one of the largest, most successful and most prestigious personal injury law firms in Illinois and the country.

The firm concentrates exclusively in representing individuals and families who have been injured in accidents and is well-known throughout Illinois. Michael believes that every client deserves to be treated with the utmost personal attention and respect. The firm’s extensive resources, resulting from their unparalleled success, allow them to stand up to large insurance companies and their large law firms. Michael attributes much of the firm’s success to the many satisfied clients that GWC has had the privilege of representing.

                                        Verdicts & Settlements
Representative Settlements and Verdicts:

$13.73 Million — Laborer. Suffered extensive burns over 80% of his body. An ensuing legal battle continued for more than five years against one of the country’s largest utilities.

Amount Confidential between public demand of $13 Million and rejected offer of $6 Million — Foster mother of nine was killed and her niece incurred a partial paraplegia injury when a van they were riding in rolled over multiple times. Vehicle stability testing conducted by the auto manufacturer and supporting documents became the proof that was necessary to secure a landmark “confidential” settlement against one of the largest automakers in the world.

$10.73 Million — Settlement on behalf of the residents of a Chicago neighborhood exposed to toxic smoke from the ACME Barrel facility. 

$10 Million — Carpenter killed in 100 foot fall into Elevator pit. (Settlement paid 17 months after the accident)

$10 Million — Ironworker. Fell from a one-story roof and was rendered a partial quadriplegic. The case ultimately proceeded to trial after over 50 depositions were taken around the country in order to establish liability upon the two manufacturers of the pre-fabricated metal building that contained excessive amounts of oil on the decking sheets and were responsible for his slip and fall off of the roof iron.

$8.5 Million — Carpenter.  Killed when he was struck by a beam after a wall collapsed.  This case was contested throughout its pendency and settled on the eve of trial.

$6.3 Million — Electrician.  Killed after sustaining burns in a switchgear explosion.  GWC obtained this jury award after an arduous 4-year investigation and was able to provide the electrician's widow with the financial security that she deserved.  Click here to find out more information about this case.

Louis C. Cairo





 




          Louis is a senior partner at GWC. Growing up the son of an Italian immigrant who owned a union construction company in Northern Illinois, Louis acquired considerable experience and respect for the men and women working in the construction industry.

His warm family upbringing has played a significant part in developing Louis reputation as an compassionate, aggressive trial lawyer in the representation of severely injured individuals, and families suffering the loss of a loved one in wrongful death cases.

Louis graduated from Marquette University with a Business Degree and then received his law degree at Loyola University School of Law in Chicago in 1983. He is a distinguished member of:

Board of Managers in the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association
Justinian Society of Italian Lawyers
Society of Trial Lawyers
American Association for Justice
Chicago Bar Association
Illinois State Bar Association
Louis has earned the distinction of being honored with the:

Italian American Labor Councils Person of the Year Award
Leonardo da Vinci Award of Excellence in the Law by the National Grand Lodge of the Order Sons of Italy
Italian American Executive of Transportation Councils Man of the Year
Louis will be honored, once again, with the Man of the Year award from the Italian American Executives of Transportation Council in November of 2013.

Louis has consistently been honored with the distinction of being named to the Leading Lawyers Network and to the list of Illinois Superlawyers.

I pride myself, and my law firm, on being the champion for the little guy. At GWC, we wouldnt have it any other way.
Louis has lectured extensively to attorneys through the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association and speaks regularly to building trades members concerning their legal rights.

His experience as a personal injury trial lawyer includes representing clients that have sustained traumatic brain injury, paralysis, multiple fractures, amputation of a limb and wrongful death. He has successfully tried cases involving construction negligence, product liability, trucking accident fatalities, Federal Employer Liability Act cases, automobile accidents, slip and falls and other types of catastrophic injuries.

Louis has always loved the challenge of taking on a difficult case, or trying a lawsuit in an area that tends to be a conservative venue. Routinely, defense attorneys will say This isnt Cook County, Louis. Youll never get that kind of money in our county. That has been a challenged that he has responded to by procuring numerous record verdicts and settlements throughout the state. In fact, a few years back, his law firm had more $1 million PLUS settlements outside of Cook County than any other law firm in Illinois; and Louis personally had more than any other lawyer in the state.

Maximizing the value of his clients cases has always been important to him. Louis is very proud that over the years he has established record verdicts and settlements in many counties throughout Illinois, including, Lake, Kane, DeKalb, Sycamore and Jo Daviess.

Louis has fought some of the biggest insurance companies, contractors and corporations on behalf of his clients. His clients have always been the Davids versus the Goliaths.

When not practicing law, Louis spends his time with his wife and three adult children.
