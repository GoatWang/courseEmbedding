Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

Esperion Announces Initiation of Phase 2 Study of Bempedoic Acid Added-On to a PCSK9 Inhibitor
Jul 26 17
Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical study (1002-039) to assess the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid when added-on to an injectable proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) therapy. This non-registrational study will assess the incremental LDL-C lowering efficacy and continued safety and tolerability of a once-daily, oral bempedoic acid pill added-on to an injectable biologic therapy in patients with elevated LDL-C levels. Top-line results are expected by the first quarter of 2018. The eight-week, Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily, oral bempedoic acid 180 mg and once-monthly injection of Repatha® (evolocumab) 420 mg versus placebo. The study is expected to enroll approximately 50 patients with hypercholesterolemia at approximately 20 sites across the U.S. The primary objective of the study is to assess the incremental LDL-C lowering efficacy of bempedoic acid versus placebo in patients receiving PCSK9i therapy. Secondary objectives include assessing the safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid versus placebo in patients on PCSK9i therapy and effects on other risk markers, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).

To consider on FDA confirmation of regulatory pathway to approval for the combination of Bempedoic Acid and Ezetimibe


Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. Announces FDA Confirmation of Regulatory Pathway to Approval for the Combination of Bempedoic Acid and Ezetimibe
Jun 26 17
Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently confirmed the regulatory pathway to approval for the once-daily, oral combination pill of bempedoic acid 180 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg. Based on feedback received from the FDA, Esperion plans to initiate a single global pivotal Phase 3 bridging study (1002FDC-053) for the bempedoic acid /ezetimibe combination pill that will be conducted concurrently with the ongoing global pivotal Phase 3 program for bempedoic acid. The Phase 3 bridging study will support approval for an LDL-C lowering indication in both the U.S. and Europe. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is expected to enroll up to 350 patients with hypercholesterolemia and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), including high cardiovascular risk primary prevention patients, whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the bempedoic acid /ezetimibe combination, a convenient, cost-effective, once-daily, oral pill. Additional design details for this study will be provided upon initiation by the fourth quarter of 2017, with top-line results expected by the end of 2018. In tandem with the NDA submission for bempedoic acid, the company plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for an LDL-C lowering indication for the bempedoic acid /ezetimibe combination through the available abbreviated 505(b)(2) pathway by the first half of 2019. The company also expects to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for an LDL-C lowering indication for the bempedoic acid /ezetimibe combination, consistent with the European Medicines Agency Guideline on Clinical Development of Fixed Combination Medicinal Products,in tandem with the MAA submission for bempedoic acid by the first half of 2019.

Esperion | The Lipid Management Company | Bempedoic Acid



































 


















Bempedoic Acid
Bempedoic acid is a convenient, complementary, cost-effective, oral, once-daily LDL-C lowering drug that significantly reduces elevated LDL-C levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia, including patients inadequately treated with current lipid-modifying therapies. Bempedoic acid, a novel, non-statin, targeted therapy, works in the liver to block cholesterol biosynthesis.
In the liver, bempedoic acid is converted to a coenzyme A (CoA) derivative, or ETC-1002-CoA, which directly inhibits ATP citrate lyase (ACL), a key enzyme that supplies substrate for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the liver. Inhibition of ACL by ETC-1002-CoA results in reduced cholesterol synthesis and upregulation of LDL receptor activity in the liver. This promotes the removal of LDL-C from the blood.
To date, Esperion has studied bempedoic acid in eighteen completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies, and is currently evaluating bempedoic acid in four global pivotal Phase 3 LDL-C lowering efficacy and safety studies and one cardiovascular outcomes trial.

*Average LDL-C % change from baseline (placebo corrected)

Phase 2 Clinical Study Results
Our completed Phase 2 clinical studies have demonstrated significant LDL-C reductions of up to 30% as monotherapy, almost 50% in combination with ezetimibe, and an incremental 20%+ on top of any statin at any dose. Bempedoic acid also consistently lowers high sensitivity C-reactive protein, or hsCRP, an important marker of the underlying inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease.
Across eighteen completed clinical studies, bempedoic acid has displayed consistent and compelling, positive clinical results.
Initially, we intend to seek approval of bempedoic acid in the U.S. and Europe for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) with elevated levels of LDL-C not adequately controlled with current lipid-modifying therapies. Some patients with elevated LDL-C are only able to tolerate less than the lowest approved daily starting dose of a statin and can be considered statin intolerant. We are confident patients, physicians, and payers will welcome a convenient, complementary, cost-effective, once-daily, oral LDL-C lowering therapy, especially the estimated 8 million patients in the U.S., Europe and Japan who are considered statin intolerant, a population with a high level of unmet medical need. In Europe, we are also seeking approval for use of bempedoic acid in statin intolerant patients with elevated LDL-C.
