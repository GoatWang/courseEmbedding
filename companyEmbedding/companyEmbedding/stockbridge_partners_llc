Investment Process

What types of companies interest us?We look for companies that exhibit long-term earnings sustainability and growth potential.We seek opportunities to invest at attractive valuations when circumstances—internal or external to a company—combine to depress its valuation.  These circumstances may reflect short-term concerns, such as industry headwinds, a cyclical low point, a looming regulatory threat, a small but visible strategic misstep or management turnover.  Alternatively, they may reflect a broad-based misunderstanding of a company's healthy fundamentals.  The implications of certain kinds of activities—for example, a recent IPO, spin-off or restructuring—often are not readily recognized by the market in the short term, thereby creating attractive valuations to invest.In other words, a good business tends to remain a good business for a long time, even if its valuation fluctuates in the short run.How do we find these good businesses? We have deep research capabilities, both within Stockbridge and across the broader Berkshire organization.  We have structured ourselves in a way that enables us to allocate significant amounts of time to finding the right opportunity—and to move quickly when that occasion presents itself.

Stockbridge Investors

Stockbridge is an investment group focused on marketable securities.  Under the larger Berkshire Partners umbrella, we seek to make our investments drawing upon the philosophy, resources, rigor and discipline that Berkshire has employed in its over 30 years of private equity investing.  We believe that Stockbridge's investment activities are complementary to Berkshire's longstanding private equity business.We take positions in public securities with a bias toward being long-term investors, focusing on high quality companies that exhibit earnings sustainability and growth.  We accept short-term volatility—and in many cases, view price fluctuations more as opportunities than as risks.Launched in 2007, Stockbridge’s assets under management have grown to over $2.5 billion.
