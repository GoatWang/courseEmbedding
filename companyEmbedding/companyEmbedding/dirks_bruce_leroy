	This entry represents the number of shares of ViaSat, Inc. common stock withheld by the Issuer to satisfy the tax withholding obligation of the Reporting Person.

	(3) 





	The original restricted stock unit grant on 04/26/2013 was for 8,000 restricted stock units. Subject to the reporting person's continued employment with the Issuer, the units vest and convert into shares of common stock of the Issuer at a rate of 1/4 on the 13th month anniversay of the grant date; 1/4 on the second anniversary of the grant date, 1/4th on the third anniversary of the grant date and 1/4th on the fourth anniversary of the grant date.









	(4)
