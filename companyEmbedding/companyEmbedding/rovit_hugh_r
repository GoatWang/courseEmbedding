Ellery Homestyles Announces Formalized CEO Transition Plan



Share Article

















Hugh Rovit, former CEO of Sure Fit, to Succeed Founder Budd Goldman in December 2013.






New York, NY (PRWEB)
May 21, 2013
 Ellery Homestyles, a leading supplier of branded and private label home-fashion products including curtains, bedding, throws and specialty products, has announced that Hugh Rovit will succeed Budd Goldman as 
Chief Executive Officer at the end of calendar year 2013.
Rovit, who joined Ellery on May 20th, served as CEO since April 2006 of Sure Fit Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of ready-made slipcovers, outdoor furniture covers and other home décor products, until the time of its sale in December 2012 to Focus Products Group International.  Goldman founded Ellery in 2000 and will become Co-Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, with a continuing strategic role.
“I met Budd soon after I entered the home furnishings industry and we have enjoyed a great relationship over the years,” Rovit said.  “The chance to join Ellery and help execute on the portfolio of exciting growth strategies he and his team are developing is a fantastic opportunity for me.”
Prior to Sure Fit from 2001 to 2005, Rovit was a principal at a consulting firm focused on operational improvement initiatives.  Previously, he held the positions of Chief Financial Officer of Best Manufacturing, a manufacturer and distributor of institutional service apparel and textiles, from 1998 thru 2001 and Chief Financial Officer of Royce Hosiery Mills, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of men’s and women’s hosiery from 1991 thru 19998.  Rovit currently serves on the board of directors of Spectrum Brands Holdings, a $4 billion publically traded global consumer products company.
“I have known Hugh for many years through the industry and am thrilled to welcome him to Ellery," Goldman said.  “Under his leadership, Sure Fit established itself as a best-in-class business partner to many of the same customers with which we enjoy a similar relationship.   His experience managing the Company’s significant growth during his tenure there will be a tremendous asset as we continue building a leading consumer home products business.”
“When we purchased Ellery in December 2010, we committed to Budd that together we would develop and execute a CEO succession plan that would be right for all of Ellery’s stakeholders,” said Troy Templeton, managing partner of Trivest and majority shareholder of Ellery.  “Hugh is a great fit for the Company and the timing is perfect for he and Budd to work together over the balance of the year to ensure a seamless transition.”
