3, Amendment No. 4, Amendment No. 5, Amendment No. 6, Amendment No. 7, Amendment No. 8 and Amendment No. 9, the “Initial
Schedule 13D”), and is being filed on behalf of Warburg Pincus Private Equity IX, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
(“WP IX”), Warburg Pincus IX GP L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and the general partner of WP IX (“WP
IX GP”), WPP GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner of WP IX GP (“WPP GP”),

may be deemed to control WP IX, WP IX GP, WPP GP, WP Partners, WPP GP LLC, WP and WP LLC. WP IX, WP IX GP, WPP GP, WP Partners,
WPP GP LLC, WP, WP LLC, Mr. Kaye and Mr. Landy are hereinafter referred to as the “Warburg Pincus Reporting Persons”.
The Initial Schedule 13D, as amended by this Amendment No. 11, is being referred to as the “Schedule 13D”. This
Amendment No. 11 relates to the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), of Synutra International,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Issuer”). Information in respect of each Warburg Pincus Reporting Person
is given solely by such Warburg Pincus Reporting Person and no Warburg Pincus Reporting Person has responsibility for the accuracy
or completeness of information supplied by any other Warburg Pincus Reporting Person. All capitalized terms used herein that are
not defined herein have the meanings for such terms set forth in the Initial Schedule 13D.
 
The Warburg Pincus Reporting Persons are
filing this Amendment No. 11 because they sold certain Common Stock shares of the Issuer and are no longer the beneficial owners
of more than five percent of the Common Stock of the Issuer, as described in Item 5. Consequently, their obligation to file a Schedule
13D has terminated with this filing.
 
Unless set forth below, all previous Items
set forth in the Initial Schedule 13D are unchanged.
 


Item 4.
Purpose of Transaction 

 
Item 4 is hereby amended and restated
as follows:
 
On November 2, 2016, WP IX sold an aggregate
of 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Issuer in a block trade at a price per share of $3.45 (without giving effect to brokerage
commissions). As a result of the sale, the Warburg Pincus Reporting Persons disposed of all of their shares of Common Stock of
the Issuer. The sale was undertaken for portfolio management purposes.
 


Item 5. 
Interest in Securities of the Issuer

 
Item 5 is hereby amended and restated as
follows:
 
(a) – (b) As a result of the transaction
disclosed in Item 4 herein, the Warburg Pincus Reporting Persons no longer own any securities of the Issuer or have sole or shared
power to vote, direct the vote, dispose or direct the disposition with respect to any securities of the Issuer, and therefore their
obligation to file further amendments to this statement has terminated.
 
(c) Except as set forth in Item 4 above,
the Warburg Pincus Reporting Persons have not effected any transaction in the Common Stock of the Issuer in the past 60 days.
 
(d) Not applicable.
 
(e) On November 2, 2016, the Warburg Pincus
Reporting Persons ceased to be the beneficial owners of more than five percent of the Common Stock as a result of the consummation
of the transaction disclosed herein.
 


 
 

 
 
SIGNATURES 
 
After reasonable inquiry and to the best
of my knowledge and belief, I certify that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct.

Environmental, Social and Governance









Joseph P. Landy and Charles R. Kaye





The firm’s unique, globally integrated partnership ensures that all of our resources are committed to the success of each portfolio company. Regardless of an investment’s stage of development, industry focus or geography — the right people, with the right experience, are available to every entrepreneur and management team.
At Warburg Pincus, private equity investing is our only business. Established more than 50 years ago, Warburg Pincus has invested more than $60 billion in more than 780 companies in more than 40 countries around the world.
Warburg Pincus traces its roots to E.M. Warburg & Co., founded in 1939. The firm was acquired by Lionel I. Pincus & Co. in 1966, forming Warburg Pincus. John Vogelstein joined Lionel Pincus and together they helped to create the private equity industry. Today Warburg Pincus is a globally-integrated partnership led by co-chief executive officers Charles R. Kaye and Joseph P. Landy.
The firm’s strategy combines deep industry expertise and local market experience; the flexibility to support all stages of company development; a long-term investment horizon; and fully aligned interests among our portfolio company management, limited partners and general partners. Partnering with superior management teams, Warburg Pincus helps companies formulate strategy, conceptualize and implement suitable financing structures and recruit talented executives.
We take a long-term perspective and invest in businesses at all stages of development, from founding start-ups and fostering growth in developing companies to leading complex recapitalizations or large-scale buy-outs of more mature businesses. This approach also applies to our expectations of accountability, ethical business conduct and a sense of responsibility for the local communities in which we operate.
The firm’s social commitment is further evidenced by our charitable giving program, community outreach and volunteer services and the Warburg Pincus Foundation.
