        Dislike of squeezy bottke
I don't like the squeeze bottles for the extra light it takes a lot of shaking and then doesn't squirt that well. Love the product though but found it in a jar today so much better for ys.

        GREAT VARIETY OF PACKAGING
There is no better mayonaise on the planet!! I recently purchased a lobster roll at a takeout, I could not even eat it because the mayonaise was so inferior to hellman's and I love lobster.  Hellman's is the only mayonaise to use when making a lobster roll.

        Vegan mayonnaise!
Thank you so much for creating a mayonnaise with no animal by products. I have loved your products for years but when I decided to go vegan I was astounded at how few products have no animal by-products, almost everything does. Again, thank you!!

        To thin
I purchased two squeeze bottles from Costco to make a large potatoe salad. Both bottles I thought where bad. They have a thin consistency almost like a Cesar dressing, not thick like pudding. Hopefully they aren't bad, I am making this salad for a very sick friend and her family.

        Vegan Mayonnaise terrible; didn't get $3.99 refund
I bought hellmann's vegan mayonnaise and it was terrible.  Taste was not like mayo, and texture was too thick, not like mayo.  I offered to send jpeg of receipt of product that I paid $3.99 for, but did not hear back from hellmann's.  How about a coupon for a free regular hellmann's mayo, and we'll call it even.  I can still send jpeg of receipt to you if you like.

        Only mayonnaise for our family
I have tried several brands, and Hellmann's (Best Foods here in Oregon) is by far the best. It seems like it might be a bit sweeter than it used to be, but still the best.

commitment


ingredient story


our farmers


in the know































Hellmann's® knows that to really "Bring Out The Best," we need to do more than just taste great. That’s why we are committed to sourcing real ingredients for our delicious Blue Ribbon Quality Mayonnaise from trusted American farms.

We’re now using 100% cage-free eggs, and we are well on our way to sourcing 100% of our oils responsibly.

What is "Responsible Sourcing"? 









Cage-Free Eggs
GOAL REACHED: 100% cage-free eggs
Cage-free hens have better lives than those in cages. They are able to walk, spread their wings and lay their eggs in nests. We care, and that's why in 2010 we set the goal to use  100% Cage-Free Eggs by 2020. Through a deep commitment to sustainable sourcing, Hellmann’s was able to achieve the goal three years early in the U.S.
Hellmann's® is proud to use cage-free eggs certified by the American Humane Association™ and the Association For Controlled Alternative Animal Husbandry.

The sutters
The Sutter family hails from Pleasantville, Iowa, and has been farming their land for generations. In fact, three generations of Sutters are all currently working together— talk about a family legacy! They take great care to ensure their crops are grown in ways that preserve the land, while learning to stay current with the changing times and technologies.


















Favorite foods made with Hellmann's®: Potato Salad, Mexi Corn Dip and Deviled Eggs
Proud Moment: Helped organize the Pleasantville Future Farmers of America Alumni Association, which created a Livestock Teaching Farm for local Ag/FFA students.

















The Van Dykes

                                            Glen and Coleen Van Dyke of Poweshiek County, Iowa, keep family and conservation as top priorities on their farm, and in life. Their 3 grown children are all involved, and their farm even received the 2015 state award for conservation.
"The future of agriculture is solely dependent on taking care of the soil. Conservation practices are an absolute necessity..."









Humble hosts: The Van Dykes have welcomed 12 foreign exchange students, journalists from 8 different countries and the ambassador of Switzerland to their farm.
Favorite Food Made With Hellmann's®: Layered Lettuce Salad and Potato Salad

















The Whites

                                            The White family of Marshall County, Iowa, has been farming since 1876. (That’s nearly 140 years!) They are a true family business, and everyone has a hand in keeping it going — from their youngest to those in their 80s. They take care of each other, and take care of the planet by practicing sustainable farming. That way, they can continue to farm for another 140 years, and beyond.
                                        








Favorite Food Made With Hellmann's®: Mustard-Horseradish Potato Salad

                                    Blue Ribbon Quality 


In 1905, Richard Hellmann opened a deli in New York City and began selling his delicious homemade mayonnaise. He labeled it with a blue ribbon to represent the very best quality of his product, and it eventually became the iconic symbol of Hellmann's® Mayonnaise. Our commitment to “Blue Ribbon Quality” and real ingredients is why we’ve now committed to use only cage-free eggs and responsibly sourced soybean oil. Hellmann's® brings out the best, and our goal is to also do our best for our customers and our planet.




                                    Responsible Sourcing 


We are committed to responsibly sourcing our soybean oil. This means we’re doing everything we can to ensure that the farms we work with are dedicated to sustainable and responsible farming practices that preserve and protect the land.
Hellmann's® farmers monitor and work to improve their sustainability efforts in the following areas: land use, conservation, soil carbon, irrigation water use, water quality, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. By supporting these earth-friendly initiatives, Hellmann's® can continue to make great-tasting mayonnaise and preserve our lands for generations to come.

                                    Cage-Free 


In 2010, Hellmann’s set the goal to use 100% Cage-Free Eggs by 2020, becoming one of the first brands to do so at a time when only 2% of egg-laying hens in the U.S. were Cage-Free. Through a deep commitment to sustainable sourcing, and strong partnerships with suppliers and animal-welfare organizations, Hellmann’s was able to achieve the goal three years early in the U.S.
Cage-free eggs come from hens that live indoors, but are not confined to cages. They can move about and perform basic natural behaviors, like spread their wings, dust-bathe, roost, scratch and lay their eggs in nests. It’s a significantly better life. Learn more here.
The American Humane Certified™ program verifies that certified producers’ care and handling of farm animals is humane and meets the animal welfare standards of the American Humane Association. These standards are based upon values known as the "Five Freedoms": freedom from hunger or thirst, freedom from discomfort, freedom from pain, injury or disease, freedom to express normal behavior and freedom from fear or distress. Learn more here.
The Association for Controlled Alternative Animal Husbandry (KAT) is the inspection body in Germany and neighboring EU countries for the inspection of eggs from various forms of hen rearing including barn rearing. All eggs that Hellmann's® imports from Europe are KAT certified and adhere to Hellmann's® standards for cage-free eggs. Learn more here.




                                    Field To Market 


In 2012, Unilever joined Field to Market: The Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture. As one of Unilever’s top brands, Hellmann's® is actively working with Field to Market to engage 150 growers in measuring continuous improvement of outcomes-based metrics for 170,000 acres of soybeans. This organization brings together U.S. producers, agribusinesses, food companies and conservation organizations to create sustainable outcomes in U.S. commodity agriculture.

Making my favorite sandwich. I swear it's delicious. @Hellmanns pic.twitter.com/sK5XeHxVi9— Dale Earnhardt Jr. (@DaleJr) April 5, 2016Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowThis afternoon, professional car driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. shared a picture of what he claimed is his "favorite sandwich": A glowing-white bastard that consists of white bread, mayo, and bananas. This should not exist. We can only assume that Earnhardt Jr. grabbed three random items while walking blindfolded (or stoned!) through a 7-11. Or is he forcing these sandwiches down to appease a mayo sponsor? Or, worse still, does he actually like it? No matter what, we didn't believe it could be edible.

So we decided to investigate. Luckily, you can find these ingredients in almost every kitchen and corner store, which is the one, paltry redeeming quality to this meal. We documented the whole experience on Esquire's Snapchat (follow us at EsquireMag). See some of the footage below:In case the above is not enough evidence for or against trying the banana, mayo, and white bread sandwich, let me offer this description: It tastes exactly like you would imagine. There's white bread, there's banana, there's mayo. These things are all familiar to the adult palate. However, together, it tastes like an elementary-school kid vomited into your mouth after lunch.Here's another angle! That time @official_mattm ate a mayonnaise and banana sandwich...for science.  @esquireA post shared by renata s (@misswingman) on Apr 5, 2016 at 12:29pm PDTAnd don't just take my word for it. Social Media Editor Ben Boskovich was the only member of Esquire.com brave enough to try the damn thing, and he hated it.
