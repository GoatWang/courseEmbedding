Japan Equity
The products below are managed and researched locally from our offices in Tokyo.
Value
The Japan Equity Value is a Value-style product which aims to generate 70% of its alpha from stock selection and 30% from sector allocation. This is achieved via a team-based investment approach, founded on rigorous corporate research by experienced in-house analysts and portfolio managers, combined with quantitative analysis
Value + Alpha
The Japan Equity Value + Alpha is a value style product which aims to generate the majority of its alpha from stock selection with a team-based investment approach founded on rigorous corporate research by experienced in-house analysts and portfolio managers.
Japan Equity Fundamental Active 
This product combines both growth and value style investing to generate alpha. Its bottom-up process is founded on intensive fundamental research and utilises our proprietary valuation and earnings momentum growth models.
Market Neutral
This product pursues absolutes returns using DSBI’s ability to capture alpha by excluding fluctuations in returns due to market movement. It does this by investing in Japanese stocks while short selling the same amount of index futures as a hedge.
Japan Equity – Mid-Small Cap GARP
This product is an actively managed portfolio of mid and small cap stocks based entirely on fundamental bottom up research. There are no constraints around stock weights or sector allocation.
Japan Equity – Small Cap GARP
This small cap product focuses on GARP (Growth At Reasonable Price) stocks with mid to long-term growth potential. Through rigorous research, it aims to generate extra alpha by investing in micro cap stocks that are generally overlooked by the market.
Japan Equity –  Small Cap Absolute Value
Small Cap Absolute Value adopts a distinctive value investment style with a focus on price-to-earnings ratio (PER). Through rigorous research, it aims to identify deeply undervalued companies among the small cap market which are neglected by the market.
