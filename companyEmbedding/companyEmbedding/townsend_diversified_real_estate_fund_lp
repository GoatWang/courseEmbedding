In memory of our dear colleague and friend, Kevin Lynch.
Kevin co-founded The Townsend Group with our CEO, Terry Ahern, in 1983. During that time, he was a driving force in the growth of our great company, a friend to us all, and a constant source of encouragement and laughter for those of us who were fortunate to know him well.  Kevin’s energy, light-heartedness and optimism will be missed by all at our firm.

						The Townsend Real Estate Alpha Fund II Raises $496 Million						
					
March 1, 2016


The Townsend Group, a leading provider of global investment solutions for real estate and real assets, today announced that it has held a final close for its latest global private real estate fund. Townsend Real Estate Alpha Fund II (TREA II) raised $496 million in capital commitments from over 20 institutional investors including public and private sector pension funds, foundations, endowments and select private wealth partners.
Terry Ahern, CEO of The Townsend Group, said, “The volatility in the markets is providing us with compelling investment opportunities. We are finding investments with attractive returns, good equity multiples and the ability to structure strong downside protection. These opportunities come to us through our offices in Europe, Asia and the United States. We have already invested more than $300 million of the nearly $500 million TREA II fund. Based on the current level of quality deal flow, we expect to be raising our next fund later this year.”
The Townsend Real Estate Alpha fund series is a global private real estate strategy investing primarily in direct co-investments and secondary fund interests, providing investors with a portfolio of investments diversified by property sector and geography. Since 2007, the Townsend investment platform has deployed $3.8 billion in 86 co-investment and secondary transactions with 50 real estate investment managers/ operators throughout Europe, Asia and North & South America.
