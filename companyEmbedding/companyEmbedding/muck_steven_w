Muck hunting boots are sturdy and highly affordable footwear options for today's active outdoor enthusiasts.  Hunters, who are searching for rubber hunting boot clearance products, will appreciate the low and reasonable prices available. Muck Boots USA offers a variety of rubber hunting boots perfect for the next season of duck, pheasant, elk or deer hunting. Hunting can lead you through rough, wet, terrain and it is important to keep your feet comfortable and dry.
These boots come with an array of conveniences and benefits and the brand's boots are designed to keep wearers' feet protected in severe weather conditions, such as snow and temperatures that are under negative 50 degrees. Muck Boots are equipped with topline binding that prevents cold and snow from getting inside, keeping your feet warm and dry.
Muck hunting boots have durable, patterned outsoles that are helpful when walking and hiking across uneven rocky and icy terrain. These uniquely designed outsoles encourage both grip and steadiness, which are essential for hunting success and safety. Muck Boots for hunting boots also feature sock liners that have two important functions: the promotion of comfort and the reduction of heat accumulation. Muck Boots USA offers a wide selection of hunting boots that are designed to promote comfort for hours at a time. We have a 55 day return policy.

The Original Muck Boot
Muck Boots are some of the best outdoor work boots you can find for those tough jobs in the mud and rain. Simple rubber boots could work great for light tasks, but won’t hold up to years of abuse. Hiking boots can rough the terrain, but can’t fight off wet or cold conditions. Finding the perfect boots for your situation can be a huge challenge. They need to be strong but comfortable and able to be used all year long. This is where Muck Boots come in to rise to that challenge, fulfilling every requirement you may be looking for in outdoor work wear.
Why Choose Muck Boots?





Get Your Muck On with the Original Muck Boots!

Whether you’re just in the back yard or out in the fields, many outdoor jobs can get very messy. The harder you work, the messier you get, and finding quality outerwear can be a huge challenge, especially when it comes to footwear.
The Original Muck Boots we sell have been designed to handle whatever your life demands:

All-purpose, all weather: It can be hard to find a boot that can suit your needs all year round. With natural rubber and self-insulating CR-foam (neoprene), these boots are 100 percent waterproof and keep you comfortable in all temperatures, from subzero to a steamy 85 degrees. A breathable lining keeps your feet comfortable. These variables make Muck Boots perfect at any time of year, anywhere around the country. 
Comfortable and hardworking: For their performance, these boots are extremely lightweight, with durable outsoles double or triple layered and with thick tread for stability. 
Low maintenance: No matter what your day brings you, washing it off is a snap with the blast of a hose or a little soap and a scrub. The rubber can be conditioned with wax polish or detergent, and can be repaired with marine-grade sealant. 
	 

Muck Boot Features:


NEW xpresscool lining helps to spread moisture to speed the evaporation process.
Xpresscool fabric also pulls the moisture away from your skin to keep your feet warmer, even in the coldest weather conditions. 
Waterproof
Extremely comfortable 
Durable




Using Muck Boots
Muck Boots are made for every job you can throw at them: 

Slip on a pair to work in the garden
Wear them for all hunting seasons 
Trek in snow without the fear of chill
Put them to the test on the farm or in the fields
Stand and work on the job site all day with comfort and performance. 
Casual styles allow you to maintain the hard working performance of Muck Boots while looking stylish.

Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Muck hunting boots are sturdy and highly affordable footwear options for today's active outdoor enthusiasts.  Hunters, who are searching for rubber hunting boot clearance products, will appreciate the low and reasonable prices available. Muck Boots USA offers a variety of rubber hunting boots perfect for the next season of duck, pheasant, elk or deer hunting. Hunting can lead you through rough, wet, terrain and it is important to keep your feet comfortable and dry.
These boots come with an array of conveniences and benefits and the brand's boots are designed to keep wearers' feet protected in severe weather conditions, such as snow and temperatures that are under negative 50 degrees. Muck Boots are equipped with topline binding that prevents cold and snow from getting inside, keeping your feet warm and dry.
Muck hunting boots have durable, patterned outsoles that are helpful when walking and hiking across uneven rocky and icy terrain. These uniquely designed outsoles encourage both grip and steadiness, which are essential for hunting success and safety. Muck Boots for hunting boots also feature sock liners that have two important functions: the promotion of comfort and the reduction of heat accumulation. Muck Boots USA offers a wide selection of hunting boots that are designed to promote comfort for hours at a time. We have a 55 day return policy.

The Original Muck Boot
Muck Boots are some of the best outdoor work boots you can find for those tough jobs in the mud and rain. Simple rubber boots could work great for light tasks, but won’t hold up to years of abuse. Hiking boots can rough the terrain, but can’t fight off wet or cold conditions. Finding the perfect boots for your situation can be a huge challenge. They need to be strong but comfortable and able to be used all year long. This is where Muck Boots come in to rise to that challenge, fulfilling every requirement you may be looking for in outdoor work wear.
Why Choose Muck Boots?





Get Your Muck On with the Original Muck Boots!

Whether you’re just in the back yard or out in the fields, many outdoor jobs can get very messy. The harder you work, the messier you get, and finding quality outerwear can be a huge challenge, especially when it comes to footwear.
The Original Muck Boots we sell have been designed to handle whatever your life demands:

All-purpose, all weather: It can be hard to find a boot that can suit your needs all year round. With natural rubber and self-insulating CR-foam (neoprene), these boots are 100 percent waterproof and keep you comfortable in all temperatures, from subzero to a steamy 85 degrees. A breathable lining keeps your feet comfortable. These variables make Muck Boots perfect at any time of year, anywhere around the country. 
Comfortable and hardworking: For their performance, these boots are extremely lightweight, with durable outsoles double or triple layered and with thick tread for stability. 
Low maintenance: No matter what your day brings you, washing it off is a snap with the blast of a hose or a little soap and a scrub. The rubber can be conditioned with wax polish or detergent, and can be repaired with marine-grade sealant. 
	 

Muck Boot Features:


NEW xpresscool lining helps to spread moisture to speed the evaporation process.
Xpresscool fabric also pulls the moisture away from your skin to keep your feet warmer, even in the coldest weather conditions. 
Waterproof
Extremely comfortable 
Durable




Using Muck Boots
Muck Boots are made for every job you can throw at them: 

Slip on a pair to work in the garden
Wear them for all hunting seasons 
Trek in snow without the fear of chill
Put them to the test on the farm or in the fields
Stand and work on the job site all day with comfort and performance. 
Casual styles allow you to maintain the hard working performance of Muck Boots while looking stylish.

From steel-toe to camouflage or pink, we have Muck Boots on sale in a wide range of styles that will fit any man, woman, or even kid’s lifestyle.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
