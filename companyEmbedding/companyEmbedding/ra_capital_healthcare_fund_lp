TRANSLATION & HUNTING


Tab 1

WHO WE ARE
RA Capital Management® (“RA Capital”) is a crossover investment manager dedicated to evidence-based investing in public and private healthcare and life science companies that are developing drugs, medical devices, and diagnostics. The flexibility of its strategy allows RA Capital® to lead private, IPO, and follow-on financings for its portfolio companies, both facilitating the crossover process and allowing management teams to drive value creation with fewer capital concerns from inception through commercialization.
At RA Capital’s core is its TechAtlas research division, a scientifically trained team that maps out competitive landscapes in a continual effort to put data into context, identify breakthroughs, and originate conviction in new ideas. TechAtlas provides RA Capital’s investment team and portfolio companies (see Beyond Capital) with strategic intelligence, market research, and other resources. The team’s understanding of industry best practices is derived from an extensive collection of case studies documenting the impact of clinical trial design, partnership structures, public market dynamics, and many other factors on valuation and business viability.
RA Capital offers an Executive-in-Residence (EIR) program for experienced professionals seeking thought partners and a platform from which to survey diverse competitive landscapes in search of worthy projects, though we also have other models for collaborating with experienced “drug hunters” (see Translation and Hunting).


Tab 2

BEYOND CAPITAL
IN ADDITION TO CAPITAL, RA CAPITAL INVESTS CONSIDERABLE TIME AND RESOURCES INTO HELPING ITS PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PORTFOLIO COMPANIES SUCCEED.

We leverage our TechAtlas platform to identify potential indications as well as partners and acquirers that our portfolio companies may not have considered pursuing, as well as complementary drug candidates and technologies for in-licensing consideration.
Members of our Investment Team take board and/or observer seats when appropriate. We also host board meetings at our offices from time to time, providing access to maps to facilitate strategy discussions.
We help identify candidates for key executive positions at portfolio companies.
Portfolio companies are welcome to explore our maps with us; in certain cases, we may license one or more maps to them.


When appropriate, our team can create a custom map that comprehensively aggregates and organizes R&D opportunities as well as competitive and complementary technologies in those indications.
Portfolio companies have access to the TechAtlas team’s primary scientific and market research; we interview clinicians and KOLs, host Advisory Boards, and attend many academic conferences.
Our literature surveillance team flags discoveries that may be important to portfolio companies.
Our graphics design team helps portfolio companies communicate complex concepts with high quality graphics for their slides and websites, sometimes incorporating TechAtlas map elements.
Our communications team can offer assistance with grant writing and preparation of scientific publications.



Tab 3

TRANSLATION & HUNTING
WE ARE INTERESTED IN BOTH THE NOVEL AND THE RE-IMAGINED.

Discoveries and improvements in chemistry, molecular and cell biology, and material science create novel capabilities that open up new possibilities for tackling previously unsolved challenges.
The rules by which we understand biology are also constantly being defined and revised, revealing new applications for existing technologies and partially-developed drug candidates. Programs we consider worthwhile may form the basis for a new venture.
RA Capital’s TechAtlas platform is designed to systematize the translation of novel science and technology into optimal commercial applications, which both helps our portfolio companies with their pipeline prioritization as well as generates ideas for new venture formation.
In those areas that we have mapped, it typically takes us a few hours to go from a mechanism-inspired idea for treating a disease to knowing the companies that might have relevant clinical and preclinical assets to license, the companies from whom a candidate could be commissioned, trial designs and endpoints, competing and complementary agents, current and future standard of care, market size, comparable pricing, financing strategy, and potential acquirers, all meant to enable a thoughtful first-pass assessment of whether an idea could be worth a much deeper assessment.


The size and efficiency of our team allows us to parallelize the first-pass assessment of many ideas sourced from literature, technology transfer offices, pipelines of large pharma as well as small biotechnology companies, as well as discussions with academic researchers and clinicians.
We welcome experienced drug hunters searching for technologies/candidates and looking to start new companies to collaborate with our team and take advantage of the breadth and depth that the TechAtlas platform has to offer, as well as the capital we manage.
We believe that, when a business proposition is framed correctly, the capital markets have the resources and depth of understanding to fund proper experimental design and solution development, without forcing companies to cut corners, and we have collaborated extensively with other funds that share our philosophy to enable ambitious and capital intensive endeavors.




















"WE OWE A DEBT TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTORED US, AND WE IN TURN HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TURN OUR HARD WON LESSONS INTO A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR OUR INDUSTRY'S EMERGING INNOVATORS AND LEADERS."

RA Capital has a particular interest in funding innovation that contributes to the following healthcare themes, which converge on a higher quality and more cost-effective delivery of significant healthcare outcomes. These investment themes may change in the future.



PREVENTION & CURES



Diagnostics and interventions that are demonstrated to prevent and/or cure disease are of greater value than those that ameliorate symptoms and delay disease progression, especially if only incrementally. We are interested in ambitious objectives, hard outcomes measures, and proper controls.





COST-EFFECTIVE DIAGNOSTICS & INTERVENTIONS



Most of the new products coming to market in the next few years will have to compete in a world that increasingly values cost effectiveness. We are interested in seeing data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials that inform models of cost effectiveness, especially with endpoints that are recognized by private and public payors.





GENETIC TESTING & PERSONALIZED MEDICINE



We are looking for companies with low-cost technologies that have a competitive advantage in genetic testing and/or other diagnostics, including exclusive access to relevant, well-curated patient samples and healthcare outcomes. We have particular interest in a number of current niche areas, including carrier tests, prenatal tests, and the combination of pre-implantation diagnosis/IVF, because we believe these technologies will increase in importance and availability with the advent of low-cost sequencing.





PATIENT/PHYSICIAN CONVENIENCE



There will continue to be a need for technological improvements that meaningfully transform how healthcare is delivered, converting a treatment that would normally require a hospital admission into an out-patient procedure, allowing a patient to take an oral pill or self-administer a subcutaneous injection at home instead of having to see a physician to receive an IV infusion, or delivering a rapid diagnostic test at the point of care instead of requiring a second appointment to discuss the results. However, until we see more common sense in the way in which physicians and hospitals are compensated for their services and patients are billed for their utilization, companies will need to remain mindful of the myriad ways in which the healthcare system’s incentive schemes cause counterintuitive practices to remain entrenched (e.g., in the US, physicians in private practice have a financial incentive, a.k.a. “ASP+6%”, to prescribe expensive IV-administered drugs and therefore are disincentivized from switching to a cheaper drug or a more convenient subcutaneous form of the same drug for which there may not be the same incentive).





SMALL-MOLECULE REPLACEMENTS FOR BIOLOGICS



Although it is clear from the FDA guidance documents on biosimilars that there will be high barriers to allowing pharmacy substitution of biologics with lower cost biosimilars/biogenerics and therefore biologics are unlikely to ever be commoditized in the same way that small-molecules are when patents expire, it is hard to believe that the global healthcare system will be able to indefinitely tolerate biologic drug cost inflation. We are interested in small-molecule drugs that can deliver comparable efficacy/safety to biologics, ideally with greater convenience to patients (e.g., oral pills vs. injectables). We expect that, all else being equal, public and private payors will favor such “genericizable” small-molecule drugs over “ungenericizable” biologics.

GENERAL
PUBLICATIONS

The biotechnology industry is a vibrant community of researchers, business executives, and investors often charting new territory in the pursuit of innovation. After many years of investing in both public and private companies across the therapeutic, diagnostic, and device landscapes, our team has come to recognize some of the patterns of success and failure. We believe in openly contributing what we know; we have shared our perspective on valuation methods, business models, clinical trial design, and other best practices gleaned from hundreds of case studies in boardrooms, classrooms, conferences, and articles.
For example, we have helped entrepreneurs identify comparables for their businesses, guided management teams in prioritizing their development programs, helped companies gauge when they might be IPO-ready, and informed companies’ decision about how much capital to raise, when to raise it, which banks to work with, and which investors to talk to.
On occasion, we have also had the pleasure of speaking with students near and far (University of Helsinki currently holds the record/tops the charts/is the current leader for furthest distance). We typically discuss trends in innovation, how we invest, and risks in the healthcare and life science industries; we hope they remember us when they someday launch companies and are looking for capital.
We do our best to make time for outreach and welcome all queries –

RA Capital Healthcare Fund, LP Issues Letter to the Board of Cypress 
      Bioscience






September 13, 2010 11:25 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--RA Capital Healthcare Fund, LP today announced that it has sent the 
      Board of Directors of Cypress Bioscience, Inc. (“Cypress” or “the 
      Company”) (NASDAQ: CYPB) a letter urging that, to maximize stockholder 
      value, they engage in negotiations with Ramius, find another buyer, or 
      make a significant cash distribution. The text of the letter sent to the 
      Cypress Board of Directors follows.
    

LETTER:


      RA Capital Management, LLC20 Park Plaza, Suite 905Boston, MA 
      02116
    

      September 13, 2010
    

      TO: Mr. Roger L. HawleyDr. Amir KalaliDr. Jay D. KranzlerMr. 
      Jon W. McGarityDr. Perry B. MolinoffDr. Tina S. NovaMr. 
      Daniel H. Petree
    

      To the Board of Directors of Cypress:
    

      We are a large stockholder of Cypress Bioscience, Inc. (the “Company”), 
      having beneficial ownership over approximately 2,000,000 shares of the 
      Company’s outstanding common stock. We are writing in response to the 
      Company’s August 6, 2010 press release that publicly announced that the 
      Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) rejected the offer 
      previously made by Ramius LLC (“Ramius”) to purchase all of the issued 
      and outstanding capital stock of the Company at a price of $4.00 per 
      share. The Company’s press release stated that the Board rejected the 
      offer by Ramius because it was not in the best interests of all of the 
      Company’s stockholders and that the Company would continue to work with 
      Jefferies & Company, Inc. and Perella Weinberg Partners to evaluate 
      strategic alternatives.
    

      We consider the Company’s stated objective, to “evaluate strategic 
      alternatives”, to be too vague for our comfort given that the Company 
      has just rejected the opportunity to negotiate with a potential 
      acquirer. We would like to be explicit about what courses of action we 
      would like the Company to take to represent our best interests so that 
      the Company and the Board do not need to speculate on this matter. 
      Certainly we do not speak for all stockholders but we are confident, 
      given the recent trading history of Cypress stock, that many would agree 
      with our position.
    

      We are confident that it would be in the best interests of all 
      stockholders for the Company to enter into immediate negotiations with 
      Ramius and any other party for an acquisition of the Company at a price 
      of $4.00/share or higher. However, even if the best offer the Company 
      could come up with were as low as $3.00/share, taking this offer would 
      represent a better outcome for all shareholders, in our opinion, than 
      continuing to spend the Company’s remaining cash and royalty income on 
      the current ill-conceived pipeline and on in-licensing new compounds. If 
      the Company or the Board decides to contemplate the Company’s options 
      for longer than an additional two weeks, we would like to see the 
      Company stop all spending and distribute all current cash immediately to 
      the Company’s shareholders, keeping only enough to fund the auction of 
      the Savella royalty, whose proceeds we would also want the Company to 
      distribute as soon as possible.
    

      If the Company and the Board are convinced that there is value in the 
      Company’s pipeline, the Company can try to raise additional capital from 
      investors to fund the development of those programs but the Company most 
      certainly does not have our support in spending the Company’s existing 
      cash or royalty income on these new programs. We think the Company and 
      the Board will discover that there is just as little interest among 
      investors in the Bioline drug when the Company is pitching the story as 
      when Bioline was pitching it in the year preceding the Company’s deal 
      with them. The same is true for the other two assets the Company 
      recently in-licensed.
    

      We recognize that the Company and the Board may dismiss our letter in 
      the same manner that the Company and the Board have dismissed Ramius on 
      several occasions. Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to 
      create a public record urging the Company and the Board not to do so and 
      stating very clearly that this is not in the best interests of any of 
      the Company’s stockholders.
    

      The Record
    

      As of June 30, 2010, the Company had $2.73/share of cash, royalties 
      exceeding $0.32/share expected over the next 12 months, and a plan to 
      create additional value by spending the cash on new drug development.
    

      However, in the month following the announcement of the Bioline 
      licensing agreement (June 21, 2010), over 37 million shares representing 
      the majority of the Company’s float traded below $2.50/share, with 10 
      days of trading at or below $2.25, and the stock hit a low of $2.09. 
      There is absolutely no question that the overwhelming vote of the 
      shareholders during that period was that the Company had made a mistake. 
      They assigned a negative (less than zero) value to the Company’s 
      pipeline and its business plan, and concluded that the Company had 
      destroyed value by committing cash and future resources to the Bioline 
      drug. We know this is what shareholders concluded because of the 
      extensive, deliberate, and prolonged selling of shares by shareholders 
      at a price that reflected a below-cash value of the whole company.
    

      For an entire month, investors weighed the evidence and concluded that 
      the Company and its pipeline were worth less than zero. Had the stock 
      price recovered quickly, within a few days, one could have assumed that 
      the drop in price was due to a transient inefficiency caused by a few 
      investors not appreciating the merits of the licensing deal while 
      savvier investors stepped in to snap up shares and bid them back up to 
      pre-deal price. But to have such high volume selling at stock prices 
      below the cash per share for such a long time is nothing short of 
      damning.
    

      When on July 19, 2010 Ramius announced their desire to negotiate for an 
      acquisition of Cypress for a price of $4.00/share, the stock rapidly 
      rose to trade over $3.00/share, with 44 million shares trading at an 
      average price of $3.52/share from July 19th through August 
      25th. Again, there can be no question that the majority vote of the 
      shareholders during that period was that the prospect of being bought 
      out by Ramius or anyone at $4.00/share or higher was more compelling 
      than pursuing the Company’s current business plan.
    

      We consider the recent trading history of the stock to be clear evidence 
      that shareholders thought that the Company had a positive enterprise 
      value prior to the Bioline announcement, that it had a negative 
      enterprise value after the Bioline announcement (anticipating that 
      management would burn cash without creating value), and that the only 
      way they will generate a return on their investment is if the Company 
      were sold to Ramius or another acquirer.
    

      In case there was any doubt, one can even see how on August 26th, 
      immediately after the Company announced the in-licensing of two more 
      drugs, the stock sold off again over several days with high volume. 
      Given that Ramius has offered $4.00/share to buy the company, why would 
      shareholders sell the stock on this news for as much as a 22% discount 
      to this price (stock sold for a low of $3.13/share on August 31, 2010) 
      unless, as a result of the news, they were now more fearful than before 
      that management was intent on blocking the sale of the Company to Ramius 
      or another suitor.
    

      The fact is that the Company’s stock is now held to a large extent by 
      shareholders who believe that there is more value in selling the Company 
      to Ramius or a higher bidder in an expeditious manner than in letting 
      the Company continue to operate as it has been. Management and the Board 
      may think that many of these shareholders bought the stock recently and 
      somehow their interests are less important than the interests of 
      shareholders that the Company considers loyal to its long-term strategy. 
      The fact is that a huge number of these “loyal” shareholders voted with 
      their feet and couldn’t sell their stock fast enough well under the 
      $4.00/share Ramius is now offering for the Company. Had you not 
      disappointed those shareholders who believed your pipeline had value, 
      they may have remained shareholders, you would have had a mandate to 
      continue with your plans to operate the Company as you had been doing, 
      and your stock would have reflected your shareholders’ support of your 
      plan by trading with a positive enterprise value.
    

      But now, in light of the large trading volume in the stock since the 
      Ramius offer was announced and the fact that the stock price traded up 
      as a result of the Ramius offer, it is clear that many of your current 
      shareholders actually bought stock thinking that it would be a good 
      outcome if the Company were sold at a price of $4.00 per share or 
      higher. The greatest fear of your current stockholders is that 
      management and the Board might actually choose not to sell the Company 
      at a price of $4.00 per share or higher and that all of the Company’s 
      cash will be spent on its pipeline. The Company now has a new set of 
      shareholders who see value in a different strategy, and it is the 
      fiduciary duty of the Board and management to consider their best 
      interests. If management or the Board has any doubts that the Company’s 
      current shareholders want management and the Board to sell the company 
      for $4.00/share or more to Ramius or another acquirer, then you should 
      call a shareholder meeting and give everyone a chance to vote. But do 
      not claim that rejecting any negotiations with Ramius is somehow in 
      shareholders’ best interests; negotiations with Ramius are exactly what 
      shareholders want from management and the Board.
    

      Appeal to Individual Board Members
    

      We feel it is necessary to appeal to each of you individually to make 
      sure that you understand that shareholders hold you personally 
      responsible, as members of the Board and presumed fiduciaries, and that 
      each of you will be to blame if you continue to allow the Company to 
      neglect shareholders’ best interests by spurning direct negotiations 
      with interested potential acquirers such as Ramius.
    

      Mr. Roger Hawley, you are currently the CEO of a private company, 
      Zogenix, which has just filed an S-1 to go public. Zogenix, no doubt, 
      has investors to whom you answer and whose interests you represent. You 
      are also on the board of other companies that depend on the support of 
      investors. What message are you sending current investors and 
      prospective investors of all your other companies when, against the 
      publicly expressed wishes of major shareholders of the Company, you 
      continue to support a business plan for the Company that is preventing 
      the Company’s shareholders from realizing a return on their investment? 
      The Company has for years now been wasting its resources on one failed 
      in-licensed program after another, as was outlined clearly in Arcadia 
      Capital Advisors’s most recent letter (September 7, 2010) to the Board. 
      Management has a track record that suggests to us that they have been 
      running the company as their own personal non-profit CRO. We ask that 
      you put a stop to this ongoing violation of Cypress shareholders’ 
      interests. If you do not, should current and future shareholders of 
      Zogenix worry that the same thing is going to happen to them someday?
    

      Dr. Amil Kalali, given your current role as Vice President of Medical 
      and Scientific Services at Quintiles, a respected global CRO, we can 
      appreciate that you are an insightful board member when it comes to 
      matters of how to run clinical trials. We see from your bio that you sit 
      on many scientific advisory boards and on the boards of non-profit 
      organizations. But, from your bio, it would appear that serving on the 
      Cypress board is among the first of your experiences as a fiduciary of a 
      public company. We ask that you give very careful consideration to 
      whether you are currently representing shareholders’ best interests when 
      you support the Company’s plan to spend its cash and royalty stream on 
      clinical programs. You must have a great appreciation for the risks of 
      drug development. What we have tried to make clear in this letter is 
      that the Company’s shareholders do not want to see the Company risk its 
      current cash and the value of its royalty stream on these programs. In 
      light of this, why are you continuing to substitute your judgment for 
      that of the shareholders’ as to what is in their best interests?
    

      Mr. Jon McGarity, your biography mentioned that you run EthiX 
      Associates, which specializes in pharmaceutical business planning and 
      strategy. You clearly understand the risks of drug development, the 
      value of cash, and the importance of taking shareholders’ perspective 
      into account when risking their cash on drug development. You have the 
      expertise to appreciate that Cypress could very well lose all of its 
      cash and squander its royalty stream on these new programs that better 
      capitalized companies were willing to pass on (Note: It is clear that 
      Bioline, Alexza, and Marina had all shopped them around; all three are 
      public companies eager to maximize value). CNS drugs, in particular, are 
      extremely difficult to bring to market because of the high safety 
      hurdles, difficultly in finding good animal models, and especially the 
      subjective endpoints susceptible to placebo-effect. It’s up to the 
      management team to match the right investors with their plan. However, 
      management does not have the support of the Company’s shareholders, who 
      would prefer to see management preserve cash and sell the Company. Maybe 
      the key question is, if you bundled Cypress’ three new drugs into a 
      brand new company, would you be able to raise capital from new investors 
      to fund further development? If you think so, then we urge you to 
      spearhead this effort. However, the current shareholders are clearly 
      distressed at the prospect of the Company pursuing this agenda using 
      shareholders’ current cash and royalty stream. While shareholders are 
      unable to call a Special Meeting in which to voice their best interests, 
      we are confident that, with your years of experience, you must have a 
      good sense of what shareholders would say if you were to ask them. We 
      therefore ask you to do the right thing and stop the Company from 
      risking current shareholders’ capital on these new programs and grant 
      shareholders the opportunity to realize a return on their investment by 
      selling the Company to Ramius or a higher bidder.
    

      Dr. Perry Molinoff, your bio highlights your considerable experience in 
      neuroscience and CNS drug development. We know you appreciate the risks 
      involved in this field, especially since you also presided over the 
      challenging development of Palatin’s melanocortin agonist and the 
      associated loss of shareholders’ capital. We ask that you explain to 
      your fellow board members the tremendous risks involved in each of the 
      three programs that the company wants to pursue, including 
      schizophrenia, smoking cessation, and autism. The last indication in 
      particular may as well be a science project given the lack of validated 
      endpoints and untested regulatory process. These indications do 
      represent areas of great unmet need, but if pharmaceutical companies 
      flush with cash did not see fit to spend a tiny fraction of their 
      billions of dollars developing these drugs, why are you prepared to 
      allow a small and clearly under-capitalized company like Cypress to 
      spend what little cash it has on such risky programs? Why are you and 
      the rest of the Board so willing to take the risk of supporting this 
      strategy in the face of clear shareholder opposition? We ask that you 
      participate in a frank and open discussion of the risks of pursuing CNS 
      drug development with your fellow board members and then vote to allow 
      shareholders to realize the upside of letting Ramius or a higher bidder 
      acquire the company and dispatch the pipeline as they see fit; if those 
      drugs have any value, someone else will bid on them.
    

      Dr. Tina Nova, you serve on a number of boards and have been involved 
      with many companies and therefore have the experience to know that 
      supporting the Company’s plan to spend shareholders’ capital in the hope 
      of hitting a home run despite the opposition of shareholders is a losing 
      proposition. Any company looking for additional board members will 
      consider the message it would be sending to its shareholders if it were 
      to appoint a Cypress Board member. If you want that message to be that 
      the Cypress Board knows the value of shareholders’ capital and how not 
      to waste it, then please consider that the proper course of action is to 
      put a stop to the Company’s wasteful strategy immediately and push 
      through the sale of the Company.
    

      Mr. Daniel Petree, your biography shows that you have experience in 
      investment banking and manage a boutique firm, which no doubt gives you 
      expertise in executing transactions not unlike the three Cypress 
      recently completed. We assume that you supported the Bioline deal but 
      didn’t realize at the time that shareholders would disapprove of it and 
      would vote against it by selling the shares to the point where the 
      Company’s enterprise value was negative. Now you know how unhappy 
      shareholders are about the deal, which you and Jay Kranzler spearheaded 
      as the only two members of both the Finance Committee and Strategic 
      Committee, an arrangement we think was unwise and which the rest of the 
      board should not have condoned. And now that you know, we believe that 
      it is incumbent on you to serve as a proper fiduciary to your 
      shareholders, even if that means voting in favor of making the best 
      effort to sell the Company quickly and therefore negotiating with 
      Ramius. If the assets you helped identify have clinical value, they will 
      find a new home.
    

      And finally, Dr. Jay Kranzler, it was our sincere hope that you would 
      have done the right thing by entering into discussions with Ramius after 
      their first letter and quickly sought other buyers. But the fact that 
      you both rejected Ramius’ request to enter into discussions and then 
      in-licensed two more drugs demonstrated a shocking disregard of the 
      interests of Cypress shareholders. You teach a course on the business of 
      biotechnology at The Rady School of Management at UC San Diego and are 
      its sole Executive in Residence; you could still be remembered as a 
      recognized authority on the drug repurposing paradigm but if you 
      continue down this path we think that you will most likely be remembered 
      as a poignant business lesson to students and executives alike on what 
      not to do when at the helm of a company. We wish your board had steered 
      you better.
    

      From our conversations with you over the years, we felt that you 
      understood the importance of having a mandate from your shareholders to 
      risk capital on drug development in a calculated and prudent manner. 
      Instead, we have watched you steer Cypress towards excessively risky 
      programs, squandering the resources of the Company, and cause the 
      Company’ stock to trade for less than cash value. This Company is not 
      your personal non-profit research organization. Yes, it would be 
      wonderful to find a treatment for autism, help people stop smoking, and 
      give patients with schizophrenia respite from their debilitating 
      symptoms. Under the right circumstances, we might have offered to 
      provide funding to one or more of these programs provided the rest of 
      the business plan were well thought out. But the Company only gets to 
      pursue those goals if it first wins over the shareholders. Instead, you 
      and the Company have been dismissive of the shareholders, not bothering 
      to win their support for the Company’s agenda. The fact that the 
      Company’s stock dropped as much as it did and stayed down for as long as 
      it did after the Bioline announcement is proof that the Company does not 
      have shareholders’ support. The fact that shareholders sold the stock 
      when they saw the Company in-license two more drugs after rejecting 
      Ramius’ offer was proof that they would have preferred that the Company 
      negotiated with Ramius than pursue a scorched-earth policy, spending all 
      the cash so that acquirers lose interest.
    

      To reiterate, we hope management and the Board will do the right thing 
      and immediately negotiate with Ramius and others to sell the Company for 
      the best price you can secure. Until such a transaction is consummated, 
      we would like the Company to cut all spending on every pipeline program 
      and conserve cash.
    

      Sincerely,
