SECURITY


 
What is the minimum browser version supported by Gateway?
Gateway has been optimized to support Internet Explorer version 11.0; Firefox and Chrome (latest versions); Safari 8,9 and Microsoft Edge. If you use other browsers, you may still be able to enter the site but may experience reduced performance. Using unsupported browsers may cause unpredictable results.
 
 How does BMO Nesbitt Burns Gateway ensure the security of my information?
 In addition to your unique User ID and password, several features have been implemented to protect your personal and financial information. All information is encrypted using 128-bit encryption technology. This is the strongest, most secure form of encryption generally available for Internet browsers in North America. Encryption is a means of scrambling information between a client’s personal computer and BMO Nesbitt Burns’ computing systems. Information that is encrypted at one end is decrypted (decoded) upon receipt at the other end. In addition, personal information such as names and addresses are not displayed in Gateway.
 
 We also employ an Internet firewall to prevent unauthorized access to BMO Nesbitt Burns’ computer systems by external sources. This is an industrial-strength combination of hardware and software designed to securely separate the Internet from our internal computer systems and databases. Visit BMO Bank of Montreal’s online security tips to learn more about online protection.
 
 How do I know if my web browser supports 128-bit encryption?
 If you are trying to sign into Gateway and you receive an “Insufficient Encryption” message, you will need to obtain a 128-bit encryption browser. You can download an upgraded browser online.
 
 What can I do to protect my account information in Gateway?
 Ensure that your account number and password are kept in a safe place. Your password serves as a security measure against unauthorized access to your data. Protect the privacy of your account information by not revealing your password to anyone. You can also clear your browser cache regularly (refer to the question "How can I clear my browser’s cache?") or restart your browser after you sign out of Gateway. This should eliminate copies of web pages on your hard drive.
 
 How can I clear my browser’s cache?
 Microsoft Internet Explorer users:
                
From your browser menu select Tools.
From the drop-down menu select Internet Options.
From the Internet Options window select the General tab, look for the Temporary Internet Files section near the middle of the window, and click on the Delete Files button. A new window appears with the question: “Delete all files in Temporary Internet Files Folder?” Click OK.
Select the OK button at the bottom of the Internet Options window.

 
As an added security measure in any version of Microsoft Internet Explorer, you can set your browser defaults as follows:

From your browser menu select View.
From the View drop-down menu select Internet Options.
From the Internet Options window select Advanced.
From the Advanced scroll-down window, look for the Security section title. From this section, you can select the following option: Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder when browser is closed. 
Then click OK at the bottom of window.

 
 If using another browser, please refer to your browser's documentation on memory/disk caching.
 
 Visit BMO Bank of Montreal’s online security tips and get more information on online protection.
 
 Is email communication secure?
 Do not send personal information to BMO Nesbitt Burns (for example, account numbers or trading instructions) by Internet email. The security, integrity and privacy of information exchanged between you and BMO Nesbitt Burns by email cannot be guaranteed.








 
PAYMENTS TO BMO NESBITT BURNS 


 
 Can I move money from my BMO Bank of Montreal account into my BMO Nesbitt Burns account online?
 Yes. By using the bill payment process of BMO Bank of Montreal’s Online Banking, Telephone Banking or ATM service, you can:
 

 Deposit funds in your BMO Nesbitt Burns cash or margin account
 Make a contribution to your BMO Nesbitt Burns RRSP or RESP account
 Make a spousal contribution to your BMO Nesbitt Burns Spousal RRSP account
 Pay BMO Nesbitt Burns administration fees

 
 To make a deposit, contribution, or payment, you will need to add your 10-digit BMO Nesbitt Burns account as a biller on BMO Bank of Montreal’s bill payment section of Online or Telephone banking. You can locate this number on the front of your BMO Nesbitt Burns account statement or contact your Investment Advisor. Payments may take two to five business days to process, depending on your financial institution. 
 
I bank at a financial institution other than BMO Bank of Montreal. Can I use the Online Banking, Telephone Banking or ATM service of my financial institution to make a deposit, contribution, or payment into my BMO Nesbitt Burns account?
 Yes. This service is available to BMO Bank of Montreal clients and clients of other participating financial institutions. Please contact your financial institution to find out if it offers this service. 
 
 How can I make an RESP contribution using the Online Banking, Telephone Banking or ATM service of my financial institution?
 To make a contribution to your RESP account, you will need to add your 10-digit BMO Nesbitt Burns RESP account number as a BMO Nesbitt Burns – Deposits and Regular Contributions biller in the bill payment section of your financial institution’s Online or Telephone Banking service. In addition, you will need to contact your Investment Advisor with the beneficiary name(s) and social insurance number(s) for each RESP contribution. However, if the RESP contribution is set up as a regularly scheduled payment (for example, monthly) you will only be required to advise your Investment Advisor of the beneficiary name(s) and social insurance number(s) for the first scheduled payment.
 
There are three BMO Nesbitt Burns billers available on my financial institution’s online or telephone banking service. Which one should I select?
 Select the BMO Nesbitt Burns – Deposits and Regular Contributions biller to make a deposit or payment to your BMO Nesbitt Burns cash or margin account or to contribute to your RRSP or RESP account. When making an RESP contribution, please remember to provide your Investment Advisor with the beneficiary name(s) and social insurance number(s).
 
 Select the BMO Nesbitt Burns – Spousal Contributions biller to make a spousal contribution to your spousal RRSP account.
 
 Select the BMO Nesbitt Burns – Administration Fees biller only to pay the administration fee for your RRSP, RESP, RRIF, LRIF, LIF or LIRA account. This biller should not be used to make a contribution to any of the above accounts. If you are paying multiple fees, please pay them individually. 
 
 How long does it take to process the deposit, contribution or payment I made into my BMO Nesbitt Burns account through my financial institution’s online or telephone banking service?
 Payments for BMO Bank of Montreal clients can take two to three business days to be processed to your BMO Nesbitt Burns account. Payments may take two to five business days to be processed to your BMO Nesbitt Burns account if you bank at another financial institution. Please keep this in mind when making an RRSP contribution close to the annual deadline, or when making a deposit to cover a trade settlement. 
 
Is there a limit to the amount I can deposit in my BMO Nesbitt Burns account through my financial institution’s Online Banking, Telephone Banking or ATM service?
 Your financial institution may have a maximum daily limit for electronic or telephone transactions. Please check with your institution to find out whether there is a limit applied to online or telephone banking, or to ATM bill payments. 
 
 Who can I contact if I have questions about a deposit, contribution, or payment I made to my BMO Nesbitt Burns account through my financial institution’s Online Banking, Telephone Banking or ATM service?
 For questions about a deposit, contribution, or payment made to your BMO Nesbitt Burns account, contact your Investment Advisor. Please have the date and reference number of your payment when making an inquiry. 
 
Who can I contact about setting up my BMO Nesbitt Burns account to accept a payment from my bank account?
 Please contact your financial institution’s support centre for information about how to set your BMO Nesbitt Burns account to accept a payment by using online banking, telephone banking or an ATM bill payment service.

FIXED INCOME
 
When you’re seeking regular income or want to add stability to your portfolio, we offer access to a wide range of fixed income investments.
 

When you’re seeking regular income or to want to add stability to your portfolio, we offer access to a wide range of fixed income investments.
 
 Whether you’re looking to invest for the short-term in money markets or are interested in longer-term bonds, our wide range of fixed income products and competitive pricing will meet your needs.
  
Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs)
Your original investment is guaranteed, and you’ll receive a specified rate of return for the term you choose – terms typically range from one to five years. In many cases, your money will be locked in until maturity, although some GICs offer cashable options and other investment features.
  
Money Market Investments
Offer competitive returns over short periods – usually in terms ranging from one month to one year.
  
Bonds and Debentures
Available in varying terms of maturity - generally in maturities up to thirty years -  bonds and debentures are issued at a specified fixed term or variable interest rate. This interest is paid to the bondholder, usually semi-annually, as income during the term of the bond or upon the bond’s maturity date, along with their principal investment.  Most bonds can be traded prior to their maturity date.
  
Strip Bonds
 Strip bonds are issued at a discount to their face value and investors are paid the full face value upon maturity.  Strip bonds can be traded before maturity, offering the potential for greater returns.
  
Fixed Income Structured Notes
Structured Notes are issued by Canadian banks, corporations and provinces. They contain embedded extension features which offer higher potential yields than traditional fixed income investments with similar credit ratings and maturity dates.
  
Fixed Income Mutual Funds and ETFs
For investors who do not want to own individual bond positions, Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offer the ability to implement a variety of fixed income strategies and are an efficient way to achieve portfolio diversification.

This program is suitable for investors who want maximum control of their investments with the flexibility to execute trades online or through their Investment Advisor. With Meridian you’ll receive the benefit of BMO Nesbitt Burns’ expertise, recommendations and guidance to make investment decisions based on advice, instead of the cost of implementation.

† Wealth management products and services may be offered by Bank of Montreal or by one or more of its affiliates.
* Some conditions apply.
**The $1.00 service fee that may have applied when you use Interac e-Transfer has been eliminated for customers with an Everyday Bank Plan. The monthly Plan fee may still apply. Other transaction fees may apply if you have a Bank Plan that does not include unlimited everyday banking transactions. A cancellation fee may still apply when you cancel the transaction.
1 Terms and conditions apply.
2 BMO Growth GICs are issued by Bank of Montreal Mortgage Corporation and guaranteed by Bank of Montreal. The principal amount of a BMO Growth GIC is guaranteed and is repayable upon maturity, but there is no guarantee of earning any return linked to the performance of the underlying securities. The rate of return for the term payable, if any, will be the return on the portfolio of investments which are the basis for calculating the return on the BMO Growth GIC (the “Reference Portfolio”) subject to the following: the rate of return for the term will not be less than zero or more than the maximum rate of return for the four-year term, which for the BMO Growth GIC series 115 is 16%. The return on the Reference Portfolio, if any, is determined without reference to any dividends or distributions paid on the securities and is the simple average of the percentage changes in the value of each underlying security in the Reference Portfolio over the term of the BMO Growth GIC. The rate of return for the term: (i) is not compounded; (ii) as set out in this advertisement is based on the BMO Growth GIC series 115 and the maximum rate of return for the term is subject to change between series; and (iii) is not an annual rate but is the rate of return over the entire term of the BMO Growth GIC. If market disruptions or other special circumstances affect the calculation of the return, the calculation agent may adjust or delay the calculation or payment of interest, estimate the value of an underlying security, replace a security and/or determine the amount of interest, if any, that may be payable in an alternate manner. The terms and conditions for BMO Growth GICs are available at your local BMO Bank of Montreal branch.
¶ Annualized return for BMO SelectTrust® Balanced Portfolio Series A: since inception 7.65%; 1-year 4.6%; 3-year 7.61%. Series A as at October 12th, 2016. Commissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the fund facts or prospectus before investing. The indicated rates of return are the historical annual compounded total returns including changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions and do not take into account sales, redemptions, distribution or optional charges or income taxes payable by any unit holder that would have reduced returns. BMO Mutual Funds are offered by BMO Investments Inc., a financial services firm and separate entity from Bank of Montreal. Mutual funds are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
