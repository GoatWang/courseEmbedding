        reviewed on Jul 21, 2017    



We built the Dakar 29 which was completed in Dec 2016. This was a knockdown rebuild and our first experience building.
Over the space of a year we looked at many display homes, and by coincidence we ended up deciding on the first one we ever entered, which was the Dakar.
We chose Porter Davis because they had the only Façade which I liked after trauling the websites of the many other builders around, I also thought they had a reputable name, but more of a quality builder than Metricon and Simmons which we could also tell by the workmanship in

 the display homes on comparison.
Things moved along slowly with our original sales rep who we had sought out and tried to gain and assess information on such as how the basic process of building ran, what choice we had over the plan, could we change things, extend etc. She took time to answer our questions via email, sometimes going on holiday and sick leave where we wouldn’t get an answer for a few weeks and have no one else’s contact details to get in touch with.
She was a friendly person though and could relate her personal experience of building on to us. I felt she never knew the direct answers to our questions and always had to find out, then took ages in coming back to us, we always had to follow her up.
What we were trying to accomplish of course, was to find out what the cost would be, to then find out how much we need to borrow, and get an approved amount from the bank to know if this would be something we could afford to do or whether we were wasting our time. The whole process in full was a need one thing for the bank and one for the builder, and one before the other, it was very stressful. We never even knew the final price at the first contract signing- which was very nerve racking as if you don’t’ sign you can’t continue, it was a real leap of faith.
By this point in time our sales rep (who spent a few nights over at our place chatting) was gone and never heard from again as she had registered her ‘sale’. We were then passed on to [name removed] who was an absolute nightmare to deal with, wouldn’t answer calls or email, when she did answer an email she would address one out of 10 of our questions. She ‘finished up’ at porter davis towards the end of our build, but our time dealing with her was definitely the most stressful, we felt she had no manager or no one we could report to above her when she wasn’t responding to us or solving our queries or her mistakes, she made many mistakes, some could have been detrimental to our build, and if it wasn’t for me being on maternity leave, and finding time to double check everything she did, there would have been so many mistakes. At this point, we had demolished and signed everything and were going ahead with the build, we were really left wondering what was going to happen with no one to talk to or contact.
World of Style, yes we went a few times as they suggest you do so it's not so overwhelming, it still was though. There was an occasion where we were denied assistance because we hadn’t signed a contract yet, and the ‘assistant’ straight out told us that people come there, steal their ideas, and then build elsewhere! Again, making the time to travel into the city with kids in toe, is not an easy feat to be denied assistance for that reason when we had all intentions of building with them!
 PD were not flexible in any way shape or form to fit in with your life or situations. So as it turned out our appointment to set in stone our fixtures and fittings, was a week after my due date so we expected to have to make all of those important decision with a week old baby with us. However I was late, so we had no choice but to attend the appointment and hope for the best.
As there was no changing this appointment, my waters broke choosing kitchen benchtops, and we had to leave halfway through our much-anticipated appointment to give birth, we live on the other side of the city, so it was again a very stressful labour in the car to the hospital!

They allowed us to come back and finish the appointment, we then had another contract signing date a week or so after giving birth which is a whole day in a glass office with a newborn, signing your life away, not a good experience.
The lack of flexibility to move appointments around for World of Style was extremely poor and they should be embarrassed by that.
I should make mention of what is not a standard inclusion, we kept it to a bare minimum of upgrades, and it still reached almost 100k for us in extras, so be aware the price you see on the website will never be the amount you pay.
Things started to look up when the actual building started and we were allocated [name removed] as our site supervisor. There were a few structural mistakes that flowed through from the extremely bad admin manager [name removed] but we checked in almost daily, picked mistakes up early, let [name removed] know who would fix the few major things early. [name removed] ran the groups of tradies like clockwork, and our house was built in 5 months! We had a bad taste in our mouth from the experience so far and I can say [name removed] turned that around by the end of the build, and we began to feel we had someone to trust. (Finally!)
We never made appointments with [name removed] but it was easy enough to drop in regularly and see the progress, which was reassuring for us to check each stage.
Our admin manager to replace [name removed] was [name removed], [name removed] was fine but by that point everything was completely between us and [name removed], and the job of admin role was completed. [name removed] sent us the last few invoices and that part of the process with her was fine, I wished we had of had her the whole way though, we were just unlucky I guess with [name removed].
[name removed] worked hard to get us in our new home as quickly as possible and achieved handing over the keys at the beginning of Dec, getting us in before Xmas.
We have had the 3 month inspection. We only had minor issues which are normal with getting a house up so quickly. Everything was assessed and has been addressed really quickly. You can just work in with the tradies for those things.
The quality and standard of tradies PD use are high, I couldn’t have been happier with everyone I met and their attitude to the work.
We love our new home (well 6 months old now!)
Having had the experience, I would build with PD again as I would know what to expect and how to better prepare with the issues we had (Better the devil you know scenario?). I would still be cautious and try to get a satisfaction guarantee on who we would be working with in the admin office though! Don’t expect or rely on World of Style to offer suggestions of expertise in areas you have no experience in either, maybe ask someone you know in the trade or go to a home show or something for ideas on what works. It’s hard, but try not to let them rush you through!
One last thing, they had everything in my husbands name, this meant I was never included in the emails, and my husband had to forward everything to me, they even had the contract only in his name but we got that changed, they never changed anything else which annoying left me out of the loop, and even today I can't post this review because my details don't match the Proof of purchase document! Ahhh the admin!

I love our amazing home. The workmanship and build quality of our property is beautiful. There were certainly challenges and delays along the way however together with our team at Porter Davis I think we overcame them well. I am extremely grateful to all of our team at Porter Davis who helped contribute to what is now our beautiful and amazing home. It was a massive project from start to finish taking around 18 months from when we bought an old property, knocked it down and rebuilt. [name removed] our sales consultant, was great, helpful and ho

nest, our building co-ordinator [name removed] is divine, we had lots to work through over the course of the build and she always did her best to help us and went above and beyond my expectations. She is fantastic. I think she was new to start and she got better and better. There was a situation where we lost our first site supervisor unexpectedly, so we were given hardworking [name removed] who took over for us and did a fantastic job to catch it up and keep working with us to get it back on track and get it right. Of course there were problems and delays along the way but I think that is expected in building and [name removed] was awesome at bringing it all together in the end.  We were very re-assured with [name removed] - the overall are manager being available to speak with us at certain times. Its important that all listened to us honestly and authentically. The customer service and support all the way through from World of Style was pretty good. Handover was delayed a few times to get the house perfect for us but it was worth it because once we got the keys everything is working well and there have only been minor things to fix so far that Nick has been great to help with. If we build again with Porter Davis I'd be delighted to work with the same team!

Amazing and sincere consultant!! Nothing was a problem and even when we changed our choice of house after WOS it was not a problem and went beyond the duty of her job to make it all smooth for us. Then we were handed over to a BC No1, was very friendly and good, but had to change with in a month or so to BC2. and within a few weeks, just as we were getting used to her, we were told she was no more our BC, so came BC3.  She started and finished with us really friendly, but we had some issues in between where she made a mistake and was going to c

harge us for that mistake.  If we did not have all our emails available, there would have been some extra charges applied to us in a form of variation.  
THE FINAL HOUSE...Very very happy, but it took a lot to get there.  What i highly recommend is that know your rights and fight for them.  Our situation was that we selected a lot of extra perks that were offered and they were happy to take the money for it, but did not do all the necessary adjustments so that the house is finished as it should be.  Ex., we paid extra for the highest ceiling and even more again to raise the front entrance by 30cm, which was offered (as option).  Well that was all fine and good but they did not change the height of the Facade to accommodate this rise and the house looked half shut with panels coming down to their base height from the ground.  Even the outside lights were fixed at their standard height from the ground, rather than being raised to accommodate the height of the house (something to watch out for!!).  We had to fight and threaten to go to consumer affairs before they agreed to fixed the facade.  Also watch out for the level of your concrete to make sure they level it well, especially if you are doing the floors yourself.  We also had one major issue which we will not mention as we think it is a human error and we believe would not happen often   but was very significant and if PD would contact us will discuss with them personally.  

We had two on site Managers and were both good, except for the problems mentioned earlier and other minor issues. We found that the different departments were disconnected at at times did not know who was supposed to do what. A lot of the questions that we were told would be answered by WOS were not answered and were told then that it will be answered at contract and so on, which did not make sense because you want to know everything before signing a contract!! 
We must say everything was finally addressed even though extremely stressful and frustrating at the time, we are happy with our house.  We also feel if we did not know enough and fight we would have ended up with an inferior house.  
We would build with PD again as we don't think they are any worse than others.  Have built before!

Still waiting for our house

        reviewed on Jul 20, 2017    



Our biggest mistake was to employ Porter Davis to build our "dream home."  In October 2015 we were assured by the sales consultant that PD could build a house on our property and it would be completed around Christmas time 2016. After obtaining the fire and BAL rating reports we paid the deposit in January 2016. Over the next few months we had appointments at the WOS and in June 2016 we were to sign the tender document. It was then that we found out that PD would not obtain the planning permit, despite being told previously that they would do t

his for us. On the 4th August 2016 we signed the contract with "to be confirmed items" still to be quoted for. This was a big mistake on our part as these TBC items added an estimated 25% increase in the price of the house!  As we were required to obtain the planning permit PD would not issue the house plans to us to submit to local council until the contract had been signed. We would still be waiting for them if we hadn`t signed the contract. The planning permit was issued in November 2016 and we are still waiting for the building permit to be applied for, eight months later.  Three building coordinators and two more senior personal later we are still waiting for our nightmare to be resolved. It is now nearly 12 months since we signed the contract and PD is still throwing delay after delay at us with the most pathetic excuses.. We have spent considerable time and money clearing the site, creating a driveway for access, installing an underground electrical pit and water tank, obtaining the fire report and BAL rating and the council planning permit and still the first sod of earth is yet to be turned. In April 2017, fifteen months after paying the initial deposit, we met with a PD representative to discuss three options for moving forward with this project. After stringing us along for so long he told us that PD did not want to build on our site as it was not in their normal building criteria. Our site is a gently sloping, easily accessible, 2.5 acre block which any competent builder would find very simple to build on.  Needless to say all this has caused us unnecessary distress, upset, frustration and a terrible toll on our health. We are in our late sixties, early seventies and instead of enjoying our dream house, it has become an ongoing, unrelenting nightmare with no house in sight. Thanks a lot Porter Davis, may no one ever build with you!!

Any excuse under the sun

My build from start to finish took a total of 9 months. We had a number of different supervisors as they were moved to "different areas". I had the house inspected by an outside inspector and there were pages and pages of issues which took countless hours or negotiating to be rectified. Still to this day 18 months after being in our home we are still trying to get things that were meant to be solved by 12 months inspection fixed. And still to this day we are being given every excuse under the sun. They take a number of weeks to reply via email and definitely don't answer the phone. 
BE AWARE!!
I was also offered a chance to win an iPad if I were to write a good review..

I wanted to thank [name removed] for making our home (Lot 518 , Tom Roberts parade) construction such a great success.

The whole process was good. From the start we had a good feeling about Porter Davis, the way they presented themselves on their website, their display houses and the salesperson we talked to. They were a class above the other builders we talked to. Our salesperson [name removed]. was excellent in getting things done.

The contract process was tedious as you would expect with some mistakes here and there but overall it was well documented and our building coordinator [name removed] was easy to deal with and very responsive. All the errors were

 quickly fixed. 

World of style was very impressive and helpful and allowed us to make quick and easy decisions. 

The build process was stressful and the least enjoyable but manageable with the help of our building coordinator and sometimes the site supervisor. However the site supervisor was probably the least easy person to deal at PD, especially after our private inspectors found some minor issues with workmanship. the build was on time and within budget with no major surprises. It finished quick, perhaps too quick to our liking. We had private inspections throughout the build for extra peace of mind. My main complaints of the build were at handover when the site supervisor left PD and some post handover issues were not rectified until [name removed] our building coordinator took charge.

Overall good building process but still room for improvement.

Our experience with Porter Davis has been excellent from start to finish.  Our sales consultant was extremely helpful and followed up on all our queries promptly. We also found his price estimates were very close to final contract prices.  We made a few changes that we saw on a facade at the Wantira display home and these were quickly incorporated into our plans long before tender. He also made some helpful suggestions along the way.  Our World of Style experience was great and it helped that we had made most of our colour selections and interi

or choices prior to our appointment.  We did feel very rushed though on Day 1, but luckily we were able to review and change some of our choices at our second session.  Our building coordinator was helpful and always responded promptly to our queries, a pleasure to deal with.  We felt very comfortable with our site supervisor from start to finish. He kept us well informed during the build process and any problems were quickly rectified to our satisfaction. He was extremely knowledgeable and professional and did a great job.  We have just completed handover this week, so no issues with te build identified yet.

Really appreciate the assistance of my building coordinator [name removed] and site manager [name removed]. They're efficient, supportive, patient and friendly. Building a house is frustrating and stressful. They really helped us to go through it. The 3 stars review are for [name removed] and [name removed], not for Porter Davis. Without them, my experience with Porter Davis was horrible.

1. The construction process was well managed and the efficiency of the construction team really surprised me. The site started in last November and finishe

d in the start of this May (there was even Christmas holiday between it). The workmanship was fairly good except I found few problems after handover (sliding door cannot be locked, missing light bulbs and tiles missing in the balcony, etc). Some problems have been quickly solved after handover but some problems are still waiting to be fixed. Hope these problems could be fixed soon.
2. At pre-construction stage, I waited for more than one year for the building permit and during this process my building coordinator was changed four times. This was really frustrating since every building coordinator gave different information to me which made me confused. The 2nd building coordinator told me that the waive of overlooking issue of the terrace was approved by the council. However, the next building coordinator said the council would never approve to remove the screening on the terrace. I had to install screenings on both side of the terrace. So why i need a terrace with 1.7m height screening and cannot see anything outside? The nice adjustable shutters installed in terrace of display houses was not permitted by the council by the way, but no one told me that beforehand. And nobody told me why the building permit took so long and just kept me waiting....
3. At the stage of World of Style selection, the designer just didn't help in anything. He did not give any useful advice on the selection. What he did was just pushing us to make the decision as quick as possible....it was really terrible experience. After the handover, we actually found that we made some unwise choices and we regret not to appoint a third-party interior designer.
4. At the stage of sale, this was the most fascinating stage I believe. The sales representative promised everything but nothing came true at the end. The sales said we could increase the ceiling height for both ground and first floor. But after we signed the contract, the building coordinator told us that our house was too high due to the facade we choose and the council asked us to decrease the ceiling height for both floors. We intended to change to a lower facade then we can keep the ceiling height. But we were not allowed to, simply because we had already signed the contract. The sales promised we only needed to cover one side of the terrace due to the overlooking issue with a nice looking shutter or obscure glaze. Eventually, we covered both side of the terrace with 1.7m height ugly screening....

I am happy with my experience with building Porter Davis Plaza 49. My building coordinator [name removed] and site supervisor [name removed] are friendly and efficient. The sales and building process were very smooth. The only issue was that we had to wait for a few months to get the building permit at the pre-build stage. Once the building started, it went on really good. The construction was completed 6 weeks ahead of schedule without any hiccups. I would definitely recommend Porter Davis to my friends.

The workmanship of the property was poor with a lot of minor issues. Some things that were stated on the contract were not necessarily installed, lacking paint jobs here and there, bad attention to details and precision. Regret not having an independent building inspector prior to Project Completion and house handover. The process of the build was well managed but the customer service and support after hand over has been slow. Three months since handover we still have many unanswered problems, yet to be fixed or discussed and the new home maintenance department has been very slack in addressing the problems.

Love our new home. Would build again, just not soon! :-)

        reviewed on Jul 03, 2017    



We have just built for the first time through Porter Davis. We fell in love with one of their designs, and were confident to go with them as they have more good reviews than other big builders.
The workmanship and quality appears good, although we have only been in for 4 weeks. We did employ an independent inspector, which we were glad we did. They picked up lots of things in the build process that weren't to the code or specs and these were fixed by our site supervisor upon receiving the report. Yes Porter Davis do have an 'independent inspec

tor', but at the end of the day they are being paid by Porter Davis. We saw one of their reports for pre-slab pour- which was a single page stating it was compliant. Our inspector picked up a number of defects however.
Our build was managed well by the building consultant and site supervisors (we had 2 over the build). The World of Style process definitely means you need to visit in advance and know what you want for selections day. It was annoying that a number of our selections were incorrectly noted on the day, meaning we had to get them changed (and sometimes after multiple requests they still weren't changed). We also didn't have time for a wardrobe consult, but weren't advised this until we asked, and told we would have to make one in our own time another day. If we had known we could have done this in advance. 
One quirk with PD is that some things which are installed in a display home aren't allowed i.e. plumbing and niche on the same wall, downlights above the shower. If something is shown in a display home hold your ground and keep requesting it. We got the nice and plumbing on the same wall by taking a photo of a display with it. You won't get the downlight though as apparently they are taken out when the house is sold.
It is critical to go through your tender in detail. Ours was much, much higher than we were expecting and we found we were being double charged for items such as manual handling and roller doors. Every time you get plans re-check everything, as we found many items reverted back to original, despite a previous version having our correct choices. Make sure you have EVERYTHING in writing and document all your conversations. We were charged for things we were told were included, and I had all versions of our sales quote and plans with me along with records of conversation, so we were able to show we had clearly been sold.
The build was on-time - a couple of weeks early, which was a really nice surprise. There are still a few things to be fixed, and I feel that PD's final handover process could be improved. We had multiple dates for handover, and a big list of items to be fixed from our PCI. However at handover these weren't all complete (which is fair enough as some things take time i.e. weeks to order a new window to replace a scratched one), yet we are required to sign a doc stating they have been rectified before we are given the keys. 
Overall, while the process was sometimes quite stressful, building with Porter Davis was a good experience. we love our new house. We would choose to build again with Porter Davis, but I'm not planning on moving anytime soon.

Customer service been fantastic. The staff were very experienced and professional. They look after you and guide you through the whole building process. The home is beautiful few issues with colours that I selected was not the same but the home is of good quality. The staff could have listened more about your views and opinions about colours and such during colour selection but they were excellent.

1. The workmanship is generally very good except a few plumbing issues arose after handover and some oversight of carpentry and colour patching works. Their internal product/work review process made me confident not to hire an independent building inspector prior to Project Completion Inspection and house handover. 
2. Construction team and Porter Davis office managed the construction site well except a fire incident issue which could have harmed the building agreat deal had necessary action not been taken by the Building Supervisor, police and fire brigade.   
3. Customer service and support are generally good with occasional delay in addressing requests.

Everything was good especially the design and specifications stage except that we had 4 different  construction managers during Build stage  which was a pain and was a bit Frustrating during the build stage which may be normal with all builds but the Final construction manager who was appointed only few weeks before handover date managed to get everything done in the end........

Great build experience

        reviewed on Jun 22, 2017    


Excellent site supervisor ([name removed]) and building coordinator ([name removed]), made the whole experience as stress free as possible. Accommodating, communicative, friendly. Styling appointments during pre-build were quite useful and the representatives were very experienced and helpful, with the glaring exception of the electrical section ([name removed]). Build moved smoothly and swiftly, some typical hiccups with various sub-contractors but these were dealt with quite professionally by the site supervisor. End product was true to our hopes and expectations. Would happily build with PD again.

Poor Quality and Service

        reviewed on Jun 22, 2017    



What we thought was going to be a good experience has left us unhappy and annoyed with the whole experience. We thought our time at the World of Style was successful and pleasant but how wrong we were to be. After about 7 months we started the build process and we received call after call that we hadn't made certain selections. That was due to the staff at World of Style not recording our selection properly. So after confirming what we had selected we then had to sign variation after variation and charged extra fees as some of our selections we

re actually an upgrade. Thus leaving us out of pocket after the home loan valuation had been approved. Yet we made 1 change and we were charged $250 administration fee. Our building coordinator changed 3 times and by the 3rd time we had a really good person helping us. She was by far the best person working for Porter Davis. A number of mistakes were made by Porter Davis and they tried to charge us for their mistakes and changes, we refused to pay and they eventually agreed to cover the costs. During the building stage, our construction supervisor never contacted us during the first 2 stages and it was us chasing him up to inspect each stage. 
We did the defects walk through (about 2 hours) which was a complete waste of time as the majority of them weren't even completed. It was as though the tape had just been pulled off. Some of the blue tape was even left on. I have contacted the construction manager a week ago and have had no follow up to any complaints I lodged. I eventually had to call him again to find out what was happening. The quality of work is poor although they will tell you they have good trades. Tiles laid in bathrooms have scratches all over them and silicon left over them and the shower frame. Screws missing in the roof, half painted eaves, the list goes on. Don't expect them to do anything about it either. 
Not happy with quality and service!

Customer service from our building administrator Ashlee McMillan was fantastic, she was very helpful and supportive.We started off with Brock as our building supervisor but he then left the company and Greg Hobbs took over. Greg did the best he could with the trades he had. Greg was pleasant to talk to and he did calm me down at times i was feeling very frustrated! Unfortunately we had a lot of issues with the window and sliding boutique doors supplier. Wrong colour was delivered and installed, then when the right colour arrived and the doors w

ere stolen twice! Then the wrong colour again and then the wrong size!  I believe this contributed to our house being completed two months after the scheduled completion date which was very disappointing.

This is the second time we have built with Porter Davis, and I would do it again in a heartbeat! My original Building Coordinator [name removed] was sensational! All of my phone calls were answered or replied to within hours and she always made sure she could help in some way. Then we were fortunate enough to get the BEST building supervisor we have ever had the pleasure of working with. [name removed], constantly kept me updated, dealt with any concerns quickly and was just an amazing professional to work with.
So all in all, working with the Porter Davis, the World of Style, and everyone who made our home a reality...we are grateful!

        reviewed on Jun 20, 2017    



We sent pre plaster inspection report to PD on 03 of March 2017 asking to rectify defects and inform us to organise reinspections once defects are fixed. Since we did not hear back from PD for few weeks we had to send few emails asking about the progress. Finally we were asked to arrange reinspection on 01 of May 2017 which was after 58 days. Having reinspection with private building inspector, we were advised that number of defects were not fixed as of 08 of May.

ay from the slab.  We are not happy at all as all defects were not rectified even after taking 58 days just for pre plaster stage.

June 18th 2017 Update: Extremely disappointed

As per the contract we signed, manhole need to be installed in en-suite bathroom. When it came to install the heating system Building Coordinator sent an email advising that they cannot install manhole in en-suite bathroom because of heating unit therefore need to relocate it in bedroom. We strongly disagreed having manhole installed in bedroom as it ruins look of entire bedroom and we don't get good feeling when sleep under it.  10 days ago paid site visit with site supervisor and we were shocked to see old school manhole has been installed in bedroom. Up on requesting from Building Coordinator how they installed manhole in different location without contract variation signed and ignoring original structure plan we signed. Building coordinator sent an email with following comments and went silent. Since then no respond to our emails or calls. .

 Building coordinator wrote “Should you be unwilling to accept the $500 credit and agree to the location of the manhoe your home will need to be placed on hold until you are willing to proceed. There is not other alternative location for the manhole and we will be unable to proceed further until you have signed the attached variation agreeing to this change.

I have attached the variation stating the change in location and the $500 credit. Please sign and return this by close of business on Friday or we will need to put your home on hold.”


Is this ransom??  As Porter Davis says “we exist to respect the dream."   But what we feel they don't respect you neither nor contract both parties signed. How do we expect to respect for our dreamed new house with Porter Davis???

Contract No. LE119509
Building coordinator: [name removed]
Site Supervisor: [name removed]

We were very happy with the sales person [name removed], who visited us at our house a few times. She presented us with a very reasonable quote based on our requirements, spelled out where we were likely to spend extra money and was spot on with her site costs estimate.

From there we had an excellent building coordinator [name removed], who was with us for the whole build. If you have a good BC for the duration of the whole process, then you are v

ery lucky and we definitely were. Of course, there were misunderstandings, things forgotten by both sides and things left off the contract initially but everything was always resolved with politeness and efficiency. [name removed] was easily contactable most of the time but always had any issues resolved within a day or two. The service was amazing really, considering the amount of builds, at differing stages the BCs are working on at any one time.

We actually enjoyed the World of Style process and really appreciated the advice given to us regarding our selections. Kitchen Culture were excellent as was the service from Birk Blinds. We went there 3 or 4 times before the actual selection day including doing all our electrical selections which made the day a lot less stressful I’m sure as there is a lot to get done.  

We were also very happy with our tender presenter [name removed], she had great technical knowledge and any questions and issues that we had were easily answered or resolved on the day. 

Once the build started we met our Site Supervisor, [name removed]. Again, we were fortunate to be assigned a competent and caring operator for the duration of the build. I would be lying if I said everything went smoothly. Be aware that if a subcontractor damages your neighbour’s property than that is between the subcontractor and your neighbour. It is apparently not Porter Davis’ responsibility but having said that Dean did everything in his power to help with the eventual resolution of the issue. [name removed] was relatively easy to contact and was always amenable to an onsite meeting with myself or to arrange access for my independent inspector. As a tradie himself he was very knowledgeable about the end to end process and definitely added value to our build. 

Building started in April and finished in September, well within the estimated timeframe. Handover was relatively painless with only a few minor issues found. They weren’t all resolved immediately but the remaining, very minor issues were resolved after the 3 month inspection which also went very smoothly.

In short, according to our independent inspector (New Home Inspections), we have a solid, well-built home. Building a home is always going to be stressful but that stress can be alleviated by working with competent, caring people which we were lucky enough to encounter. I would give a 4.5 star review if I could because nothing is perfect and I still have a sour taste in my mouth because of a less than professional painting company engaged by PD. And even though our post handover issues were minor I would recommend not paying the final invoice until everything is rectified (unless you're desperate to move in) as the priority to rectify outstanding issues is lessened once PD have their money.

Initially I was happy with the sales part of the building process; however the contract preparation and documentation phase was not up to the level. I found lot of errors that took a long time to rectify. Since I couldn’t get in touch with the BC, as she was so busy with her workload, finally I had to bring up the issue to next level, and I had to communicate the documentation errors again and again with the new BC. 
I was been charged for certain Items extra, when it was supposed to be included in my package. These things were brought up in c

olour appointment and also during contract signing stage and so on. An extra $1000 (for 2months) been charged, since the developer was bit behind in titling the land, but technically PD should be charging only $500. I found it’s very hard to convince and get these things rectified through BC and with their workload ..finally I gave up. I find that the management should improve this part of the process, rectify them straightaway to keep customers satisfied and get through more referrals. 
My site supervisor [name removed] was a really good guy in terms of knowledge and proficiency, assisted me well throughout the building process any issues that came up in between were addressed accordingly in a professional manner. Five stars for him.

r now, seeing the completed house, make a lot of sense!!

World of style: 
A great concept however at times it appeared a little convoluted when trying to change things after we had left. An included meal would be nice when going through especially considering you when you build with other volume builders they include lunch!

The contract process - 
The second, and most critical part of the construction process!
We were lucky we were given an amazing consultant for this section of the build, I bombarded her with emails and changes and she did her best to get back to me and facilitate everything she could! My only problem I have with this area of the build is how PD have a single consultant for what at times seems like 50 people... This means that my consultant on a normal 38 hour week has on my $500,000+ house has 45 minutes per week to deal with any of my issues... An improvement would possibly be to have a maximum amount of clients that a consultant can manage because it is very frustrating when you attempt to call your BC and cannot get onto them because they are snowed under!!

The build-
My construction supervisor (SS) was amazing to deal with, I could not have asked for a better or more professional supervisor! He spent the time to go through any item I raised and gave his honest opinion and fixed everything promptly! He is the main reason I would recommend porter davis to other people. He is also the main reason for me giving 5 stars! The quality of the house him and his trades have completed is second to none and I am very thankful he was our SS!

A sincere thankyou to all involved in our build!!

As with most other things in life, the key to achieving your long-term financial objectives is planning. Your goal may be to fund your children’s college education, protect your family during your working years, or guarantee your own retirement security. These things won’t happen by accident. It’s important to determine what you’d like to achieve financially and then map out a strategy that will help you meet those goals. The good news is that it’s never too late to start.

Of course, planning your financial future can be intimidating. Luckily, you don't have to do it alone. As a New York Life Insurance Company agent, and a Registered Representative of NYLIFE Securities LLC, I am a trained professional who can help you identify your financial needs and then determine which insurance and financial products can best help you meet your objectives.

Please use my Web site as a resource, and do not hesitate to contact me for additional information or to schedule a meeting.Thank you for your interest.

Additional information



Description
David Dixon Porter was the second naval officer to attain the rank of admiral.  His adoptive brother was Admiral David Farragut.  Porter served in the Navy from 1829 to 1891.  He fought in the Mexican-American War and during the Civil War commanded fleets in the Atlantic and on the Mississippi River.  Porter worked in conjunction with Grant in the Vicksburg campaign using a mortar fleet and led forces in the Red River Campaign.  After the war the Navy rapidly downsized, and Porter was appointed superintendent of the Naval Academy.  He revised the curriculum to reflect the reality of naval life and enforced disciple while teaching the social graces to cadets.  The honor system was installed, bringing the Naval Academy on a level with West Point.
This David Dixon Porter mug is part of our Civil War Series profiling participants in the War Between the States.  Thousands of Confederate and Union soldiers fought in battles such as Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Cold Harbor and Petersburg.  We honor their sacrifices by telling their stories.
The content on the mugs is crafted for a stunning visual experience and to inspire an interest to learn more about history.  Robert Compton, who developed HistoryMugs, colorized the hundred-year-old photographs in order to bring the individuals back to life.  Biography and images are designed and printed in Bristol, Vermont, USA.
