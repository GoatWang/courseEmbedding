                Brian Cunningham

            Nola has been a pioneer in the biotech arena and venture captial for 30 years.  She was the founding president of Sequenom, a leading DNA analysis company.  She opened the San Francisco office of TVM, a global venture firm.  Nola has an instinct for the leading edge in technology and is one of the few investors I know who have followed and made early investments in nanotechnology.        



                Margarita Quihuis            






MR



            Nola pioneered venture capital and bioentrepreneurship for the leading European and American venture and institutional investors, long before biotech was an asset class or even hot. This track, institutional memory and experience distinguishes her as the Grand Dame of biotech VC.        



                Michael R. Schuppenhauer            






SD



            Nola sourced and managed some excellent deals for TVM. She played a key role in seeing them through to investment. She provided a strong anchor to TVM's US presence and demonstrated strong judgement, great interpersonal skills and a great sense of what was financeable. Many people inside and outside TVM are loyal to her.
