Is Pan American Silver Corp a Buy?
Does the company's successful cost-cutting program outweigh the threat of lower silver prices? 











                Charles Sherwood
            

                (Stockwhiz)



            
            Mar 31, 2014 at 11:45AM
            
            





Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) reported record silver production of 26 million ounces and record gold production of 149,800 ounces for 2013. Record silver production was attributable to production gains at existing mines, and record gold production was attributable to production and higher grades.
During 2013, Pan American Silver implemented a cost-cutting program that was quite successful. All-in sustaining costs net of by-product credits were $18.33, a decrease of 18% from 2012. Pan American Silver has a strong financial position with $422.7 million in cash and short-term investments and $689 million working capital at the end of 2013, while long-term debt was only $40 million. It also offers an industry-leading yield of 3.8% and has maintained it even during a difficult 2013, which saw many silver miners cut their dividends.
The consLike the rest of the sector, Pan American Silver's stock price was pummeled throughout most of 2013 due to lower silver prices. The sharp drop in silver led to lower revenue in 2013 as Pan American Silver generated $824.5 million of revenue, 11% lower than 2012. However, the revenue decrease would have been worse if not for being partially offset by the record silver and gold production. For 2013, Pan American Silver generated a net loss of $445.8 million; however, most of the loss is attributable to non-cash impairment charges totaling $420.4 million (net of tax impact) on the Dolores mine and a non-cash deferred tax charge of $86.8 million relating to Mexican tax reforms.
For the full-year 2013, Pan American generated $131.5 million in mine operating earnings, 58% lower than in 2012. The decline in annual and quarterly mine operating earnings was directly attributable to lower realized prices for silver and gold. Operating cash flows for the full-year 2013 were $119.6 million which was 38% lower than in 2012.
Impact of Mexican tax reformsPan American Silver was hit with a big tax bill to end 2013, due to tax rate changes. With the recent Mexican mining tax reforms, which include a 7.5% mining tax on sales and a 0.5% gross revenue charge on silver, gold and platinum, silver miners with substantial operations in Mexico such as First Majestic Silver Corp (NYSE:AG) and Couer Mining Inc. (NYSE:CDE) will be negatively affected. First Majestic has five operating silver mines in Mexico and is projecting production of 12.7 million to 13.35 million ounces of silver in 2014. Couer Mining operates the Palmarejo mine in Mexico which is expected to produce roughly 7 million ounces of silver this year. For Pan American Silver with more than 40% of its silver production coming from Mexico, these new taxes will continue to weigh on the bottom line.





Foolish TakeawayIn 2014, Pan American expects to produce 25.75 to 26.75 million ounces of silver, which will be about the same as 2013. This means that they are not likely to achieve revenue growth through production increases. In 2014, Pan American expects all-in sustaining costs in the range of $17.00 to $18.00, net of by-product credit, which gives them some breathing room at current silver prices, but not a lot. At current silver prices, it is hard to see much upside in Pan-American Silver shares. However, with an attractive dividend yield this still remains a viable silver play even at current silver prices.

Pan American Silver Corporation is a mining company in Canada. The company has mines and other projects in the United States, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia and Argentina.
In 2006 the company extracted 709 tonnes of Silver, 2.1 tonnes of Gold, 59,000 tonnes of Zinc, 27,000 tonnes of Lead and 5,700 tonnes of Copper.
History[edit]
[1] Pan American Silver is the continuing corporation of Pan American Energy Corporation, which was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) on March 7, 1979. The Company underwent two name changes: in September 1984 to Pan American Minerals Corp., and finally in April 1995 the Company was renamed Pan American Silver Corp.
Pan American Silver was founded in April 1994 by Ross Beaty and John Wright, after Equinox Resources, which had been founded and built with a successful gold mining company by Mr. Beaty, was taken over by a well-known U.S. mining company. Mr. Beaty realized that the fundamentals of the silver market warranted an increase in the long-term price of silver and that there were few well-valued and well-structured stocks available to investors interested in gaining exposure to silver.

Pan American Silver Corporation is a mining company in Canada. The company has mines and other projects in the United States, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia and Argentina.
In 2006 the company extracted 709 tonnes of Silver, 2.1 tonnes of Gold, 59,000 tonnes of Zinc, 27,000 tonnes of Lead and 5,700 tonnes of Copper.
History[edit]
[1] Pan American Silver is the continuing corporation of Pan American Energy Corporation, which was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) on March 7, 1979. The Company underwent two name changes: in September 1984 to Pan American Minerals Corp., and finally in April 1995 the Company was renamed Pan American Silver Corp.
Pan American Silver was founded in April 1994 by Ross Beaty and John Wright, after Equinox Resources, which had been founded and built with a successful gold mining company by Mr. Beaty, was taken over by a well-known U.S. mining company. Mr. Beaty realized that the fundamentals of the silver market warranted an increase in the long-term price of silver and that there were few well-valued and well-structured stocks available to investors interested in gaining exposure to silver.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
