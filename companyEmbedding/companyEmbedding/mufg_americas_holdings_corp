            Welcome to    
            MUFG in the Americas    
MUFG (Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group) is one of the world’s leading financial groups, with total assets of approximately $2.6 trillion (USD)1 as of December 31, 2016. Our services include corporate banking, commercial banking, consumer banking, wealth management, investment banking, securities, capital markets, personal and corporate trust, and transaction banking.
In 2014, MUFG integrated the U.S. operations of its subsidiary The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (BTMU) with those of San Francisco-based Union Bank, N.A. This combined entity — MUFG Union Bank, N.A. — allows us to better serve our individual, corporate, and institutional clients in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. We are headquartered in New York City.
In the Americas, we serve our corporate and investment banking clients under the MUFG brand. We go to market with our consumer, wealth, and commercial banking clients under the Union Bank® brand.
Our more than 14,000 employees across the Americas offer an extensive range of products and services to our clients doing business in our region and worldwide.
The Americas is one of our global parent company’s three regions along with Asia & Oceania, and Europe, Middle East & Africa.
 

Deep Historical Roots
MUFG has deep historical roots in Japan and the Americas. The origins of our business include a preferred financial manager for the Tokugawa shogunate, an entrepreneurial former samurai in the earliest days of the Meiji Restoration, the California Gold Rush, and coffee plantations in South America.
We are proud of our roots and employ the same entrepreneurial spirit to provide our clients with progressive corporate and trade-related credit facilities, money market, foreign exchange, remittances, treasury management, and deposit services.
MUFG is one of the world's leading financial groups, with a global network spanning over 50 countries and regions. It is one of the largest foreign banks operating in North America, the company’s primary overseas market, and has had a presence in Latin America for almost 100 years.
Founded in 1864, Union Bank is one of the oldest financial institutions in the American West and was instrumental to the growth of California. Its retail operations include more than 350 branches in California, Oregon, and Washington.
 

In the Community

The same commitment to provide the highest standards of service to our clients applies to the active role we take in the communities in which we work. As part of our corporate social responsibility program, we encourage our employees to volunteer and provide the same quality of service to their neighbors as they do to our clients.
Beyond our grant-making foundation and corporate donations, our ultimate goal is to create an entirely new model, one that takes the best of varied communications and work styles and produces a way of doing business that optimizes our success in the intense, competitive, and diverse global market.

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (1.26% upside)

CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA.
