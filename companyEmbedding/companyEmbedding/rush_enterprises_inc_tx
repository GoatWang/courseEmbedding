Certain Officers.

On
November 6, 2010, the Board of Directors of Rush Enterprises,
Inc. (the “Company”) adopted the Rush Enterprises, Inc.
Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan is
intended to be a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that
satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Plan is intended to be an
unfunded plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation benefits for selected employees and
directors, and constitutes a “top-hat” plan as
described in Sections 201, 301 and 401 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The Plan
administrator will be the Rush Enterprises Deferred Compensation
Plan Committee, appointed from time to time by the
Company.

Under the
Plan, participants may elect to defer a portion of their annual
compensation (including, as applicable, salary, cash bonuses,
Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) granted by the Company
under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
“LTIP”), dividend equivalents paid on any RSUs granted
under the LTIP, and director fees). The Plan also provides the
Company with the discretion to make matching contributions to
participants’ accounts. Amounts credited to a
participant’s account will be credited with earnings in
accordance with the deemed investment options selected by the
participant from time to time pursuant to which deemed earnings or
losses are credited or debited, as the case may be, to the
participant’s account. Participants are entitled to receive
or begin receiving the amounts in their accounts at a specified
future date or upon termination of employment, in accordance with
election procedures and other distribution rules contained in the
Plan. Payments are made in cash and may take the form of lump sum
distributions or installment payments. Each participant is an
unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to payment of the
participant’s accounts under the Plan. Any assets set aside
for payment of participants’ accounts are subject to the
claims of the Company’s creditors in the event of its
insolvency. Subject to certain limitations, the Company reserves
the right to amend or terminate the Plan.

The
foregoing summary of the Rush Enterprises, Inc. Deferred
Compensation Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to Exhibit 10.1 to this Current
Report on Form 8-K.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN AND DISCRETION

3.1. The
Committee, as Plan Administrator, shall have full power and
authority to interpret the Plan, to prescribe, amend and rescind
any rules, forms and procedures as it deems necessary or
appropriate for the proper administration of the Plan and to make
any other determinations and to take any other such actions as it
deems necessary or advisable in carrying out its duties under the
Plan. All action taken by the Plan Administrator arising out of, or
in connection with, the administration of the Plan or any rules
adopted thereunder, shall, in each case, lie within its sole
discretion, and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
Company, the Board, all Employers, all Employees and Directors, all
Participants, all Beneficiaries and all persons and entities having
an interest therein. The Committee, may, however, delegate to any
person or entity any of its powers or duties under the Plan. To the
extent of any such delegation, the delegate shall become the Plan
Administrator responsible for administration of the Plan, and
references to the Plan Administrator shall apply instead to the
delegate. Any action by the Committee assigning any of its
responsibilities to specific persons who are directors, officers,
or employees of the Company shall not constitute delegation of the
Committee’s responsibility but rather shall be treated as the
manner in which the Committee has determined internally to
discharge such responsibility.

3.2. The
Plan Administrator shall serve without compensation for its
services unless otherwise determined by the Board. All expenses of
administering the Plan shall be paid by the Company.

and the members thereof from any and all claims, losses, damages,
expenses (including counsel fees) and liability (including any
amounts paid in settlement of any claim or any other matter with
the consent of the Board) arising from any act or omission of such
member, except when the same is due to gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

3.4. Any
decisions, actions or interpretations to be made under the Plan by
the Company, the Board, any Employer or the Plan Administrator
shall be made in its respective sole discretion, not as a
fiduciary, and need not be uniformly applied to similarly situated
individuals and shall be final, binding and conclusive on all
persons interested in the Plan.

PARTICIPATION

4.1.
Election to Participate.

(a) 
Eligibility and Timing of Election to Participate . Any
Eligible Employee or Director may enroll in the Plan effective as
of the first day of a Plan Year, or in the case of the initial Plan
Year, as of the Effective Date, by filing a completed and fully
executed Enrollment Agreement with the Plan Administrator by a date
set by the Plan Administrator.

(i) 
Filing of Enrollment Agreement . Subject to clauses
(iii) and (iv) below, an executed Enrollment Agreement
must be filed in the case of Compensation consisting of Restricted
Stock Unit grants or dividend equivalents paid on Restricted Stock
Unit grants, not later than thirty (30) days after the
Restricted Stock Unit grant date and with respect to all other
Compensation, by December 31 of the Plan Year preceding the
Plan Year in which such Compensation is to be earned, or such other
time as may be established by the Plan Administrator; provided,
however , that with respect to any “performance-based
compensation” (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(4)
of the Code) based on services performed over a period of at least
12 months, an Eligible Employee may file an executed
Enrollment Agreement with respect to such compensation no later
than six (6) months before the end of such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all deferral elections under the
Plan must be made at a time that is permitted under applicable law,
including, without limitation, Code Section 409A.

 

 -5-

 

 

  

 

(ii) 
Revocation of Election . Except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.6(a) , deferral elections for a Plan Year are
irrevocable.

(iii) 
Continuation of Election . In the event a Participant who
has filed an executed Enrollment Agreement for a Plan Year does not
file a new Enrollment Agreement for the following Plan Year(s),
such Participant’s then current deferral election shall
continue in effect until the last day of the Plan Year in which the
Participant does make a new deferral election in accordance with
this Section 4.1 .

(iv) 
First Plan Year . In the first Plan Year an executed
Enrollment Agreement must be executed in the manner set forth in
Section 4.2 within thirty (30) days of the Effective
Date.

(b)
Amount of Deferral .

(i) Pursuant
to the Enrollment Agreement, the Eligible Employee shall
irrevocably elect the percentage or dollar amount by which (as a
result of payroll deduction) the Participant’s Compensation
will be deferred for the Plan Year. Each Participant’s
Enrollment Agreement shall designate separately the percentage of
Compensation to be taken from the Participant’s base salary
or commission for the Plan Year; the percentage to be taken from
the Participant’s Restricted Stock Unit grant, under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan, if any; the percentage or dollar amount
of short term incentive compensation, long term incentive
compensation and any other incentive compensation approved by the
Company for the Plan Year; and whether to defer any refund to the
Participant of 401(k) contributions made to the Retirement Savings
Plan.

(ii) Pursuant
to the Enrollment Agreement, the eligible Director shall
irrevocably elect the percentage or dollar amount of compensation
to be deferred for the Plan Year and the percentage to be taken
from the Director’s Restricted Stock Unit grant, under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan, if any.

(c) Subject
to the following sentence, the amount that may be deferred is any
whole percentage or dollar amount of the Participant’s
Compensation; provided, however , that deferrals will be
made after required payroll tax deductions and any deductions
elected by the Participant (including, but not limited to,
deductions for payment for medical and other benefit coverages).
The Plan Administrator may establish maximum and/or minimum amounts
and/or percentages that may be deferred under this
Section 4.1 and may change such standards from time to
time. Any such maximum or minimum shall be communicated by the Plan
Administrator to the Participants prior to the date by which
Participants must submit an Enrollment Agreement with respect to
the Plan Year or type of Compensation to which the maximum or
minimum applies.

 

 -6-

 

 

  

 

(d) 
Timing and Form of Payment of Distribution from Accounts .
At the time that a Participant makes a deferral election with
respect to a Plan Year, the Participant shall designate the time
and form in which such deferral, the Matching Contribution made
with respect to such deferral, and any Company Contribution made
for such Plan Year (and notional earnings thereon) shall be
distributed; provided, however , that all Enrollment
Agreements filed by an Eligible Employee or Director must provide
for distribution to be made at a time and in a form that is
consistent with the distribution options made available under the
Plan and permitted under applicable law, including, without
limitation, Code Section 409A. An election with respect to the
time and form of benefit distributions may not be changed, except
as expressly provided for herein. In the event the Participant
fails to make a valid election of the form of payment, the
distribution will be made in a lump sum if no election currently
exists; otherwise, the form of payment made by the Participant in
his or her most recently filed Enrollment Agreement shall continue
in effect.

(e) 
Subsequent Elections . Each Participant who has made an
election to defer Compensation may make a Subsequent Election to
further defer the time of payment and/or change the form of payment
for one or more of such Participant’s Class Year
Distribution Accounts. No such Subsequent Election shall be valid
unless it is made twelve (12) months prior to the previously
scheduled payment date applicable to such Distribution Account and,
for all Subsequent Elections other than those related to death or
disability distributions, the payment commencement date is deferred
for not less than five (5) years from the previously scheduled
payment date. In the event of the Participant’s separation
from Service with the Company prior to the expiration of twelve
(12) months from the date the Subsequent Election is made, the
Subsequent Election shall be of no effect.

(f) 
Vesting . All Compensation deferred by Participants under
this Section 4.1 , and any deemed earnings thereon, shall be
fully and immediately vested and nonforfeitable.

4.2.
Filing of Elections by New Eligible Employees and New
Directors .

(a) New
Eligible Employees: The Plan Administrator may, in its discretion,
permit an Employee who first becomes an Eligible Employee after the
beginning of a Plan Year to enroll in the Plan for that Plan Year
by filing a completed and fully executed Enrollment Agreement, in
accordance with Section 4.1 , as soon as practicable
following the date the Employee becomes an Eligible Employee but,
in any event, not later than thirty (30) days after such date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, any election by an Eligible
Employee to defer Compensation pursuant to this
Section 4.2 shall apply only to such amounts as are
earned by the Eligible Employee after the date on which such
Enrollment Agreement is filed. The maximum amount of Bonus that can
be deferred by an Eligible Employee described in this
Section 4.2.(a) is the product of the Eligible
Employee’s Bonus for the Bonus performance period that
commences in such Plan Year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in such performance period after the
Enrollment Agreement is filed and denominator of which is the total
number of days in such performance period.

 

 -7-

 

 

  

 

(b) New
Eligible Directors: A Director whose election as a member of the
Board first becomes effective in a Plan Year may enroll in the Plan
for that Plan Year by filing a completed and fully executed
Enrollment Agreement, in accordance with Section 4.1, as soon
as practicable following the effective date of such
Director’s election but, in any event, not later than thirty
(30) days after the effective date of such election.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, any election by a Director
to defer Compensation pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall apply
only to such Compensation earned by the Director after the date on
which such Enrollment Agreement is filed.

4.3.
Matching Contributions . If a Participant defers
Compensation for a Plan Year pursuant to Section 4.1 ,
the Company will credit a Matching Contribution to the
Participant’s Class Year

EXHIBIT 99.1Rush Enterprises, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2016 Results Revenues of $4.2 billion, $40.6 million net incomeHeavy-Duty new commercial vehicle sales challenged by decreased activity from large fleets and low used truck valuationsStrong performance in medium-duty new commercial vehicle sales continued throughout 2016Continued to make progress on aftermarket strategic initiatives SAN ANTONIO, Feb.  15, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rush Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ:RUSHA) (NASDAQ:RUSHB), which operates the largest network of commercial vehicle dealerships in North America, today announced that for the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company achieved revenues of $4.2 billion and net income of $40.6 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared with revenues of $5.0 billion and net income of $66.1 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2015. “New heavy-duty truck sales were off significantly in 2016, as several of our large fleet customers delayed purchases due to excess capacity, an erratic freight environment and low used truck trade-in valuations caused by an oversupply of used trucks,” said W.M. “Rusty” Rush, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Rush Enterprises, Inc.  “However, our solid performance in medium-duty new truck sales was a bright spot for the year,” Rush added. “In 2016, we made progress on aftermarket strategic initiatives including all-makes parts sales growth and vehicle technologies.  We also continued to expand our compressed natural gas fuel system product offerings.  While most of our efforts in these areas in the past year were about building the foundation, we remain committed to expanding these aftermarket solutions and expect to see a positive impact on our financial results from these initiatives in 2017.  In 2016, we also strengthened our nationwide network of Rush Truck Centers by opening new locations in California and Kentucky and increasing service capabilities in California, Colorado, Illinois, Ohio and Texas,” said Rush.   “Early in 2016, we instituted extensive expense reductions to offset declining revenue, including consolidating several locations in our Rush Truck Centers network.  These efforts allowed us to manage costs and remain nimble in a down market.  Additionally, we formed a Business Process Management group that has been tasked with improving efficiencies in the way we do business throughout the organization to enable us to increase productivity, decrease expenses and better ensure a consistent experience for both our customers and our employees,” Rush explained. “I am grateful to our leadership team for helping us manage our way through a difficult year and to all of our employees for their unwavering commitment to our customers.  As always, but especially in a challenging year, their efforts are sincerely appreciated,” said Rush. Operations Aftermarket Solutions Aftermarket services accounted for 67% of the Company’s total gross profits in 2016, with parts, service and body shop revenues reaching $1.3 billion, down 3.6% over 2015.  The Company achieved an annual absorption ratio of 112.2%.  “The decline in demand for aftermarket services from the energy sector that began in late 2015 continued through the first quarter of 2016, and activity remained at decreased levels through 2016.  We were able to recoup some of those lost revenues in other areas, including parts and service support for construction, refuse and other business sectors, and we continued to aggressively pursue aftermarket initiatives in an effort to help offset lost energy sector revenues,” Rush explained. “In 2016, we strengthened our all-makes parts focus by expanding the product lines we offer, introducing a comprehensive parts catalog and implementing a marketing campaign of frequent communication to customers.  We believe these efforts position us well to achieve our goal of being the market leader in all-makes parts.  We also expanded distribution of our Rig Tough Truck Parts proprietary line of parts and accessories to additional Rush Truck Centers locations, and we grew our parts sales organization to support our strategic focus,” Rush said. “In 2016, we launched our RushCare Service Connect customer portal and expanded our telematics offerings; both have been well received by our customers.  We also expanded our Momentum Fuel Technologies product offering, and now offer compressed natural gas fuel systems to meet the needs of the most popular compressed natural gas applications, including waste, transit and over-the-road customers,” said Rush. “As we look ahead, we are beginning to see a slight increase in parts and service activity from the energy sector, notably an increase in our mobile services supporting energy customers.  Aftermarket business in construction, refuse and other vocational areas is expected to remain stable.  We anticipate increased adoption of RushCare Service Connect and our telematics offerings, and we remain committed to our long-term initiatives; we expect to realize positive impact from these efforts in 2017,” said Rush. Truck Sales In 2016, Rush Class 8 retail sales accounted for 5.5% of the total U.S. Class 8 market, compared to 6.7% in 2015.  The Company sold 10,816 Class 8 trucks in 2016, a decrease of 35.9% compared to 2015. “2016 was a tough year for heavy-duty truck sales across the industry, as U.S. Class 8 retail sales were down 22.2% compared to 2015.  Throughout 2016, significantly reduced demand from several large fleet customers negatively impacted our new Class 8 truck sales.  We saw some moderate increases in vocational activity in 2016, particularly in Texas, California and Florida, but over-the-road truck sales were sluggish throughout 2016. “Additionally, an oversupply of used trucks throughout the industry continues to suppress used truck trade-in values, negatively impacting new truck sales.  We expect used truck valuations will remain soft for most of 2017, which will continue to negatively impact new Class 8 truck sales,” said Rush. ACT Research forecasts U.S. retail sales of Class 8 trucks to total 154,000 units in 2017, a 21.8% decrease compared to 2016 retail sales.  “We believe 2017 is going to be another tough year for Class 8 truck sales.  That said, many customers are cautiously optimistic about potential economic improvements, and as a result, we are seeing an increase in quoting activity.  Our sales force is focused, and we will compete aggressively for every truck sales opportunity that we have,” said Rush.  “We are confident that, at a minimum, our Class 8 truck sales will be on pace with the industry.” Rush’s U.S. Class 4-7 medium-duty truck sales reached 11,135 units in 2016, flat compared to 2015.   Rush’s medium-duty new truck sales accounted for 4.9% of the total U.S. Class 4-7 market in 2016. “Our nationwide inventory of ready-to-roll medium-duty trucks and wide range of products, including Peterbilt, International, Hino, Isuzu, Ford and Mitsubishi Fuso gives us the ability to support customers in a wide variety of business sectors.  This enabled another strong year for us in Class 4-7 truck sales in 2016,” said Rush. ACT Research forecasts U. S. retail sales of Class 4-7 vehicles to reach 232,800 units in 2017, a 2.9% increase over 2016.  “There was an uptick in quoting activity in the fourth quarter, particularly coming from the infrastructure sector and from ancillary businesses that support the infrastructure sector.  We expect this to be a key driver for medium-duty new truck sales in 2017, and we remain focused on providing work-ready inventory at our dealerships to meet the immediate needs of these customers.  We believe our Class 4-7 truck sales will remain consistent with the industry in 2017,” said Rush. Financial Highlights For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company’s gross revenues totaled $4.2 billion, compared to gross revenues of $5.0 billion reported in 2015.  The Company reported net income for the year of $40.6 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared with a net income of $66.1 million, or $1.61 per diluted share in 2015.  Aftermarket services revenues were $1.3 billion in the year ended 2016, compared to $1.4 billion in the year ended 2015.  The Company sold 30,635 new and used commercial vehicles in 2016, an 18.7% decrease compared to 37,702 new and used commercial vehicles in 2015.  The Company delivered 10,816 new heavy-duty trucks, 11,135 new medium-duty commercial vehicles, 1,676 new light-duty commercial vehicles and 7,008 used commercial vehicles during 2016, compared to 16,874 new heavy-duty trucks, 11,241 new medium-duty commercial vehicles, 1,665 new light-duty commercial vehicles and 7,922 used commercial vehicles during 2015.

GAAP measures.  Management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information about the results of operations of the Company for the current and past periods.  Management believes that investors should have the same information available to them that management uses to assess the Company’s operating performance and capital structure.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP financial measures.  Investors are cautioned that non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.       Three Months Ended  Vehicle Sales Revenue  (in thousands) December 31, 2016 December 31,

vehicle dealerships and considers Rush Truck Centers’ “absorption ratio” to be of critical importance.  Absorption ratio is calculated by dividing the gross profit from the parts, service and body shop departments by the overhead expenses of all of a dealership’s departments, except for the selling expenses of the new and used commercial vehicle departments and carrying costs of new and used commercial vehicle inventory.  When 100% absorption is achieved, then gross profit from the sale of a commercial vehicle, after sales commissions and inventory carrying costs, directly impacts operating profit.  Debt Analysis   (in thousands)  December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015Floor plan notes payable $  646,945  $  854,758 Current maturities of long-term debt  130,717   151,024 Current

uses “Adjusted Total Debt” to reflect the Company’s estimated financial obligations less debt related to lease and rental fleet (L&RFD) and floor plan notes payable (FPNP), and “Adjusted Net (Cash) Debt” to present the amount of Adjusted Total Debt net of cash and cash equivalents on the Company’s balance sheet.  The FPNP is used to finance the Company’s new and used inventory, with its principal balance changing daily as vehicles are purchased and sold and the sale proceeds are used to repay the notes.  Consequently, in managing the business, management views the FPNP as interest bearing accounts payable, representing the cost of acquiring the vehicle that is then repaid when the vehicle is sold, as the Company’s credit agreements require it to repay loans used to purchase vehicles when such vehicles are sold.  The Company’s lease & rental fleet are fully financed and are either (i) leased to customers under long-term lease arrangements or (ii), to a lesser extent, dedicated to the Company’s rental business.  In both cases, the lease and rental payments fully cover the capital costs of the lease & rental fleet (i.e., the principal repayments and interest expense on the borrowings used to acquire the vehicles and the depreciation expense associated with the vehicles), plus a profit margin for the Company. The Company believes excluding the FPNP and L&RFD from the Company’s total debt for this purpose provides management with supplemental information regarding the Company’s capital structure and leverage profile and assists investors in performing analysis that is consistent with financial models developed by Company management and research analysts.  “Adjusted Total Debt” and “Adjusted Net (Cash) Debt” are both non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s debt obligations, as reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Additionally, these non-GAAP measures may vary among companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.   Twelve Months EndedEBITDA  (in thousands)  December 31,

– Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) $  127,263  $  152,625  The Company presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as additional information about its operating results.  The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA that excludes the addition of interest expense associated with FPNP to EBITDA is consistent with management’s presentation of Adjusted Total Debt, in each case reflecting management’s view of interest expense associated with the FPNP as an operating expense of the Company, and to provide management with supplemental information regarding operating results and to assist investors in performing analysis that is consistent with financial models developed by management and research analysis.  Management recorded a charge to selling, general and administrative expense during the first and second quarters of 2016 related to the closing of certain dealerships and the disposition of excess real estate.  Management believes adding back this charge to EBITDA provides both the investors and management with supplemental information regarding the Company’s core operating results. “EBITDA” and “Adjusted EBITDA” are both non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income of the Company, as reported in the Company’s consolidated statements of income in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Additionally, these non-GAAP measures may vary among companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.    Twelve Months EndedFree Cash Flow  (in thousands)  December 31, 2016December 31, 2015Net

financial measures of the Company’s ability to generate cash from operating its business.  Free Cash Flow is calculated by subtracting the acquisition of property and equipment included in the Cash flows from investing activities from Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.  For purposes of deriving Adjusted Free Cash Flow from the Company’s operating cash flow, Company management makes the following adjustments: (i) adds back draws (or subtracts payments) on the floor plan financing that are included in Cash flows from financing activities, as their purpose is to finance the vehicle inventory that is included in Cash flows from operating activities; (ii) adds back proceeds from notes payable related specifically to the financing of the lease and rental fleet that are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities; (iii) subtracts draws on floor plan financing, net and proceeds from L&RFD related to business acquisition assets that are included in Cash flows from investing activities; (iv) subtracts principal payments on notes payable related specifically to the financing of the lease and rental fleet that are included in Cash flows from financing activities; and (v) adds back non-maintenance capital expenditures that are for growth and expansion (i.e. building of new dealership facilities) that are not considered necessary to maintain the current level of cash generated by the business.  “Free Cash Flow” and “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” provides management with supplemental information regarding the Company’s cash flows from operating activities and assists investors in performing analysis that is consistent with the financial models developed by Company management. “Free Cash Flow” and “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” are both non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net cash provided by (used in) operations of the Company, as reported in the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Additionally, these non-GAAP measures may vary among companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

excludes L&RFD, FPNP, and cash and cash equivalents, for the reasons provided in the debt analysis above and uses Adjusted Net Debt in the calculation.  The Company believes this approach provides management with supplemental information regarding the Company’s leverage profile and capital structure, and assists investors in performing analysis that is consistent with financial models developed by Company management and research analysts.  “Adjusted Net (Cash) Debt” and “Adjusted Invested Capital” are both non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, total shareholders’ equity, as reported in the Company’s consolidated statements of income in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Additionally, these non-GAAP measures may vary among companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.  Contact: Rush Enterprises, Inc., San Antonio Steven L.
