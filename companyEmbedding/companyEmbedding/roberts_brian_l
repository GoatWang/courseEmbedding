Early life and education[edit]
Roberts was born into a Jewish family[3][4] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Ralph J. Roberts, the founder of Comcast Corporation, and Suzanne Fleisher, a former actress and playwright.[5] Roberts graduated from the Germantown Academy and earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1981, and immediately began working for Comcast.[6]
Career[edit]
Roberts is Chairman and CEO of Comcast Corporation, and personally controls 33 1/3% of the voting rights of the company.[7] He was named President of Comcast Corporation in 1990 when the company had $657 million in annual revenue. Comcast Corporation’s annual revenue has since grown to $74.5 billion.[2]
Roberts is Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA), and a former treasurer.[8] Roberts served as Chairman of NCTA from 1995 to 1996, when the landmark deregulatory 1996 Telecommunications Act became law.
In 2014, Roberts received US$26.4 million in compensation,[9] and in 2015, his net worth was US$1.7 billion.[1]
Awards and philanthropy[edit]
Institutional Investor Magazine named Roberts as its top vote-getter for three years in a row (2004–06) in the Cable & Satellite category of their America's Best CEOs annual survey; and named Comcast as one of America's Most Shareholder-Friendly Companies in 2006.
Roberts was the recipient of the 2004 Humanitarian Award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and was the 2002 Walter Kaitz Foundation Honoree of the Year for his commitment to diversity in the cable industry. The Police Athletic League of Philadelphia honored Roberts with their 2002 award for his commitment to youth programs and community partnerships.[10]
In 2001, Roberts was awarded the USC Shoah Foundation Institute's 2011 Ambassador for Humanity Award.[11]
The Aileen K. and Brian L. Roberts Foundation was one of the largest contributors to the restoration of the Alfred W. Fleisher Memorial Synagogue at Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, named in the honor of his maternal grandfather.[12]
Maccabiah Games[edit]
Being an All-American squash player and of Jewish descent, Roberts participated in the Maccabiah Games in Israel, earning a Gold Medal with the U.S. Squash team in 2005, and Silver Medals in 1981, 1985, 1997, and 2009.[10][13] On October 21, 2012, Roberts was honored by Maccabi USA as a 'Legend of the Maccabiah.'[14]
Politics[edit]
Roberts was a founding co-chair of Philadelphia 2000, the nonpartisan host committee for the 2000 Republican National Convention. The Pennsylvania Report named Roberts to the 2003 "The Pennsylvania Report Power 75" list of influential figures in Pennsylvania politics, calling him "Pennsylvania’s most powerful businessman", and noted his influence with Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell.[15]
In 2003, Roberts was named to the PoliticsPA list of politically influential individuals.[16]
Since 2006, Roberts has donated more than $76,000 to Democratic candidates, and $13,500 to Republican candidates.[17]
In December 2009, Roberts wrote a letter to President Barack Obama, endorsing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Roberts and his wife, Aileen Kennedy Roberts, live in Philadelphia with their three children.[19] Aileen is the director of the Barnes Foundation.[20][21] Roberts' father is late Comcast founder Ralph J. Roberts, and his mother is Suzanne Roberts. In 2010, Roberts presented his mother, along with his brother Douglas and his father, Women's Image Network Awards Lifetime Achievement Award.[22][23] Roberts owns a 48 ft sloop and a 65 ft sloop, both designed by Sparkman & Stephens and named Aileen after his wife, which he sails whilst on holiday in his seasonal home on Martha's Vineyard.[24]

Comcast CEO Shows Off ‘World’s Fastest Router’ at Goldman Sachs Communacopia



Three-day New York event kicks off with heavy product demonstration, also including company’s new cable box

Tony Maglio | September 20, 2016 @ 5:58 AM




 


Brian L. Roberts has some neat new toys for Comcast’s Xfinity customers, and he used lots of stage time on Tuesday to brag about ‘em.
The chairman and chief executive officer was up early at Goldman Sachs Communacopia — the very first panel of the conference, actually. After the requisite praising of NBC broadcast for winning another 52-week season and declaring his film arm — which recently purchased DreamWorks Animation — to be “in great shape,” Roberts wanted to do a little demo. That little demo turned into a lot of it.
First up was the X1 set-top box and its remote voice recognition’s integration into Netflix. Roberts spent quite a bit of time showing off that one, debuting his shared interface and some of the cooler features one can seamlessly control.

But, as they say in showbiz, that’s not all.
Roberts boasted a bit later about his new XI5 wireless cable box, which is all wi-fi based and has 4K/HDR capabilities. Right now it’s meant for additional TVs in one’s home, but soon he believes the little guy will replace your primary one.






“I think this is the future of how we’re making cable boxes,” Roberts said of the small device, declaring it: “The best cable box we’ve ever made.”

Of course, that means one needs excellent and reliable wi-fi. Roberts then pulled out the XB6, which also handles telephone and broadband needs.
“The world’s fastest router,” were his words of praise for that one.
Lest you think we’re nitpicking or exaggerating about exactly how Roberts used much of his 42 minutes, BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield tweeted the following midway during the panel:

7 People You Never Expected to Make Bank on the DreamWorks Animation Deal (Photos)






Co-founders Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg enjoy the biggest individual stakes in DreamWork's Animation, with Katzenberg's holdings worth a whopping $408 million and Spielberg's worth $187.6 million after Comcast's takeover. But thanks to shares issued to directors and other former execs, a handful of other Hollywood names stand to make a pretty penny in the deal, too.

Jason Kilar, best known for being the CEO who built video streaming site Hulu from "Clown Co." into a legitimate force in online video, holds a stake thanks to his seat on the board. His holdings are worth nearly $1 million after the Comcast deal. 
Getty Images





Lucian Grainge, who is the head of the world's biggest music label, Universal Music Group, also holds shares because of his board seat. His stake is also nearly $1 million.
Getty Images





Investment banker Mellody Hobson is DreamWorks Animations chairman since 2012, after eight years as a director. The investment banker, who also serves on the boards for two of George Lucas' foundations, has a stake worth $4.7 million.  
Getty Images





Former Viacom CEO Tom Freston joined DreamWorks Animation's board nearly nine years ago. His stake is worth $2.7 million. 
Getty Images





Entertainment lawyer Skip Brittenham's eight years on the board have built him a stake worth $2.5 million after the Comcast deal. 
Getty Images





Ann Daly, pictured left, is a longtime exec at DreamWorks Animation, serving currently as president and previously as chief operating officer for a decade. After the Comcast deal, her stake in the company is worth $40 million.

Lew Coleman, another longtime exec at the studio, served for years as vice chairman and chief financial officer. His holdings will be worth $52.7 million when Comcast closes the deal.

Early life and education[edit]
Roberts was born into a Jewish family[3][4] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Ralph J. Roberts, the founder of Comcast Corporation, and Suzanne Fleisher, a former actress and playwright.[5] Roberts graduated from the Germantown Academy and earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1981, and immediately began working for Comcast.[6]
Career[edit]
Roberts is Chairman and CEO of Comcast Corporation, and personally controls 33 1/3% of the voting rights of the company.[7] He was named President of Comcast Corporation in 1990 when the company had $657 million in annual revenue. Comcast Corporation’s annual revenue has since grown to $74.5 billion.[2]
Roberts is Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA), and a former treasurer.[8] Roberts served as Chairman of NCTA from 1995 to 1996, when the landmark deregulatory 1996 Telecommunications Act became law.
In 2014, Roberts received US$26.4 million in compensation,[9] and in 2015, his net worth was US$1.7 billion.[1]
Awards and philanthropy[edit]
Institutional Investor Magazine named Roberts as its top vote-getter for three years in a row (2004–06) in the Cable & Satellite category of their America's Best CEOs annual survey; and named Comcast as one of America's Most Shareholder-Friendly Companies in 2006.
Roberts was the recipient of the 2004 Humanitarian Award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and was the 2002 Walter Kaitz Foundation Honoree of the Year for his commitment to diversity in the cable industry. The Police Athletic League of Philadelphia honored Roberts with their 2002 award for his commitment to youth programs and community partnerships.[10]
In 2001, Roberts was awarded the USC Shoah Foundation Institute's 2011 Ambassador for Humanity Award.[11]
The Aileen K. and Brian L. Roberts Foundation was one of the largest contributors to the restoration of the Alfred W. Fleisher Memorial Synagogue at Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, named in the honor of his maternal grandfather.[12]
Maccabiah Games[edit]
Being an All-American squash player and of Jewish descent, Roberts participated in the Maccabiah Games in Israel, earning a Gold Medal with the U.S. Squash team in 2005, and Silver Medals in 1981, 1985, 1997, and 2009.[10][13] On October 21, 2012, Roberts was honored by Maccabi USA as a 'Legend of the Maccabiah.'[14]
Politics[edit]
Roberts was a founding co-chair of Philadelphia 2000, the nonpartisan host committee for the 2000 Republican National Convention. The Pennsylvania Report named Roberts to the 2003 "The Pennsylvania Report Power 75" list of influential figures in Pennsylvania politics, calling him "Pennsylvania’s most powerful businessman", and noted his influence with Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell.[15]
In 2003, Roberts was named to the PoliticsPA list of politically influential individuals.[16]
Since 2006, Roberts has donated more than $76,000 to Democratic candidates, and $13,500 to Republican candidates.[17]
In December 2009, Roberts wrote a letter to President Barack Obama, endorsing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[18]
Personal life[edit]
Roberts and his wife, Aileen Kennedy Roberts, live in Philadelphia with their three children.[19] Aileen is the director of the Barnes Foundation.[20][21] Roberts' father is late Comcast founder Ralph J. Roberts, and his mother is Suzanne Roberts. In 2010, Roberts presented his mother, along with his brother Douglas and his father, Women's Image Network Awards Lifetime Achievement Award.[22][23] Roberts owns a 48 ft sloop and a 65 ft sloop, both designed by Sparkman & Stephens and named Aileen after his wife, which he sails whilst on holiday in his seasonal home on Martha's Vineyard.[24]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

We did some soul-searching. Was the cable industry obsolete? Was it an opportune time to get out? Our conclusion was that if you rebuilt your system with this new fiber-optic coaxial hybrid - which we now call broadband - the glass was half full, not half empty. We could compete.
