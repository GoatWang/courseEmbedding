  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - July 17, 2017 - Stocks in this week's article include  H&R Block Inc.  (NYSE:  HRB  - Free Report  ), Lazard Ltd.  (NYSE:  LAZ  - Free Report  ), Westlake Chemical Corporation  (NYSE:  WLK  - Free Report  ), Aetna Inc.  (NYSE:  AET  - Free Report  ) and Republic Services Inc.  (NYSE:  RSG  - Free Report  ).  Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research:    5 Market-Beating Dividend Stocks for Steady Growth   Though the stock market are at all-time highs, geopolitics, Washington turmoil, and Fed's dovish views make dividend investing a perfect choice. These cash payouts are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk. In particular, stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pay high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation.   Why Dividend Growth Stocks?    Dividend growth stocks offer the best of both worlds -- potential for capital appreciation and rising income even in a volatile market. This is because these stocks belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, while simultaneously offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.    Dividend growth reflects a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth stocks quality and promising investments for the long term. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that hike is likely in the future.    Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.    As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.   5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  : This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.   5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero:  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.   5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero:  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.   Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero:  This represents the rate at which a company's earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.   Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry:  A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.   52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight):  This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.   Top Zacks Rank:  Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.   VGM Style Score  of B or better:  This is simply a weighted combination of Value, Growth and Momentum. This when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offers the best upside potential.    Here are five of the 28 stocks that fit the bill:   H&R Block Inc.  (NYSE:  HRB  - Free Report  ):    This Missouri-based H&R Block is a diversified company involved in tax return preparation, electronic filing of income tax returns and other tax-related services. The company has seen strong earnings estimate revision of 23 cents over the past 90 days for this fiscal year and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 8.95% in three of the past four quarters. It has a VGM Style Score of A and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .   Lazard Ltd.

The company has seen solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents over the past 90 days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 11.25%. It has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Style Score of A.

The LG Q8 isn't a groundbreaking new phone, but rather a "mid-range flagship" that packs everything that was great about the V20 into a device that's smaller.In terms of cameras, LG is sticking with the same 13-megapixel/8-megapixel dual camera combination that appeared in the LG V20. "There's a metal body with IP67 waterproofing, Quad DAC, 4GB of RAM, 5.2" QHD panel with a secondary display 32GB internal storage.

Westlake Chemical Corporation's (WLK) Buy Rating Reiterated at Cowen and Company
Analysts await Spark Networks Inc (NYSEMKT:LOV) to report earnings on August, 9. 27,205 were reported by Cookson Peirce And Co. The stock of Westlake Chemical Corporation (NYSE:WLK) has "Buy" rating given on Wednesday, June 15 by SunTrust.
Unfortunately, it's unclear when or if the LG Q8 will be sold outside of Italy, which is where the phone has been made official. The device also features a fingerprint recognition button for biometric security. The handset should be able to survive up to 1.5 meters underwater for up to half an hour. The main camera clocks in at 16MP, but the secondary 8MP lens will allow for wide-angle shots that have a 135-degree field of view. There's a 5MP selfie camera on the front with a wide lens (120°) that can record 1080p video. While the LG Q6 shared a design with the LG G6, the LG Q8 looks like a shrunken version of the LG V20.On the connectivity front, the nano-SIM based LG Q8 offers various connectivity options including 4G LTE, Bluetooth v4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac (dual band), GPS/A-GPS/GLONASS, DLNA, IR blaster, Miracast, NFC, FM Radio with RDS, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a USB Type-C port for superfast charging and data transfer.
