History[edit]
In 1986, Celgene, originally a unit of the Celanese Corporation, was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation.
In August 2000, Celgene acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held company that searches for and develops pharmaceuticals that regulate disease-related genes. Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now operates as Celgene Research San Diego, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.
In December 2002, Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing technology for the recovery of stem cells from placental tissues following the completion of full-term successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene.
In 2006 Celegene certified McKesson Specialty, a specialty pharmacy, as one of a select group of RevAssist(SM) Program contract pharmacies to launch lenalidomide (trade name Revlimid). As a specialty drug, lenalidomide requires special handling and is therefore only available through the RevAssist program, a unique distribution network employing only certified, contracted specialty pharmacies.[4]
In March 2008, Celgene closed its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pharmion Corporation.
In December 2009, Celgene announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.[5]
In 2010 Celgene looked to relocate its UK headquarters from Riverside House in Windsor to a new development Stockley Park, Uxbridge.[6] In June 2010 Celgene Corporation and Abraxis BioScience Inc. jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Abraxis BioScience.[7]
In January 2012, Celgene and Avila Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing, announced a definitive merger agreement under which Celgene Corporation will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. for $350 million in cash, plus up to $195 million for milestones contingent upon the development and regulatory approval of AVL-292, as well as up to $380 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon the development and approval of candidates generated from the Avilomics platform.[8]
Citing a market capitalization of US$67 billion, and stock appreciation of 107%, Celgene was Forbes Magazine's number 2 ranked drug company of 2013.[9]
In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer stem cell therapeutic development agreement encompassing demcizumab and five other biologics from OnoMed's pipeline.[10] Also in 2014, Sutro Biopharma entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Celgene Corporation to discover and develop multispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). This new agreement follows the December 2012 collaboration between the two companies and focuses on the field of immuno-oncology, while further broadening the Sutro platform for discovery, development, and manufacture of best-in-class biotherapeutics.[11]
In April 2015, Celgene announced it would commence a collaboration with Astrazeneca, worth $450 million, studying their Phase III immuno-oncology drug candidate MEDI4736.[12] Later in the same month Celgene announced it would acquire Quanticel for up to $485 million aimed at enhancing their cancer drug pipeline through Quanticels epigenetic modifier targeting applications.[13] In June 2015 Celgene announced it had licensed Lyceras RORgamma agonist portfolio for up to $105 million and continue to develop its Phase I lead compound LYC-30937 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.[14] In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Receptos for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.[15] News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.
In May 2016, the company announced it would launch partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, developing metabolic immuno-oncology therapies. The deal could net more than $1 billion for Agios.[16]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire Delinia for $775 million, increasing the company's autoimmune disease therapy offerings.[17]

In March 2016, Bob Hugin, the company's long serving CEO, retired his position and took the role of executive chairman.[18] Bob Hugin was succeeded in the CEO role by Mark Alles.[18] At the same time, Jacqualyn Fouse was named as the company's president and COO; Fouse had joined the company in 2010 as the CFO.[18] Effective June 30, 2017, Dr. Fouse will purportedly step down and be succeeded by Scott Smith, president of the company's Global Inflammation & Immunology Franchise, who joined the company in 2008.[18]

Product-related history[edit]
In July 1998, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Thalamid for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL.
In April 2000, Celgene reached an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to license d-MPH, Celgene's chirally pure version of RITALIN. The FDA subsequently granted approval to market d-MPH, or Focalin, in November 2001.
In December 2005, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
In May 2006, Celgene received approval for Thalamid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
In June 2007, Celgene received full marketing authorization for Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy by the European Commission.
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust allegations[edit]
In 2009, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories requested, and Celgene refused to provide, a samples of Celgene's anticancer drug THALOMID® (thalidomide). Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions.
Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies.
Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® (thalidomide) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions.[20]

In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer stem cell therapeutic development agreement encompassing demcizumab and five other biologics from OnoMed's pipeline.[10] Also in 2014, Sutro Biopharma entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Celgene Corporation to discover and develop multispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). This new agreement follows the December 2012 collaboration between the two companies and focuses on the field of immuno-oncology, while further broadening the Sutro platform for discovery, development, and manufacture of best-in-class biotherapeutics.[11]
In April 2015, Celgene announced it would commence a collaboration with Astrazeneca, worth $450 million, studying their Phase III immuno-oncology drug candidate MEDI4736.[12] Later in the same month Celgene announced it would acquire Quanticel for up to $485 million aimed at enhancing their cancer drug pipeline through Quanticels epigenetic modifier targeting applications.[13] In June 2015 Celgene announced it had licensed Lyceras RORgamma agonist portfolio for up to $105 million and continue to develop its Phase I lead compound LYC-30937 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.[14] In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Receptos for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.[15] News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.
In May 2016, the company announced it would launch partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, developing metabolic immuno-oncology therapies. The deal could net more than $1 billion for Agios.[16]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire Delinia for $775 million, increasing the company's autoimmune disease therapy offerings.[17]

Product-related history[edit]
In July 1998, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Thalamid for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL.
In April 2000, Celgene reached an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to license d-MPH, Celgene's chirally pure version of RITALIN. The FDA subsequently granted approval to market d-MPH, or Focalin, in November 2001.
In December 2005, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
In May 2006, Celgene received approval for Thalamid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
In June 2007, Celgene received full marketing authorization for Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy by the European Commission.
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust allegations[edit]
In 2009, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories requested, and Celgene refused to provide, a samples of Celgene's anticancer drug THALOMID® (thalidomide). Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions.
Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies.
Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® (thalidomide) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions.[20]

History[edit]
In 1986, Celgene, originally a unit of the Celanese Corporation, was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation.
In August 2000, Celgene acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held company that searches for and develops pharmaceuticals that regulate disease-related genes. Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now operates as Celgene Research San Diego, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.
In December 2002, Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing technology for the recovery of stem cells from placental tissues following the completion of full-term successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene.
In 2006 Celegene certified McKesson Specialty, a specialty pharmacy, as one of a select group of RevAssist(SM) Program contract pharmacies to launch lenalidomide (trade name Revlimid). As a specialty drug, lenalidomide requires special handling and is therefore only available through the RevAssist program, a unique distribution network employing only certified, contracted specialty pharmacies.[4]
In March 2008, Celgene closed its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pharmion Corporation.
In December 2009, Celgene announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.[5]
In 2010 Celgene looked to relocate its UK headquarters from Riverside House in Windsor to a new development Stockley Park, Uxbridge.[6] In June 2010 Celgene Corporation and Abraxis BioScience Inc. jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Abraxis BioScience.[7]
In January 2012, Celgene and Avila Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing, announced a definitive merger agreement under which Celgene Corporation will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. for $350 million in cash, plus up to $195 million for milestones contingent upon the development and regulatory approval of AVL-292, as well as up to $380 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon the development and approval of candidates generated from the Avilomics platform.[8]
Citing a market capitalization of US$67 billion, and stock appreciation of 107%, Celgene was Forbes Magazine's number 2 ranked drug company of 2013.[9]
In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer stem cell therapeutic development agreement encompassing demcizumab and five other biologics from OnoMed's pipeline.[10] Also in 2014, Sutro Biopharma entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Celgene Corporation to discover and develop multispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). This new agreement follows the December 2012 collaboration between the two companies and focuses on the field of immuno-oncology, while further broadening the Sutro platform for discovery, development, and manufacture of best-in-class biotherapeutics.[11]
In April 2015, Celgene announced it would commence a collaboration with Astrazeneca, worth $450 million, studying their Phase III immuno-oncology drug candidate MEDI4736.[12] Later in the same month Celgene announced it would acquire Quanticel for up to $485 million aimed at enhancing their cancer drug pipeline through Quanticels epigenetic modifier targeting applications.[13] In June 2015 Celgene announced it had licensed Lyceras RORgamma agonist portfolio for up to $105 million and continue to develop its Phase I lead compound LYC-30937 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.[14] In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Receptos for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.[15] News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.
In May 2016, the company announced it would launch partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, developing metabolic immuno-oncology therapies. The deal could net more than $1 billion for Agios.[16]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire Delinia for $775 million, increasing the company's autoimmune disease therapy offerings.[17]

History[edit]
In 1986, Celgene, originally a unit of the Celanese Corporation, was spun off as an independent company following the merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation.
In August 2000, Celgene acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held company that searches for and develops pharmaceuticals that regulate disease-related genes. Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now operates as Celgene Research San Diego, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation.
In December 2002, Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis, a privately held New Jersey-based biotherapeutics company and cord blood banking business, which is developing technology for the recovery of stem cells from placental tissues following the completion of full-term successful pregnancies. Anthrogenesis now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene.
In 2006 Celegene certified McKesson Specialty, a specialty pharmacy, as one of a select group of RevAssist(SM) Program contract pharmacies to launch lenalidomide (trade name Revlimid). As a specialty drug, lenalidomide requires special handling and is therefore only available through the RevAssist program, a unique distribution network employing only certified, contracted specialty pharmacies.[4]
In March 2008, Celgene closed its $2.9 billion acquisition of Pharmion Corporation.
In December 2009, Celgene announced the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals.[5]
In 2010 Celgene looked to relocate its UK headquarters from Riverside House in Windsor to a new development Stockley Park, Uxbridge.[6] In June 2010 Celgene Corporation and Abraxis BioScience Inc. jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement in which Celgene has agreed to acquire Abraxis BioScience.[7]
In January 2012, Celgene and Avila Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company developing targeted covalent drugs that treat diseases through protein silencing, announced a definitive merger agreement under which Celgene Corporation will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire Avila Therapeutics, Inc. for $350 million in cash, plus up to $195 million for milestones contingent upon the development and regulatory approval of AVL-292, as well as up to $380 million in potential milestone payments contingent upon the development and approval of candidates generated from the Avilomics platform.[8]
Citing a market capitalization of US$67 billion, and stock appreciation of 107%, Celgene was Forbes Magazine's number 2 ranked drug company of 2013.[9]
In 2014, Celgene and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals entered into a cancer stem cell therapeutic development agreement encompassing demcizumab and five other biologics from OnoMed's pipeline.[10] Also in 2014, Sutro Biopharma entered into a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Celgene Corporation to discover and develop multispecific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). This new agreement follows the December 2012 collaboration between the two companies and focuses on the field of immuno-oncology, while further broadening the Sutro platform for discovery, development, and manufacture of best-in-class biotherapeutics.[11]
In April 2015, Celgene announced it would commence a collaboration with Astrazeneca, worth $450 million, studying their Phase III immuno-oncology drug candidate MEDI4736.[12] Later in the same month Celgene announced it would acquire Quanticel for up to $485 million aimed at enhancing their cancer drug pipeline through Quanticels epigenetic modifier targeting applications.[13] In June 2015 Celgene announced it had licensed Lyceras RORgamma agonist portfolio for up to $105 million and continue to develop its Phase I lead compound LYC-30937 for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The licensing opportunity gives Celgene the option to acquire Lycera.[14] In July 2015, the company announced it would acquire Receptos for $7.2 billion in a move to strengthen the company's inflammation and immunology areas.[15] News of the deal sent Celgene shares up 5.7% in after hours trading.
In May 2016, the company announced it would launch partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, developing metabolic immuno-oncology therapies. The deal could net more than $1 billion for Agios.[16]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire Delinia for $775 million, increasing the company's autoimmune disease therapy offerings.[17]

Product-related history[edit]
In July 1998, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Thalamid for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL.
In April 2000, Celgene reached an agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to license d-MPH, Celgene's chirally pure version of RITALIN. The FDA subsequently granted approval to market d-MPH, or Focalin, in November 2001.
In December 2005, Celgene received approval from the FDA to market Revlimid for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
In May 2006, Celgene received approval for Thalamid in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
In June 2007, Celgene received full marketing authorization for Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy by the European Commission.
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust allegations[edit]
In 2009, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories requested, and Celgene refused to provide, a samples of Celgene's anticancer drug THALOMID® (thalidomide). Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions.
Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies.
Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® (thalidomide) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions.[20]

Immunomedics Appoints Dr. Sol J. Barer Special Advisor to the Chairman




















April 22, 2016 07:00 ET

 | Source: Immunomedics






MORRIS PLAINS, N.J., April  22, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immunomedics, Inc. (Nasdaq:IMMU) today announced that Dr. Sol J. Barer has been appointed Special Advisor to the Chairman, and will work in this capacity to strengthen the Company’s business and commercial development activities. Dr. Barer is Managing Partner of SJ Barer Consulting. From 1987 to 2011, he served in various senior management roles at Celgene Corporation, including Executive Chairman, Chairman and CEO, and President and COO. Prior thereto, he was a founder of the biotechnology group at Celanese Corporation, which then became Celgene. Dr. Barer serves on the Board of Directors of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Contrafect, Amicus Therapeutics, and Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, in addition to four other healthcare companies. He received a Ph.D. in organic and physical chemistry from Rutgers University, and a B.S. in chemistry from Brooklyn College of the City of New York. Dr. David M. Goldenberg, Chairman and Founder of Immunomedics, commented: “The Board of Directors and I are delighted and honored to have such a successful and seasoned biopharmaceutical executive join our team. This is a pivotal time for the Company as we advance our lead antibody-drug conjugate, sacituzumab govitecan, in partnering efforts towards eventual commercialization in the therapy of patients with triple-negative breast cancer as well as other major cancer types.” “We look forward to Dr. Barer playing an important role in the Company’s developments,” Dr. Goldenberg added. Dr. Barer remarked: “I have observed Immunomedics for many years, since Celgene and Immunomedics both were neighbors in Warren, NJ. I admire the diverse and innovative scientific platforms being developed, and look forward to assisting in strategic development and commercialization of their novel antibody-drug conjugates, as well as immuno-oncology products in early development.” “It is critical to bring these and other compounds in development to the benefit of cancer patients as soon as possible,” Dr. Barer commented further. About ImmunomedicsImmunomedics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing monoclonal antibody-based products for the targeted treatment of cancer, autoimmune disorders and other serious diseases. Immunomedics’ advanced proprietary technologies allow the Company to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled or “naked” form, or conjugated with radioactive isotopes, chemotherapeutics, cytokines or toxins. Using these technologies, Immunomedics has built a pipeline of eight clinical-stage product candidates. Immunomedics’ portfolio of investigational products includes antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that are designed to deliver a specific payload of a chemotherapeutic directly to the tumor while reducing overall toxic effects that are usually found with conventional administration of these chemotherapeutic agents. Immunomedics’ most advanced ADCs are sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) and labetuzumab govitecan (IMMU-130), which are in Phase 2 trials for a number of solid tumors and metastatic colorectal cancer, respectively. IMMU-132 has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA for the treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer who have failed at least 2 prior therapies for metastatic disease. Immunomedics has a research collaboration with Bayer to study epratuzumab as a thorium-227-labeled antibody. Immunomedics has other ongoing collaborations in oncology with independent cancer study groups. The IntreALL Inter-European study group is conducting a large, randomized Phase 3 trial combining epratuzumab with chemotherapy in children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia at clinical sites in Australia, Europe, and Israel. Immunomedics also has a number of other product candidates that target solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, as well as other diseases, in various stages of clinical and preclinical development. These include combination therapies involving its antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies targeting cancers and infectious diseases as T-cell redirecting immunotherapies, as well as bispecific antibodies for next-generation cancer and autoimmune disease therapies, created using its patented DOCK-AND-LOCK® protein conjugation technology. The Company believes that its portfolio of intellectual property, which includes approximately 287 active patents in the United States and more than 400 foreign patents, protects its product candidates and technologies. For additional information on the Company, please visit its website at www.immunomedics.com. The information on its website does not, however, form a part of this press release. This release, in addition to historical information, may contain forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements, including statements regarding clinical trials (including the funding therefor, outcomes, timing or associated costs), out-licensing arrangements (including the timing and amount of contingent payments), forecasts of future operating results, potential collaborations, and capital raising activities, involve significant risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied herein. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, new product development (including clinical trials outcome and regulatory requirements/actions), the Company’s dependence on business collaborations in order to further develop our products and finance our operations, the risk that we or any of our collaborators may be unable to secure regulatory approval of and market our drug candidates, risks associated with the outcome of pending litigation and competitive risks to marketed products, and availability of required financing and other sources of funds on acceptable terms, if at all, as well as the risks discussed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is not under any obligation, and the Company expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.For More Information:

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.
