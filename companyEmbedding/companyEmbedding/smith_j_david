Chocolate Cone Coating, #10 can

Request Product Spec Sheet



SKU: 2700022700


Brand: J. Hungerford Smith
						
Description

							Chocolate Cone Coating is a must-have for traditional ice cream operators and a unique opportunity to add specialty dessert items for full service operators.  Once the product is heated, any frozen treat may be dipped and served.  Chocolate Cone Coating has the required cone coating crunch that finishes with a smooth cocoa flavor.
						
Benefits

- Chocolate Cone Coating provides a warm cocoa color and a sweet chocolate taste.

- Product hardens on frozen items in a few seconds for quick and easy preparation time.

- It coats frozen products well enough so a second dip is not required, saving food cost.

				The Workshops of David T. Smith is eager to meet the custom kitchen or furniture needs for your project. We understand what an exciting yet overwhelming process custom design can be, so we are here to expertly guide and assist you. Get creative, expand your boundaries, and reinvent your kitchen or other space by following your imagination rather than changing trends.Our work includes over 450 kitchens all over the U.S. and we use modern methods for design and production, as well as for communicating with our customers. It is a simple and exciting process! Many customers are amazed to see their basic sketch or idea transformed into a CAD drawing and fully rendered within minutes while meeting with us on the web from hundreds of miles away. This means that custom furniture and kitchens can now be viewed practically as finished products before they are even built so you can be confident that you will love your David T. Smith kitchen or furniture piece.Please feel free to browse through our projects. You'll find that we do beautiful, hand-made, quality work ranging from primitive (what we call "collected") to contemporary (often monochromatic or white kitchen) styles. If you have any questions or would like to talk about your project, don't hesitate to send me a message using the green "Contact Me" button above.- David T. Smith

Commented: Countertop is very nice This was a top that was used in a laundry room. The client wanted a more primitive look so we used poplar with a Time Worn Finish. We usually use cherry or curly maple for  our kitchen counter tops.

Commented: Refrigerator This is a "fully integrated" fridge. it is made for a door like this. They cost more than a regular fridge. You can't  do this with a regular fridge.

Commented: How are these counter tops finished and what are they made of? They are curly maple wood counter tops, finished with mineral oil finish for food use. David T. Smith

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Morrow, OH professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Morrow, OH portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Morrow, OH professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Morrow

What does a Morrow kitchen designer or bathroom designer do? A kitchen and bath design professional in Morrow, OH knows to take all of these crucial points into consideration and can help plan the layout, materials and overall look and feel of either of these rooms in your home. You can find more kitchen & bath designers in Cincinnati, Middletown, Mason, Lebanon and Springboro.Kitchen designers, as well as bathroom designers, are constantly staying on top of trends in the ever-changing industry. The designer also knows the best layout for your room, and can configure the layout for optimal functionality and utilization of the space. In the kitchen the refrigerator, stove and sink should be laid out in relation to one another, and it should be seamless and easy to move from one to the other. A Morrow kitchen and bath designer will know how to work with a contractor and architect to plan the flow of the room to work best for your needs. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of kitchen & bath designers: Kitchen & Bath Fixtures, Appliances, Tile, Stone & Countertops, Cabinets & Cabinetry, Woodworkers & Carpenters.Before you talk to bath and kitchen designers in Morrow, OH, consider how you will use the room. For your bathroom, is it necessary to have a bathtub for bathing kids or pets, or would a shower suffice? Perhaps all you need is a half bath for downstairs or a smaller guest bath for occasional use. Similarly, for kitchen renovations consider your cooking habits. Do you eat out every night but need a space to entertain in? If so, a smaller kitchen might be fine for you, with a space devoted to wine storage or a bar, whereas others might prefer a bigger stove or extra cabinets. When interviewing Morrow kitchen and bath designers, make sure to share these habits so they can best fit the room to suit your needs.Questions to ask a Morrow, OH kitchen and bath design professional: May I see your portfolio? What type of education and experience do you have in kitchen design and/or bathroom design? How many plans do you provide? How long will the redesign take to complete? Will you provide any cost-saving ideas? Do you design ecofriendly kitchens? Or can you add in green kitchen or bathroom features?Find a Morrow kitchen designer or bathroom designer on Houzz.
