Q. What services does IBEX Wealth Advisors provide?
IBEX Wealth Advisors seeks to deliver disciplined asset management strategies grounded in clarity, consistency and conviction by helping you build, manage and transfer wealth through long-term financial planning. As independent advisors, we offer objective advice across the full range of your wealth management needs, including retirement planning, insurance planning, education funding and estate planning.
Return to the top of the page
Q. What types of clients does IBEX Wealth Advisors serve and do you have a minimum account size?
IBEX Wealth Advisors serves a broad range of individuals, families and business owners with diverse needs and financial situations. While we find that clients with investable assets of at least $500,000.00 benefit the most from our investment and financial planning capabilities, we may waive our minimum relationship size for new clients who are either related to or referred to us by existing clients.
Return to the top of the page
Q. What is your investment philosophy and approach?
We employ a highly personalized approach as we seek to preserve and grow what matters most to you and your family. We recognize the importance of getting to know you, your financial needs, goals and lifestyle. That is the foundation we use to help you define and prioritize your long-term financial objectives and develop a comprehensive strategy that seeks to help you pursue your goals. Throughout our planning process you benefit from our experience, education and ongoing professional training. You can count on IBEX Wealth Advisors to provide you with thoughtful financial insights, honest communication, long-term planning and personal service; the elements we consider essential for building and nurturing lasting relationships.
The convictions that support our investment recommendations are based on objective analysis of individual securities, investment sectors and economic and market indicators, among other criteria. Our open-architecture investment platform and stringent due diligence provides us with access to the full universe of securities in constructing your portfolio. We leverage the relationships with our outside investment and research partners to employ a strict, highly disciplined investment screening process that results in a recommended list of select securities. Securities on our recommended list must continue to meet strict criteria over time to remain on the list. Our approach to investment planning incorporates:





Asset Allocation
Portfolio Design
Portfolio income analysis




Portfolio Management
Tax Strategies
Risk Management





No strategy ensures a profit or protects against loss. Investing involves risk including possible loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Return to the top of the page
Q. Will I work with a specific advisor at the firm?
While your lead advisor will be your primary point of contact, we leverage the knowledge and experience of our entire team in resolving financial challenges and seeking the best opportunities for your needs. Depending on your situation and goals, you may work with more than one advisor to ensure you have access to the right experience in specialized areas such as estate or insurance planning or developing a business exit strategy. In addition, our highly skilled administrative staff will interact with you, preparing forms and account paperwork, answering routine inquiries and scheduling appointments.
Return to the top of the page
Q. How often do you conduct client account reviews?
While we continually monitor your financial plan and investment strategies throughout the year, we conduct formal account reviews with each client at least annually and whenever you request a meeting with us. Based on your specific needs and situation, account reviews can be scheduled at different intervals throughout the year. We encourage all of our clients to proactively contact us whenever significant changes in their lives take place, such as a marriage, birth, job change, loss of a loved one or other circumstances which could impact your financial strategy.
Return to the top of the page
Q. Do you offer discretionary asset management services?
Yes. In fact, a majority of our clients come to us seeking discretionary asset management services. However, we also manage a number of client portfolios on a non-discretionary basis. We work closely with each client to establish an appropriate risk level. Clients seeking discretionary asset management sign documents assigning us discretion to make appropriate securities purchase and sale decisions without contacting them prior to each trade. This enables us to make investment decisions on your behalf, and aligned with your goals and risk tolerance, in what we believe is a more timely, efficient, and effective manner. Discretion does not authorize us to withdraw any monies or securities from your account.
Return to the top of the page
Q. How do I know that investment decisions will be made with my best interests in mind?
As an independent Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), our advisors have a fiduciary duty toward you, our client. A fiduciary duty is a legal obligation to always act in your best interest, placing your interests ahead of our own. Not all financial advisors, planners or broker-dealers have this legal obligation to their clients. We encourage prospective clients to always ask a potential advisor if they have a fiduciary duty and to provide evidence of their status as a fiduciary advisor in writing. To learn more about IBEX Wealth Advisor fiduciary duty to clients, Download our ADV Brochure.
Return to the top of the page
Q. How are you compensated?
Our main source of compensation is in the form of an asset-based advisory fee. We believe that the advisory relationship works better if our compensation is asset-based instead of commission-based. This approach helps reduce conflicts of interest and more closely aligns client and advisor goals. If our clients assets grow, our income grows; the reverse also holds true. We have an incentive to treat the assets as if they were our own.
In the case of insurance and annuity products, advisors are paid by commission from the insurance company. Where possible, our advisors take a level commission; this means we are paid on an on-going basis to provide service for the life of the product, rather than receive a large commission up-front.
Return to the top of the page
Q. How do you set your fees?
There are many factors that can influence the advisory fee that we charge such as the total amount of assets involved, the number of investment strategies utilized, the investment objectives, and other individual requirements. We appreciate the opportunity to meet and explain further the services we can provide and the costs for such.
Return to the top of the page
Q. Where can I find regulatory disclosures pertaining to IBEX Wealth Advisors?
We provide our ADV Brochure to all prospective clients in the first meeting. The ADV form ('ADV' is an abbreviation for 'advisor') is a form filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) by Registered Investment Advisors. The form contains information about our assets under management, types of fee arrangements, types of investments, and other business activities.
All of our advisors are regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), through LPL Financial. The public may review our individual advisor's records through FINRA's BrokerCheck website.
Click on Become a Client to access additional information and documents.
Return to the top of the page
Q. Does IBEX Wealth Advisors have any revenue sharing agreements in place?
No. We do not have any revenue sharing agreements with any other professionals. This means that we do not receive any form of compensation for referring you to a particular accountant, attorney or other professional outside of our office.
Return to the top of the page
Q. How do your advisors remain current with industry and regulatory changes?
At IBEX Wealth Advisors, we place great emphasis on our own continuing education for the benefit of our clients. Based on their specific industry designations, registrations and licenses, our advisors are subject to continuing education requirements by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards and FINRA, among others.Our advisors also attend industry conferences and workshops regarding the financial markets, tax policy, estate planning, regulatory changes, and other topics.
Return to the top of the page
Q. How will you keep my personal and confidential information private?

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
