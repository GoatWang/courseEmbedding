Biometric Tokenization[edit]
Biometric tokenization is a security protocol in which sensitive biometric data required for authentication is encrypted and substituted with a non-sensitive equivalent (referred to as a token) which is then used for authentication through a symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic channel.
Systems based on biometric tokenization rely on the decentralized storage of biometric data on the client-side of an authentication channel - in users’ connected devices - as opposed to a centralized repository such as a server-side database. Unlike the use of passwords, which are compared against a centralized database of many users’ passwords, biometric tokenization allows users to authorize transactions by verifying their unique biometric template on their own local device - which is then used to sign a cryptographic challenge validated on a server. Rather than exposing sensitive biometric authentication data to the internet, user credentials are stored locally and tokenized - preventing malicious 3rd parties from re-using compromised credentials. By combining the user experience of biometric tokenization with the strength of public key cryptography, HYPR provides a decentralized biometric authentication scheme to replace the use of centralized password-based systems.[1][2][3][8]
The result of implementing biometric tokenization is an “inverted” authentication channel in which hackers are unable to gain credentials by attacking a centralized repository of biometrics and are forced to target individual user devices. By forcing malicious attackers to divert attention from a centralized validation server to many client-side devices, biometric tokenization decreases the viability of an attack on the client-server authentication channel, rendering the common large-scale server-side data breach an unscalable attack vector.[1][8][9]
According to HYPR Corp, HYPR technology is designed based on the following principles:[2][8]

Authentication channels should not be based on centralized biometrics storage.
Users may have the option to choose the biometric authenticators they would like to utilize.
Isolation of biometric data from the rich operating system on a user device.
Relying parties may have the capability to set policies to use biometric authenticators.

HYPR platform[edit]
The HYPR platform provides enterprises an end-to-end suite of software, firmware and hardware to enable decentralized biometric security for data across mobile, desktop and IoT systems. As an interoperable solution, users may choose from a variety of biometric authentication methods, by leveraging existing fingerprint sensors, cameras and microphones on mobile devices. HYPR is available as a cross platform SDK[9][10] for BYOD deployment, or as a tamper proof security token for mission critical settings.[3][8][11][12]
The HYPR biometric security platform seeks to secure the use of biometrics and to enhance user experience through password-less authentication. Users of applications with embedded HYPR technology do not need to create, remember, securely store, or reset passwords because there aren’t any passwords required for authentication.[1][8]
Software, firmware and hardware[edit]

HYPR-1 (software): The HYPR-1 SDK (Software Development Kit) can be embedded into applications to convert any mobile device into a biometric authenticator. HYPR-1 enables developers and enterprises to deploy a secure password-less experience across internal and consumer facing applications by enabling users to log in with tokenized biometrics through fingerprint sensors, device cameras and microphones. HYPR-1 adheres to the FIDO UAF authentication standards specified by the Fast IDentity Online Alliance (FIDO). The HYPR-1 validation server can be implemented On Premises or as a cloud-based deployment.[2][3]
HYPR-2 (firmware): A firmware iteration of the HYPR platform designed to secure use cases within the Internet of Things. Device manufacturers embed the HYPR-2 firmware to extend secure password-less authentication to IoT endpoints - with or without an Internet connection. In doing so, devices such as locks for residential or commercial physical access as well as connected automobiles may leverage interoperable biometric tokenization protocols for user authentication. HYPR-2 based authentication occurs over WIFI, over Bluetooth low energy (BLE) or Near field communication (NFC).[2]
HYPR-3 (hardware): A FIPS 140-2 Level 3 tamper-proof security token that contains a fingerprint sensor and enables password-less login for users in mission-critical settings where consumer-facing devices are prohibited. The proprietary device communicates using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and adheres to TOTP (RFC6238) standards and the FIDO U2F authentication specifications designated by the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance.[2][9][13][14]

History[edit]
HYPR Corp was founded in 2014 in New York City by a team of security researchers with $800,000 in private seed capital before concluding a $3 million growth funding round in October 2016 from New York based RTP Ventures and Boldstart Ventures, and Taiwan-based Mesh Ventures.[15] HYPR Corp is a working group member of the FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance, a consortium of global enterprises working towards open standards for strong authentication.
The company’s biometric security technology was unveiled at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2015 in Las Vegas. The HYPR platform was featured as one of the top 10 best technologies of CES 2015 by ZDNet[16] and has gone on to be implemented by enterprises across banking, healthcare and e-commerce verticals. HYPR Corp aims to differentiate its technology by providing enterprise customers an end-to-end solution - complete with interoperable software, firmware and hardware necessary to deploy biometric security at scale.

HYPR platform[edit]
The HYPR platform provides enterprises an end-to-end suite of software, firmware and hardware to enable decentralized biometric security for data across mobile, desktop and IoT systems. As an interoperable solution, users may choose from a variety of biometric authentication methods, by leveraging existing fingerprint sensors, cameras and microphones on mobile devices. HYPR is available as a cross platform SDK[9][10] for BYOD deployment, or as a tamper proof security token for mission critical settings.[3][8][11][12]
The HYPR biometric security platform seeks to secure the use of biometrics and to enhance user experience through password-less authentication. Users of applications with embedded HYPR technology do not need to create, remember, securely store, or reset passwords because there aren’t any passwords required for authentication.[1][8]
Software, firmware and hardware[edit]

HYPR-1 (software): The HYPR-1 SDK (Software Development Kit) can be embedded into applications to convert any mobile device into a biometric authenticator. HYPR-1 enables developers and enterprises to deploy a secure password-less experience across internal and consumer facing applications by enabling users to log in with tokenized biometrics through fingerprint sensors, device cameras and microphones. HYPR-1 adheres to the FIDO UAF authentication standards specified by the Fast IDentity Online Alliance (FIDO). The HYPR-1 validation server can be implemented On Premises or as a cloud-based deployment.[2][3]
HYPR-2 (firmware): A firmware iteration of the HYPR platform designed to secure use cases within the Internet of Things. Device manufacturers embed the HYPR-2 firmware to extend secure password-less authentication to IoT endpoints - with or without an Internet connection. In doing so, devices such as locks for residential or commercial physical access as well as connected automobiles may leverage interoperable biometric tokenization protocols for user authentication. HYPR-2 based authentication occurs over WIFI, over Bluetooth low energy (BLE) or Near field communication (NFC).[2]
HYPR-3 (hardware): A FIPS 140-2 Level 3 tamper-proof security token that contains a fingerprint sensor and enables password-less login for users in mission-critical settings where consumer-facing devices are prohibited. The proprietary device communicates using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and adheres to TOTP (RFC6238) standards and the FIDO U2F authentication specifications designated by the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance.[2][9][13][14]

History[edit]
HYPR Corp was founded in 2014 in New York City by a team of security researchers with $800,000 in private seed capital before concluding a $3 million growth funding round in October 2016 from New York based RTP Ventures and Boldstart Ventures, and Taiwan-based Mesh Ventures.[15] HYPR Corp is a working group member of the FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance, a consortium of global enterprises working towards open standards for strong authentication.
The company’s biometric security technology was unveiled at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2015 in Las Vegas. The HYPR platform was featured as one of the top 10 best technologies of CES 2015 by ZDNet[16] and has gone on to be implemented by enterprises across banking, healthcare and e-commerce verticals. HYPR Corp aims to differentiate its technology by providing enterprise customers an end-to-end solution - complete with interoperable software, firmware and hardware necessary to deploy biometric security at scale.

Biometric Tokenization[edit]
Biometric tokenization is a security protocol in which sensitive biometric data required for authentication is encrypted and substituted with a non-sensitive equivalent (referred to as a token) which is then used for authentication through a symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic channel.
Systems based on biometric tokenization rely on the decentralized storage of biometric data on the client-side of an authentication channel - in users’ connected devices - as opposed to a centralized repository such as a server-side database. Unlike the use of passwords, which are compared against a centralized database of many users’ passwords, biometric tokenization allows users to authorize transactions by verifying their unique biometric template on their own local device - which is then used to sign a cryptographic challenge validated on a server. Rather than exposing sensitive biometric authentication data to the internet, user credentials are stored locally and tokenized - preventing malicious 3rd parties from re-using compromised credentials. By combining the user experience of biometric tokenization with the strength of public key cryptography, HYPR provides a decentralized biometric authentication scheme to replace the use of centralized password-based systems.[1][2][3][8]
The result of implementing biometric tokenization is an “inverted” authentication channel in which hackers are unable to gain credentials by attacking a centralized repository of biometrics and are forced to target individual user devices. By forcing malicious attackers to divert attention from a centralized validation server to many client-side devices, biometric tokenization decreases the viability of an attack on the client-server authentication channel, rendering the common large-scale server-side data breach an unscalable attack vector.[1][8][9]
According to HYPR Corp, HYPR technology is designed based on the following principles:[2][8]

Authentication channels should not be based on centralized biometrics storage.
Users may have the option to choose the biometric authenticators they would like to utilize.
Isolation of biometric data from the rich operating system on a user device.
Relying parties may have the capability to set policies to use biometric authenticators.

NEW YORK, July 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Passwords have proven futile for securing mission critical systems, as seen in the recent U.S. Office of Personnel Management breach. Biometric authentication provides enterprises a solution to the infosec conundrum, but developers and end-users are concerned about how customer data is stored. To address this dilemma, Biometrics-as-a-Service provider HYPR Corp. announced today the general availability of its Biometric Tokenization SDK for third party integration. 
A video overview and demonstration of the HYPR SDK is available here: https://youtu.be/gFJj0-Rag-I   
The HYPR SDK enables enterprises to seamlessly implement biometric authentication in any application. Users may leverage biometric devices, such as phones and tablets, to authenticate with fingerprint, facial or voice recognition. It includes mobile and desktop client libraries, as well as server side software, to enable biometric tokenization. Unlike other biometric security protocols, the HYPR platform allows users to authenticate actions without ever transmitting biometric data across the Internet. Rather than storing user data on a centralized server, with HYPR that data is kept securely offline. 

Works with existing infrastructure: The HYPR SDK is an "add-on" piece of software. Instead of replacing a company's authentication scheme, HYPR simply adds biometric authentication compatibility to an existing infrastructure. 
Replaces insecure passwords: The HYPR platform enables companies and their users to leverage modern-day biometric sensors on trusted consumer devices to replace password-based entry – without having to worry about storing user credentials. The biometric tokenization protocol supplied by HYPR eliminates the risk of storing biometric data online. 
Maximizes security and compliance: HYPR tokenizes biometric data and marries the convenience of a mobile biometric device with the security of advanced public key cryptography. User data never leaves the device, but authentication still takes place on the server side. 
Enables a Bring-Your-Own-Biometrics environment: HYPR is device agnostic and gives enterprise customers full control of how biometric authentication is used by their partners, employees, and customers. A bank might want to only use fingerprint readers on certain devices, but not facial recognition, for instance.
George Avetisov, CEO of HYPR Corp. said:"When we started building the HYPR platform, there was one mobile device on the market with a fingerprint reader. By the end of 2016, analysts project over a billion biometric-enabled devices will be in Internet users' hands. We're ensuring that companies are utilizing those biometric devices the right way, and that user data is kept safe.
The HYPR SDK is currently in deployment across a number of banks, which are implementing biometric security solutions for use cases ranging from internal employee authentication to their consumer-facing mobile apps. Mobile wallets and even Bitcoin platforms also are integrating HYPR to prevent payment fraud across their user base. We've also been working with IoT developers, healthcare providers and even streaming content platforms to deploy biometric authentication and eliminate account sharing."  
Kyle Prigmore, Analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group:"The proliferation of the Internet of Things has created a world of new security concerns that enterprises are largely unequipped for and are continually scrambling to address. An emerging priority for organizations is to move beyond simple password-based protocols and implement a new generation of authentication processes-namely through biometric technologies. HYPR Corp. provides a robust biometric solution that is sector-agnostic and scalable for the ever-growing IoT."
Jonathan Silverman, Director of Strategic Initiatives, Bitgo said:"Biometric authentication is key to creating a future without passwords. Our online identities across financial services and Bitcoin-based technologies rely on secure authentication - which passwords simply don't provide. Combining strong encryption with biometrics is a powerful way of tackling the password problem. I can't wait for the relief."
About HYPR                                                                                                                   HYPR is a sector agnostic platform enabling secure biometric authentication. From software developers to enterprises and device manufacturers, we're replacing the use of passwords with advanced biometric cryptography. As an end-to-end solution, HYPR is the fundamental framework for securing the Internet-of-Things. Additional information is available at: https://www.hypr.com/

Biometric Authentication Provider HYPR Corp. Named by Gartner a "Cool Vendor" Transforming Multichannel to Unified Retail Commerce






Jun 1, 2017, 9:07am EDT














NEW YORK, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today HYPR Corp., the leading innovator in decentralized biometric authentication, is announcing that the company has been named a "Cool Vendor" in Gartner's  May 2017 report, "Cool Vendors in Transforming Multichannel to Unified Retail Commerce, 2017" written by Joanne Joliet, Mirtam Burt and Kelsie Martan. The report evaluates technology that offers engaging, seamless and secure ways for retailers to serve customers. 



Gartner provides recommendations for CIOs looking to transform from multichannel to unified retail commerce including the following: 

Review and confirm your current technology's capabilities and future roadmap are aligned to deliver on your customers' expectations of the shopping experience.
Reformulate all customer cross-channel support processes to support how the customer will interact across the retailer, rather than from a pure business efficiency perspective.
Enable visibility of real-time data and dashboards across the organization to drive better customer experience and, therefore, your bottom line.
Implement new technology solutions that offer protection for web, cloud, mobile and payment solutions to optimize data security.
HYPR already secures over 15 million users across Fortune 500 enterprises in the banking, insurance, payments and IoT sectors. Founded in 2014, the company held its "hello world" at the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas where ZDNet cited the HYPR solution as one of the show's top 10 innovations alongside those of billion-dollar tech players in the legacy sphere. Now venture-backed by RTP Ventures, Boldstart Ventures and Mesh Ventures, the company is under rapid expansion and recently announced that the server component of the HYPR platform is officially FIDO® Certified. The company partners with leading enterprises introducing secure voice, face, touch, eye, palm, and behavioral recognition to consumer-facing and internal employee applications. IoT system makers represent a growing portion of the company's portfolio.  
"I'm thrilled to see Gartner identify HYPR as a Cool Vendor. As the Internet of Things takes shape around us, industry leaders are looking for powerful ways to decentralize and secure digital identity. The HYPR vision for a secure connected world built upon decentralized authentication is one that enterprises are following with great interest," said Nicholas Donofrio, IBM Fellow Emeritus; IBM Executive Vice President Innovation and Technology (Ret.), and Founder, NMD Consulting LLC.
"With household names in the banking sector already deploying HYPR to millions of users, it's for us great to see Gartner designate the company as a 'Cool Vendor'," said Ann Johnson, Vice President of the Enterprise Cybersecurity Group at Microsoft. "What they are doing for the authentication space really is cool."
"The rising number of connected devices and increasing amount of data breaches highlights the importance of biometric authentication especially within the financial space," said George Avetisov, CEO and co-founder of HYPR. "We believe the 'Cool Vendor' designation affirms HYPR's commitment to ensure biometric data remains safely offline and stored on users' local devices by leveraging decentralized authentication. We have a crack team of the best and brightest who are reinventing identity and access management. Our approach is disruptive and innovative yet to us, customer feedback and this Gartner designation validate that our solution is mature enough for user populations into the many millions."
