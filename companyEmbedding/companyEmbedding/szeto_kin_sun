Plastec Technologies Reports 2016 First Quarter Financial Results






Business Wire




May 10, 2016 4:05 PM EDT













 


















































  Closing is expected in 2016 and is contingent on certain closing conditions including SYB's receipt of external financing.   Management Comments  Mr. Kin Sun Sze-To, Chairman of Plastec, stated, "The first quarter was a strong start to 2016, as Plastec achieved higher sales, significant improvements in gross margin as a result of capturing more first-run product lines, and continued progression in maintaining costs that allowed our Company to achieve a 61.3% increase in net income in comparison with same quarter in the prior year. We are benefitting from the investments made into our operations over the past few years, which has increased our capabilities to adjust robustly to the needs of our long-term clients. We generated $10.8 million in cash from operations during the period, which is the highest quarterly total since the Company became public, and expect to continue reinvesting in our facilities in the years ahead."       Selected Financial Highlights        (USD in millions, except number of shares and per share data)        (Results and percentages rounded to the nearest tenth)                          3 months ended  March 31, 2016               3 months ended  March 31, 2015           Percentage Change     Sales         $39.6         $37.6       5.5%     Cost of Revenues         $27.9         $28.1       (0.5%)     Gross Profit         $11.7         $9.5       23.3%      Gross Profit Ratio          29.5%         25.3%       4.2 pts                                 Income from Operations         $7.1         $5.3       32.2%      Operating Margin          17.8%         14.2%       3.6 pts                                 Net Income         $7.2         $4.5       61.3%      Net Margin          18.3%         11.9%       6.4 pts                                 Weighted Average Number of Diluted Shares Outstanding         12,938,128         12,938,128           Diluted EPS         $0.56         $0.35       63.0%     Adjusted EBITDA*         $9.7         $8.5       13.3%       * Reconciliation table at end of release      Balance Sheet Highlights (USD in Millions)                3/31/2016                    12/31/2015             Percentage Change                           Cash and Cash Equivalents   $70.9         $60.9       16.4%     Total Current Assets   $127.2         $119.8       6.2%     Total Assets   $173.3         $167.0       3.7%      Working Capital    $78.0         $73.4       6.3%     Total Liabilities   $49.2         $46.4       6.0%     Shareholders' Equity   $124.1         $120.6       2.9%     Total Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity   $173.3         $167.0       3.7%      Financial Review   Total sales for three months ended March 31, 2016 increased to $39.6 million from $37.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase was due to the Company's focused on soliciting new orders from existing and new customers along with increased local sales in China.   The Company's gross profit increased by 23.3% to $11.7 million during the period ended March 31, 2016, with gross margin improving to 29.5% from 25.3% for the prior prior-year period. The increase in gross profit and margin was due to the continued progression of the Company towards targeting new product orders, which typically generate a greater margin.   Income from operations was $7.1 million, or 17.8% of revenues, during the period ended March 31, 2016, compared to $5.3 million, or 14.2% of revenues, in the prior-year period. The improved operating margin was largely due to the higher new product orders cited above, along with decreased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues.   Similarly, net income for the period ended March 31, 2016 was $7.2 million or $0.56 per share based on approximately 12.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to $4.5 million or $0.35 per share based on approximately 12.9 million weighted average diluted shares, in the prior-year period.    Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $9.7 million, compared to $8.5 million in the prior-year period.

Plastec Technologies Reports Fiscal 2015 Financial Results; Announces Final 2015 Cash Dividend Of $0.20 Per Share






Business Wire




Mar 22, 2016 9:00 AM EDT













 


















































  Closing is expected in 2016 and is contingent on certain closing conditions including SYB's receipt of external financing.   Management Comments  Mr. Kin Sun Sze-To, Chairman of Plastec, stated, "In 2015, we achieved incremental margin expansion in light of a challenging macro environment in the consumer products sector and maintained strong cash flows throughout the year. We were pleased that Plastec increased margins throughout our market segments by capturing more first-run product lines from our long-term customers. The Company successfully improved effective capacity in both its China and Thailand facilities while maintaining a low-cost infrastructure. We believe that our strong financial condition has and will continue to benefit the Company, as many of our lesser capitalized competitors were not able to consistently upgrade their facilities at a regular pace. Plastec continued to utilize its cash flow to reinvest in our business throughout 2015, and we feel this has the Company positioned well in the coming year."  Chairman Sze-To continued, "We were pleased to announce a final cash dividend for fiscal 2015, which is a continuation of our capital management strategy. During 2015, we returned $15.5 million in distributions to shareholders as a reward for their support in light of another strong year of cash generation at Plastec. We also continue to progress on the sale of our plastic injection molding business to SYB. We were pleased to have reached a favorable valuation for the business. We expect the transaction process to continue throughout 2016 and will keep investors apprised of its progress."

The increase was largely due to Plastec attracting new customers, as well as increased production from existing clientele.   For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's gross profit was $42.6 million, or 25.6% of revenues, compared to $38.8 million, or 25.0% of revenues, in the prior-year. The Company's slightly higher gross margin was largely due to a product mix that included new product orders, which typically generate a greater margin, and cost containment.   Income from operations was $20.7 million, or 12.5% of revenues, for fiscal year 2015, compared to $24.5 million, or 15.9% of revenues, in the prior-year. The Company generated lower income from operations and operating margin as compared to the prior year, mainly because of the inclusion of a one-off gain on disposal of a subsidiary in the prior year.   Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $32.4 million, compared to $33.1 million in the prior-year.   For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, net income was $16.8 million, or $1.30 per share based on approximately 12.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to $21.5 million, or $1.67 per share based on approximately 12.9 million weighted average diluted shares, in the prior-year.    Update on Securities Repurchase Plan  The Company has a repurchase plan in place, expanded and extended through September 25, 2016, allowing it to purchase up to $5 million of its securities in both open market and privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of the Company's management and as market conditions allow; which repurchase plan may be suspended, modified or discontinued without any notice at any time. As of the date of this press release, the Company had repurchased 586,010 ordinary shares, 547,600 warrants and no units under the current plan.

Closing is expected in 2016 and is contingent on certain closing conditions including SYB’s receipt of external financing.
Management Comments
Mr. Kin Sun Sze-To, Chairman of Plastec, stated, “The first quarter was a strong start to 2016, as Plastec achieved higher sales, significant improvements in gross margin as a result of capturing more first-run product lines, and continued progression in maintaining costs that allowed our Company to achieve a 61.3% increase in net income in comparison with same quarter in the prior year. We are benefitting from the investments made into our operations over the past few years, which has increased our capabilities to adjust robustly to the needs of our long-term clients. We generated $10.8 million in cash from operations during the period, which is the highest quarterly total since the Company became public, and expect to continue reinvesting in our facilities in the years ahead.”

Financial Review
Total sales for three months ended March 31, 2016 increased to $39.6 million from $37.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase was due to the Company’s focused on soliciting new orders from existing and new customers along with increased local sales in China.
The Company’s gross profit increased by 23.3% to $11.7 million during the period ended March 31, 2016, with gross margin improving to 29.5% from 25.3% for the prior prior-year period. The increase in gross profit and margin was due to the continued progression of the Company towards targeting new product orders, which typically generate a greater margin.
Income from operations was $7.1 million, or 17.8% of revenues, during the period ended March 31, 2016, compared to $5.3 million, or 14.2% of revenues, in the prior-year period. The improved operating margin was largely due to the higher new product orders cited above, along with decreased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues.
Similarly, net income for the period ended March 31, 2016 was $7.2 million or $0.56 per share based on approximately 12.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to $4.5 million or $0.35 per share based on approximately 12.9 million weighted average diluted shares, in the prior-year period.
Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $9.7 million, compared to $8.5 million in the prior-year period.
