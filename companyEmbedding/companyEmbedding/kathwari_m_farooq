Farooq Kathwari was speaker at radical Islamist ISNA conference in 2004
May 7, 2005




MIM: The fact that Farooq Kathwari, the multi millionaire owner of the Ethan Allen furniture company , son Irfan (aka Imran), was killed fighting Jihad against the Russians in Afghanistan should serve as another cautionary tale that every Muslim is suceptible to radical Islam.
Farooq Kathwari recently spoke at a radical Islamist events in the US and his enormous wealth has no doubt made him a donor and guest to be courted by these groups.
Farooq Kathwari came from a priviledged Kashmiri family , attended New York University, worked on Wall Street, and made a fortune as a businessman. That his 19 year old son Imran would leave America to be killed fighting as a Muhajadeen in Afghanistan, shows that even a Muslim from a modern, 'Westernised' background can become a Jihadi and begs the question of how many more Imran Kathwari's may be tempted to become Jihadis).
(The recent trials and convictions of wealthy and educated American born Phd Ali Al Tamimi, (who earned a 3 figure salary working for the US Department of Transport) and was jailed for Jihad recruitment, and Abu Ali, (whose father works for the Saudi Embassy) was accused of training with Al Qaeda and plotting to kill president Bush shows that Farooq Kathwari was an early manifestation of an alarming trend.)
In his blog "Are Muslim Americans victimised?" named Farooq Kathwari as one of the the most sucessful Muslim businessmen in America.
"...Business tycoons of note in the Muslim-American community include Bijan (high-end men's clothing), Rashid A. Chaudhry (personal care products), Ayhan Hakimoglu (armaments), Yusef Haroon (consulting and managerial services), Mansoor Ijaz (investment management), Farooq Kathwari (furniture), Nemir Kirdar (venture capital), and Safi Qureshey (computers). The wealthiest Muslim American appears to be a software engineer of Turkish origins, Kenan Sahin, who in 1999 netted $1.45 billion when he sold his company, Kenan Systems, to Lucent Technologies. Muslim Americans proudly say that theirs is "the richest Muslim society on earth," and they are right. .."http://www.danielpipes.org/article/358
MIM: Besides making the list the richest Muslims in America Farooq Kathwari was also a featured speaker at the Islamic Society of North America 2004 conference which included some of the most radical Islamist leaders and groups in America. ISNA is one of the largest Wahhabist/Saudi funded umbrella groups which owns most of the mosques in America. The ISNA voter recruitment efforts are directed at consolidating Muslim political power in America to further the Islamist objective of turning the United States of America into a 'United States of Allah'.
"...The speakers included Muhammad Nur Abdullah, Dawud Warnsby, Farooq Kathwari, Zaid Shakir, Altaf Husain, Nada Unus, Shazia Siddiqi, Amir Al-Islam, Abdul Hakim Murad (T.J. Winters), Umar Faruq Abd-Allah, Mokhtar Maghraoui, Shugufta Yasmeen, Habibe Husain,Rami Nashishibi, Thomas Simons Jr., Ingrid Mattson, Hamza Yusuf, Suhaib Webb, Abdalla Idris Ali, Abdul Rashied Omar, Feisal M. Abdur Rauf, Ekram Beshir, Suhaib Webb, Kenya Numan, Ihsan Bagby, Suhail Ghannouchi, Hadia Mubarak, Salam Al-Maryati, Omar Ahmad and Agha Saeed.
Moderator were Azhar Azeez, Louay Safi, Ingrid Mattson, Syed Imtiaz Ahmad, Kamran Memon and Kareem Irfan.
Ten top Muslim American organizations Sunday evening set up 'The American Muslim Taskforce (AMT)', but declined to make an endorsement for a single candidate in the U.S. presidential elections, appealing to the community to unite, register to vote, and fully participate in the November polls.
The ten organizations are: AMA, CAIR, ICNA, ISNA, MENA, MAS, MPAC, MSA National, Islamic Hope and UMA. The previous task force of the Muslim Americans had endorsed George Bush in the 2000 elections, which decision was, however, opposed by the African-Americans, who vote for Democrats. http://www.pakistantimes.net/2004/09/08/specialreport.htm
---------------------------------------
MIM: Farooq Kathwari's brother wrote an entire article about Irfan Kathari's death in Jihad entitled: "My Nephew the Freedom Fighter". The article gives a valuable insight into how wealthy American born Muslims can get involved in Jihad, (the juxtaposition of a long haired Irfan Kathwari shooting hoops in driveway of the family farm where his father's BMW is parked and listening to Metallica, to his last picture in traditional Muslim garb in Afghanistan and a note reaffirming his'love for Allah". Kathawari's father was also a high ranking official in Kashmir, which shows that the family, many of whom still live there, and continue their involvement in the political life of the region. The writer of the article Rafiq Kathwari, has said that after 35 years, he still feels as the same about the struggle in Kashmir.
http://www.featurewell.com/?Doc=Signin.cfm&AID=2080










MY NEPHEW, THE FREEDOM FIGHTER by Rafiq Kathwari , 1313 words All rights available. Essays: The author, an American born in Kashmir, remembers his cousin, who is "buried in a mass grave somewhere in the minefields of Afghanistan." Full story...
"...My family has a longstanding tradition of activism in Kashmir. My father was once a Finance Minister in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. We had migrated there in 1949 after India and Pakistan fought their first war over Kashmir. My mother wrote letters to world leaders pleading with them not to forget the plight of broken families separated by an artificial cease fire line, which in Kashmir is called the Line of Control. We returned to Indian-occupied Kashmir in 1960, after 11 years. There, Irfan's father and I were jailed for several months by Indian authorities for our student activism. That was the family tradition that influenced my nephew Irfan...""... Freedom for Kashmir was near, or so it seemed. 

Those events impacted Irfan differently then they did me or my brother. Irfan spent his waking hours that summer at the local mosque, sometimes returning home late at night...
Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, and a few months later when smart bombs fell in Baghdad, Irfan wanted to enroll at King Faisal U in Islamabad..."
 
A few weeks later, Irfan wrote that he and a handful of his new classmates had crossed the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in a Toyota pick up several times without being stopped. A photo shows him wearing the long shirt, the kameez, and loose pants, the shalwar; he is stroking his curly beard. There is no Kalashnikov on his shoulder. "Love of Allah," he wrote in another letter, "is the only love I have ever known." 
 
On one such trip, Allah's foot soldier seemingly cast the first stone. The enemy released an arc across the sky. In their backyard in America, his mom was pruning roses under a gunmetal sky, the day the call came. 
My nephew is buried in a mass grave in the desolation of Afghanistan. My brother and sister-in- law, who believe that their son was killed in a freak accident fighting the Soviets, are, of course, entitled to find solace in any idea that helps them come to terms with their sorrow..." 

MIM:The interviewer refers to Imran Kathwari's death while fighting Jihad in Chechyna as his having been the youthful pursuit of a 'romantic notion' and glosses over the death without questioning what could have motivated the son of one of America's wealthiest business tycoons, from an 'assimilated' Muslim background, to become a Muhajideen fighter in Afghanistan.

2001 Business Week
At Ethan Allen, Selling Furniture and Tolerance



CEO Farooq Kathwari has revitalized the company, while leading a campaign to bring peace to Kashmir
http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_43/b3754076.htmGrief, comfort, gratitude, patriotism. That was the language of most chief executives' messages in newspapers around the country after the violence of Sept. 11. But M. Farooq Kathwari, the head of furniture retailer Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. (ETH ), a Muslim who left Kashmir some 35 years ago and now an American citizen trying to bring peace to that troubled place, wrote of something else. Deep sadness, yes. But also of the need to "foster unity among people of different faiths." As community leaders have stated in the days since the Twin Towers fell, Kathwari says: "The terrorists win if the search for justice turns to vengeance."Kathwari, 57, knows something of how grief and anger work on people. His eldest son was killed in Afghanistan in 1992: Imran, a 19-year-old college student born and raised in America, was drawn there by romantic notions of the fight against the Russians (and by that time, the regime they backed), says Kathwari. Imran went despite the family's opposition. He died in a mortar attack, in one of the last battles for the capital, Kabul. "My son is lying in rubble in Afghanistan," Kathwari says.A death like that could make a parent bitter for life. And Kathwari was for a while. But eventually he decided to get involved, not in Afghanistan but in Kashmir, as a diplomat of sorts. At least 35,000 Kashmiris have died or disappeared since 1989, when their renewed call for more autonomy, if not independence, from India, sparked a rebellion that Pakistan supports. Kathwari, once a student activist in Kashmir, brought together a group of predominantly American politicians, academics, and former diplomats in 1996 to suggest ways to end the civil strife. Kathwari, talking publicly about his work there for the first time, says: "I wanted to try to save parents from the agony of losing a child. And Kashmir helps me maintain perspective."What makes Kathwari's experience so interesting is the way in which it has influenced his leadership at Ethan Allen, that most traditional of American retail icons. He's as demanding as any CEO. But colleagues also talk about his sense of justice and humility. As Sandra Lamenza, vice-president and general manager of the retail division, puts it: "Ego is not tolerated. You can't throw power around."Kathwari, who grew up in a privileged, politically active family, left Kashmir in 1965 to obtain an MBA at New York University. After a few years on Wall Street, he began importing handicrafts from Kashmir. In 1980, Kathwari sold his company to Ethan Allen, an early client, and five years later he was promoted to president.Since then he has changed almost everything about Ethan Allen: the furniture, the design of its 300-plus stores, its relationship with dealers, and the senior management, almost all of whom retired between 1988 and 1990. Ethan Allen used to sell traditional furniture, some of which hadn't been updated in 40 years, in stores that even employees say looked like colonial museums. "Ethan Allen was a trusted, dusty brand in danger of going the way of the Oldsmobile," says Simon Williams, chairman of brand consultant Sterling Group in New York. Kathwari and his designers made over its Valley Forge look to suit modern tastes and they now launch new collections more frequently. They have also remodeled most stores and relocated half to prime retail space.At the same time, Kathwari took on the independent dealers who sold most of Ethan Allen's furniture. Breaking with industry protocol, he told them to sell only the company's merchandise at one price to be set in the Danbury (Conn.) headquarters. He also required them all to buy the furniture at the same price; before, the bigger dealers received a discount. Several of them confronted Kathwari in 1986, saying: "Do you think you are Robin Hood? You're giving to smaller dealers at [our] expense." To Kathwari it was an issue of fairness, and that was that. Two dealers walked out.A MESSAGE. Now the transformation is almost complete. To fend off a hostile bid in 1989, Kathwari led a $350 million buyout; that gave him a 10% stake in the company and more operational control. Kathwari took Ethan Allen public again in 1993. At most stores, sales have tripled since 1985, and the company's profit margins are the highest of any furniture manufacturer. But of course, no business is immune to the slowing economy and the likelihood of protracted military action. Profits for the fiscal year that ended on June 30 were $84 million, down 7% from a year ago. Sales were $904 million, up 5.6%. As late as June the stock price was holding up well, at about $38. Now it's trading around $30. To reduce costs, Kathwari closed three U.S. factories this year and he is moving some production to Southeast Asia. He still expects sales to grow 5% in 2001. Though that may be optimistic these days, the company does have a strong enough balance sheet to weather a recession.Kathwari talks often about establishing "a moral precedent" at Ethan Allen. When Corey Whitely, vice-president of retail operations, won the company's Golden Kite achievement award in 2000, Kathwari said he should think of it as recognition that he fulfilled his responsibilities with modesty. And when the company bought a plant in Virginia ten months ago, he told Charlie Farfaglia, vice-president of human resources, to recognize the employees' service with the old company when determining benefits. Kathwari also speaks of religious tolerance, when speaking of it seems appropriate. At a Christmas dinner he hosted, he read from the Koran about the birth of Jesus. After Sept. 11, the staff agreed Ethan Allen should put a public message in a few newspapers. "They know of my loss. They know I believe injustice is a sin," he says. Kathwari wrote the note himself.Kathwari is intimately involved, some would say overly, in running the company. That doesn't work to everyone's benefit. After years of operating without a chief financial officer--the company has a controller--Kathwari decided last year to hire William Beisswanger from Ernst & Young LLP. He left after nine months. Beisswanger would only say that "Farooq is very hands-on. I didn't think it was the right place for me." Kathwari has since hired someone else.Any difficulties with the turnaround pale alongside Kathwari's efforts to bring peace to Kashmir. The Kashmir Study Group is an independent effort, initially welcomed by no one and still criticized by some as out of touch. But over the past five years, Kathwari has largely persuaded Indian and Pakistani officials that he is serious, fair, and worth their time. "He and his project are highly respected by both sides as well as the U.S. government," says a Bush Administration official.The group's report, released in early 2000, offers a supple approach to sovereignty, giving Kashmiris (a majority of whom are Muslim) the right to rule themselves within India or Pakistan. That is a controversial notion among Indians who want to retain control, and some of them view Kathwari with suspicion. "They've asked the leaders to imagine a settlement that's fair to both. It's very helpful just to get people thinking about that," says Frank C. Wisner, a former ambassador to India who is now a director at Ethan Allen. Last year Kathwari met with Pakistan's ruler, President Pervez Musharraf, and Indian officials close to Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee; he was one of many urging them to talk. The two met in the Indian city of Agra in July and are considering another summit. The violence continues: A car bomb exploded near the state legislature Oct. 1, killing at least 40 people. Now, though, there may be more pressure to bring peace to Kashmir, says Kathwari, because then "those fighting jihad there would lose an important base."Kathwari insists that his work in Kashmir didn't distract him from Ethan Allen, and the board doesn't seem worried. "It helps give him a sense of value beyond the furniture business," says Edward H. Meyer, a director and head of Grey Global Group Inc., an advertising agency in New York. Who can argue with that? 



Corrections and ClarificationsIn "Selling Furniture and Tolerance" (People, Oct. 22) about Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. CEO M. Farooq Kathwari, the name of Kathwari's late son should have been Irfan. BusinessWeek apologizes for the error

MIM:This entry on Google groups reveals that Kathwari is known as a "sucessionist leader' based in America and that he used the Ethan Allen company as a front to meet with a Kashmiri official to discuss what was said to be timber for furniture manufacture. As the writer of the artcle points out - the region in question is does not permit use of forests for timber and the meeting was for political reasons. In a discussion of an article entitled "Letter from a Shaheed" comments were posted which stated that it was Farooq Kathwari who motivated his son to quit his medical studies at Harvard to wage Jihad in Afghanistan where he was killed in 1992. (see entry below)
What would be interesting would be to hold a refrendum in Jammu , Ladakh and the valley and ask each voter which state they would like to live in , if these states were carved out of the present Kashmir . Its almost certain that most of the Muslims of Doda and even the valley would vote to join Jammu , to stay in India proper and this would be a kind of indirect refrendum .. A divisive agenda 
Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah's recent conclave with United States-based secessionist leader Farooq Kathwari is seen as part of a larger U.S.-sponsored covert dialogue on Jammu and Kashmir, in which the Vajpayee Government is complicit. 
PRAVEEN SWAMI 
JOIN the dots on the graph charting the future of Jammu and Kashmir, and it is hard to miss the shape staring back from the page. On March 8, Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah and a group of his top Cabinet colleagues held a closed-door secret meeting with Farooq Kathwari, a U.S.-based secessionist leader. The meeting, held at the Secretariat in Jammu, appears to be just part of a larger U.S.-sponsored covert dialogue on Jammu and Kashmir. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the Bharatiya Janata Party-l ed coalition government in New Delhi is complicit in this dialogue, which could lead to a violent communal sundering of the State. 
Kathwari heads the Kashmir Study Group (KSG), an influential New York-based think tank which has been advocating the creation of an independent state carved out of the Muslim-majority areas of Jammu and Kashmir. The owner of Ethan Allen, an upmarket furn iture concern which includes the White House among its clients, Kathwari's associates in the KSG have included influential Indian establishment figures, notably former Foreign Secretary S.K. Singh and retired Vice-Admiral N.K. Nair. Kathwari was blacklis ted by successive Indian governments and on one occasion was even denied permission to visit the country to meet a seriously ill relative. Shortly after the BJP-led coalition took power in 1998, however, he was granted a visa. 
It is still unclear at whose initiative the visa was granted. But Kathwari arrived in New Delhi in March 1999, carrying a series of proposals for the creation of an independent Kashmiri state. Called Kashmir: A Way Forward, the proposals were the outcome of the KSG's deliberations. On this first visit, he met what one senior intelligence official describes as a "who's who of the BJP establishment". Kathwari also appears to have visited Jammu and Srinagar, staying at the home of a top National Con ference politician. Frontline has so far been unable to establish whether he met Abdullah on that occasion. 
Public disclosure of Kathwari's proposals provoked a minor storm. Both S.K. Singh and N.K. Nair disassociated themselves from its recommendations. Nonetheless, Kathwari seemed encouraged enough to push ahead with a new version of Kashmir: A Way Forwar d. Last September, a fresh version of the document was finalised after, its preface records, receiving reactions from "government officials in India and Pakistan". The new document was even more disturbing than the first. At least one KSG member, the University of South Carolina's Robert Wirsing, refused even to participate in the discussions. But the BJP, it now appears, was not wholly unhappy with the direction Kathwari was proceeding in. 
Kashmir: A Way Forward outlines five proposals for the creation of either one or two new states, which would together constitute what is described in somewhat opaque fashion as a "sovereign entity but one without an international personality". "Th e new entity," the KSG report says, "would have its own secular, democratic constitution, as well as its own citizenship, flag and a legislature which would legislate on all matters other than defence and foreign affairs... India and Pakistan would be re sponsible for the defence of the Kashmiri entity, which would itself maintain police and gendarme forces for internal law and order purposes. India and Pakistan would be expected to work out financial arrangements for the Kashmiri entity, which could inc lude a currency of its own." 
Four of five possible Kashmiri entities the KSG discusses involve two separate states on either side of the Line of Control (LoC), and territorial exchanges between India and Pakistan. But the fifth Kashmiri entity outlined in Kashmir: A Way Forward - of a single state on the Indian side of the LoC - is the most interesting of the KSG proposals. Premised on the assumption that Pakistan would be unwilling to allow the creation of a new entity on its side of the LoC - although there is no discussio n of what will happen if India were to be similarly disinclined - the new state would come into being after a series of tehsil-level referendums. All the districts of the Kashmir Valley, the districts of Kargil and Doda, three northern tehsils of Rajouri and one tehsil of Udhampur, the KSG believes, would opt to join the new Kashmiri state. 
Kashmir: A Way Forward attempts, somewhat desperately, to prove that its assumptions are not based on communal grounds. "All these areas," it argues, "are imbued with Kashmiriyat, the cultural traditions of the Vale of Kashmir, and/or interact ext ensively with Kashmiri-speaking people." But this assumption is patently spurious, for several of these areas also interact similarly with peoples who do not speak Kashmiri. There is no explanation, for example, as to why the linguistic, cultural and tra de links between the three northern Muslim-majority tehsils of Rajouri district and the three southern Hindu-majority tehsils are of any less significance than those they have with the Kashmir region. 
Nor is it made clear what linguistic affiliation the tehsils of Karnah and Uri in Kashmir, where just 3.2 per cent and 3.1 per cent of the population were recorded as Kashmiri-speakers in the 1981 Census, the last carried out in Jammu and Kashmir, might have with the Valley. Indeed, these tehsils have recorded some of the highest voter turnouts in successive elections from 1996, suggesting that their residents have little sympathy for Kashmir Valley-centred secessionist politics. Similarly, while Ramban and Bhaderwah tehsils in Doda are not Kashmiri-speaking and principally trade with Jammu, the KSG proposals make the a priori assumption that they would vote to join the new state. 
OFFICIALS in Jammu and Kashmir seemed uncertain of just what Kathwari and Abdullah discussed during their meeting. State Chief Secretary Ashok Jaitley told Frontline that the meeting had indeed been held, but said that he was unaware of just what was discussed. "What I can tell you is that the initiative for the meeting was not ours," he said, "and that the highest quarters were consulted before it was held." Others said Kathwari had requested the meeting to discuss a potential timber business in the State. Neither the Jammu and Kashmir Directorate of Public Relations, which handles media interaction with the Chief Minister, nor Abdullah's personal staff, responded to queries from Frontline. 
Even leaving aside the minor point that following Supreme Court orders, felling forests is illegal in Jammu and Kashmir it seems implausible that the content of Kathwari's dialogue with Abdullah centred on raw material for Ethan Allen. The National Confe rence's proposals for Jammu and Kashmir's future have striking similarities with those that the KSG is touting. The controversial report of the Regional Autonomy Committee (RAC), which was tabled in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly last year (Frontline , July 30, 1999) and is in the process of being implemented, bears similarities with the KSG proposals. Muslim-majority Rajouri and Poonch are scheduled to be cut away from the Jammu region and recast as a new Pir Panjal province. The single districts of Buddhist-majority Leh and Muslim-majority Kargil too will be sundered from each other and become new provinces. 
In some cases, the RAC Report and the KSG proposals mirror each other down to the smallest detail. For example, Kashmir: A Way Forward refers to the inclusion of a Gool-Gulabgarh tehsil in the new state. There is, in fact, no such tehsil. Gool and Gulabgarh were parts of the tehsil of Mahore, the sole Muslim-majority tehsil of Udhampur district, until 1999. Gool subsequently became a separate tehsil. But the proposal for Mahore's sundering from Udhampur and inclusion in the Chenab province was fi rst made in the RAC Report. According to the RAC plan, as in the KSG proposals, Mahore would form part of the Chenab province, while Udhampur would be incorporated in the Hindu-majority Jammu province. 
Significantly, Abdullah's plans for the future of Jammu and Kashmir's relationship with India match the KSG's formulation of a quasi-sovereign state. The report of the State Autonomy Committee (SAC), which was released in March 1999 and is now under cons ideration by the Centre, would leave New Delhi with no powers other than the management of defence, external affairs and communications. Fundamental rights mentioned in the Constitution, for example, would no longer apply to Jammu and Kashmir if the SAC has its way. They will have to be substituted by a separate chapter on fundamental rights in the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution, which now contains only Directive Principles. The Supreme Court's jurisdiction over Jammu and Kashmir will end and the State Election Commission will conduct polls in the State, not the Election Commission of India. 
While the National Conference's demands for greater autonomy are in themselves not disturbing, the context in which they have been made and their character are. For one, the SAC proposals were pushed through without debate in the Assembly and a nation-wi de political debate on the issue, promised by Abdullah, never took place. Meaningful autonomy seems to be the last of the SAC's concerns. The report does not contain even one sentence about financial autonomy, essential ...
What would be interesting would be to hold a refrendum in Jammu , Ladakh and the valley and ask each voter which state they would like to live in , if these states were carved out of the present Kashmir . Its almost certain that most of the Muslims of Doda and even the valley would vote to join Jammu , to stay in India proper and this would be a kind of indirect refrendum .. A divisive agenda 
Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah's recent conclave with United States-based secessionist leader Farooq Kathwari is seen as part of a larger U.S.-sponsored covert dialogue on Jammu and Kashmir, in which the Vajpayee Government is complicit.

A meeting that portends a new Kashmir 
JAMMU, March 14 
WITH the US President, Mr. Bill Clinton's visit to India and Pakistan just days away, the dots on the map charting the future of Jammu & Kashmir are starting to join together into a striking picture. 
The Jammu & Kashmir Chief Minister, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, held a one-to-one closed-door meeting with Mr. Farooq Kathwari, a top secessionist political figure, in Jammu last week. He subsequently flew to Srinagar, where he stayed with his father-in-law, Mr. Ghulam Rasool Khan. The March 8 meeting with Mr. Kathwari suggests that the Union Government is engaged in a dialogue on plans that would, in effect, amount to a fresh partition of Jammu & Kashmir, this time on communal lines. 
Mr. Kathwari heads the Kashmir Studies Group (KSG), an influential think-tank which has been advocating the creation of a quasi-independent State carved out of the Muslim-majority areas of Jammu & Kashmir. The owner of Ethan Allen, an upmarket furniture concern which includes the White House among its clients, Mr. Kathwari's associates in the KSG include the former Foreign Secretary, Mr. N.K. Singh, and Vice-Admiral S.K. Nair (retd.). Although the furniture tycoon had been blacklisted by successive Indian governments, he received a visa last year and visited several senior establishment figures. 
A KSG report circulated among top Indian and Pakistani officials subsequently detailed proposals for the creation of a new "sovereign entity but one without an international personality." "The new entity," the report said, "would have its own secular, democratic constitution, as well as its own citizenship, flag and a legislature which would legislate on all matters other than defence and foreign affairs." 
The most significant of five proposals Kashmir: A Way Forward envisages is a single Kashmiri State on the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC). It argues for a series of tehsil-level referendums leading to all of the Kashmir Valley's districts, along with the district of Doda, opting to be part of the new entity. The KSG's new entity would also include the district of Kargil, three northern tehsils from Rajouri, and a single tehsil of Udhampur. The new State would, in effect, be an agglomeration of the Muslim-majority tehsils of Jammu & Kashmir. 
No one in Jammu seemed to be aware of just what Dr. Abdullah discussed with Mr. Kathwari during their hour-long interaction. The Chief Secretary, Mr. Ashok Jaitley, told Business Line that the meeting had indeed been held, but said that he was unaware of just what had been discussed. "What I can tell you is that the initiative for the meeting was not ours," he said, "and that the highest quarters were consulted before it was held." Neither the Jammu & Kashmir Directorate of Public Relations, which handles media interaction with the Chief Minister, nor Dr. Abdullah's personal staff responded to queries. 
While officials contacted in New Delhi argued that the Kathwari-Abdullah meeting had no significance, the facts appear to suggest otherwise. The KSG's specific suggestions for the powers of the new entity are remarkably similar to those proposed by Jammu & Kashmir's State Autonomy Commission (SAC). The SAC's report, now under consideration by the Union Government, would restore the State's 1953 constitutional status, giving it power over all subjects barring defence and external affairs. Significantly, no major Union Government figure has taken issue with the proposals. 
The communal ripping apart of Jammu & Kashmir suggested in the KSG report has also found expression in the controversial recommendations of the Jammu & Kashmir Regional Autonomy Commission (RAC). The RAC proposes to create a series of communally-homogeneous provinces, mirroring the KSG report's cartographic content down to the last tehsil. More than a few observers believe that the dialogue now in progress could lead to an internal partition of Jammu & Kashmir, with the Muslim-majority provinces gaining quasi-independence, and the Hindu-majority regions being further integrated in India. 
Interestingly, the Pakistani journalist, Mr. Talat Hussain, reported last year in The Nation that the back-channel negotiators during the Kargil war, Mr. Niaz Naik and Mr. R.K. Mishra, had discussed what was described as the "Chenab Plan" for Kashmir. The Chenab Plan which, according to Mr. Hussain's report, was documented in a Pakistani proposal, an Indian response, and a second Pakistani proposal, suggested recognition of the LoC as the border, followed by the grant of autonomy to Kashmir Valley. Several US establishment figures, too, have argued that India needs to make concessions in this direction. 
The secrecy shrouding such dialogue has fuelled fears that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union Government is engaged in an exercise that could have serious repercussions. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) MLA, Mr. M.Y. Tarigami, told Business Line that the senior BJP leader, Mr. K.R. Malkani, had, at a conference last month, told him that a division of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh was, in the long term, inevitable.

Poem 1
ISRAELI PATROLS KILL
90 DOGS IN ARAB TOWN
The New York Times, April 14, 1995
Mother, I'm living in sin with an Egyptian
Jew raised in Paris. We stroll in Central Park.
Gaulois, her mutt, off the leash. Lucky he's
not in Hebron, where gods kill dogs for sport.
Poem 2
HISTORY'S MOST PERSECUTED MINORITY
IS INSENSITIVE TO THE ASPIRATIONS
OF WORLD'S MOST DISPOSSESSED TRIBE
I held my sister-in-law's hand
in the back seat of the Volkswagen
while my older brother drove
through red lights to Maimonides.
"Kicking," she said, drawing my hand
over her belly. I lowered my gaze: Her
toes curled on the car floor.
He was born a Scorpio.
For years I watched my nephew
dunk hoops, grow his hair long, flunk
Islam and embrace the NRA,
his dad's rifle on boy's shoulder.
"On Judgment Day," he wrote
"We shall meet again."
Allah's soldier flung a stone
somewhere in Afghanistan
the enemy fired arcs across
a cobalt sky. In their Brooklyn yard
his mom was pruning roses
the day the call came.
Poem 3
ASSIGNMENT
Only Muslim in the workshop,
I went on about the President,
his firm stand on Iraq,
civilization's cradle, bombed
back to the Stone Age for flaunting
weapons sold by capitalist gunrunners.
I am a witness, I must howl, I said.
In every well in Baghdad a Rafiq
is weeping while long black coats (with
gas masks) huddle at the Wailing Wall,
as if prayers could halt smart bombs.
"Rhetoric, not lyric," my peers echoed Yeats.
"Argue with yourself, not others." The teacher,
an adjunct, said "Presidential warhead
rising from its silo was over the top. Nike
stockpiling kneepads, sick. Not ars poetica."

Kashmir Dispute Will Make Ground Zero Seem Like a Bonfire
By Rafiq Kathwari
When I was a teenager about 35 years ago and in my final year in college in Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir, the movie "Battle for Algiers" was a big hit. It captured my imagination as well as that of my classmates, one of whom approached me a few days later and asked if I would commit myself to the liberation of Kashmir. Yes, of course, I said, reading a typed sheet my friend took out from his coat pocket. "Bear Arms against a Sea of Troubles," I remember the title said.
"This is our manifesto," my friend said as I read the aims and objectives, which included blowing up bridges and the local radio and telephone buildings, ambushing army convoys and killing soldiers. The text said nothing about where we would get arms and ammunition, the number of members in the group, how we would organize, who our leader was or when we would execute our plan.
However, I remember the manifesto was long on the why, with each point emphasized in the present tense: Our cause is freedom. India promised us a referendum on our future, but fails to keep its promise. Prime Minster Nehru, the last Englishman to rule India, has kept our popular leader Sheikh Abdullah in jail for over 15 years. To the extent that India denies us our fundamental rights and subverts its own constitution, to that extent, India is not a democracy.
It was great stuff for my impressionable mind. My friend had energized me. If the Algerians could do it, so could Kashmiris. I read the typed manifesto again before signing it with a flourish.
A few weeks later that teenage flirtation landed me for 11 months in Srinagar's Central Jail, where I met 12 of my classmates who had also signed the manifesto. (The college Principal had been somehow alerted to the plan and called the police.) Subsequently, India announced that it had cracked a dangerous gang of terrorists trained in Pakistan. There was no trial. We were just locked up and forgotten, until one beneficent pro-India sycophant in Kashmir was replaced by another, who ordered an amnesty. Soon after, I fled to the future of other continents.
The passage of 35 years hasn't dimmed my memory. My passion for Kashmir's freedom is undiminished, despite the horror of the last ten years during which anywhere from 35,000 to 80,000 mostly civilians have been killed. Maddened by merciless Hinduization of Kashmir's Muslim culture, the lack of career opportunities and India's repeated betrayals during the past 50 years, a rag tag army of young Kashmiri men took on the third largest army in the world.
To obtains arms, those young men crossed the Line of Control that divides Indian from Pakistani- administered Kashmir, rode in buses to Kabul, where armaments supplied by the CIA to the Mujahideen were readily available after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan. India calls those Kashmiri youth "cross border terrorists" and blames Pakistan for supporting them. Pakistan, which has competing claims on Kashmir, calls them freedom fighters. Many Kashmiris I know simply say, a plague on all your houses, which, of course, includes my adopted home-I know it's politically incorrect to say it- the United States.
Many young native Kashmiri men who took up arms against a sea of troubles are dead or languishing in India's jails. The fighting now is being mostly done by foreign mercenaries, recruited by the elusive Mr. bin Laden, whose so-called martyrs have changed the tenor of Kashmir's legitimate struggle to that of an Islamic Jihad against Hindu India.
"See, we told you so," India is screaming, "Kashmiris are terrorists." India has fueled Western fears of resurgent Islam, propagandizing the militancy as fundamentalist, which in turn enables India to flout all international codes of conduct in Kashmir. If all Kashmiris are terrorists and must be smoked out of the Himalayas by 500,000 Indian troops stationed there, then let us at the very least agree on a working definition of terrorism which must include both the unofficial and official variety.
But, wait. Let's be honest. Prior to the militancy, India portrayed Kashmir as the model for secularism in India, as the warp of her pluralist democracy. What has propelled Kashmiri society seemingly overnight from a model of secularism to deranged fanaticism?
Under the present ultra right wing regime, Indian society is becoming increasingly intolerant and absolutist. There is a profound disturbance within Mother India. Many Indians I know think of India as a super power next only to the United States. I will believe that when Kashmir, the source of five great rivers, gets a basic sanitation system and an unrestricted flow of electricity the Kashmir valley itself generates.
Kashmiris have been enslaved for generations. The West is finally taking note of the fact that regional conflicts have a global reach. Nothing is remote anymore. It never was. Now we must do whatever is necessary to win the hearts and minds of alienated peoples such as the Kashmiris. Restore their dignity. Fulfill longstanding promises, and watch how swiftly Kashmiris sign a manifesto to honor democracy in a world that has changed literally overnight after nine eleven zero one. Indifference will make Ground Zero seem like a Boy Scout's bonfire gone awry.

Personal life[edit]
Kathwari is of Kashmiri descent, hailing from Srinagar.[5] His father went to Lahore, Pakistan, in 1949 for a short business trip and found himself stranded as the authorities in Srinagar cancelled his return permit. He settled in Pakistan and assumed an official role in the Azad Kashmir government. In 1950, Farooq along with his mother and siblings moved to Pakistan to join his father. The family lived in Pakistan for 10 years.[6] They returned to Kashmir in 1960, whence Kathwari spent a few years in college and participated as an activist in the Kashmiri political movement. He was to return to Pakistan again in 1965, a week before the Indo-Pakistani war broke out. There, he obtained his travel documents to finally migrate to the United States.[6]

In a Former Life: M. Farooq Kathwari









 By Ilan Mochari


Ilan Mochari's debut novel, Zinsky the Obscure (Fomite Press, 2013), earned rave reviews from Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, and Booklist. Boston's NPR station named it one of 10 "Good Reads for the Summer." He is a senior writer for Inc. magazine.

Present life: CEO of Ethan Allen, a $679-million manufacturer and retailer of furniture, with 316 stores and 21 plants, headquartered in Danbury, Conn.
Former life: Political activist. In Kashmir, where Kathwari grew up, "students were beaten, arrested; police would use their sticks," he says. In the early 1960s, Kathwari regularly led protests and marches for Kashmiri self-rule. Times were riotous then: the ruling Indian government had kept Kashmiri leader Sheikh Abdullah in jail since 1953. Also, India was blamed when a holy relic of the Prophet Mohammed was missing from the Hazratbal shrine in Srinagar. On a plane, Kathwari met an American journalist who was in Kashmir to cover the relic's disappearance. After taking the journalist around to demonstrations, Kathwari got into trouble with the Kashmiri government. In 1965 he came to America and requested political asylum.
Lessons learned: "If your nation's been fighting for self-governance since 1586, you realize that to change things sometimes takes a long time."
That helped Kathwari cope when he became president of Ethan Allen, in 1985. For seven years prior to Kathwari's arrival there, the company's sales had been mired at about $200 million. "I had to change our whole image. Early American colonial was no longer a style category people wanted. We sold 70% of our line during four months of the year, and we didn't have unified national pricing," says the CEO. "When we started doing 'one cost,' we had to raise prices in the East. There was opposition from the eastern independent retailers, who were used to doing things their way and were worried they'd lose money."
Kathwari convinced the East Coast retailers that their short-term losses would ultimately be worth it when the company became a stronger national presence: "But we needed to do it in stages," Kathwari says. "Trying to do everything at once would have meant failure." Before implementing unified pricing, Kathwari made several incremental changes, all of which were initially resisted by the independents: he banished other brands from Ethan Allen stores, he flew 600 in-store salespeople to Danbury to persuade them that the company's new styles would sell enough to support brand exclusivity, and he switched the company's advertising strategy from more than 100 locally managed ad campaigns to one nationally coordinated push.
Kathwari's patient revolution has paid off, stabilizing the company and preparing it for the next big leap: E-commerce. "We'd have a tough time doing E-commerce, though, if we didn't have one price nationally," he says. "But that's all a major result of work we started years ago."

Profile: M. Farooq Kathwari
Published by The New York Sun on 2005-02-07
Quiet-spoken and quietly self-confident, Farooq Kathwari -- chairman, president and chief executive officer of Ethan Allen Inc. -- is not one to boast about anything, not even about the profitability of his 73-year-old furniture and home furnishings corporation, which has 313 independent and company-operated stores around America and dozens more in 21 locations around the world.  Neither is he likely to suggest satisfaction that, in a $60 billion-a-year industry, scores of his competitors have fallen by the wayside -- especially in the recessionary times of the last three years -- while Ethan Allen has gone from strength to strength. About the only prideful comment coming from Mr. Kathwari is what he said yesterday to The New York Sun: "Ethan Allen is in a better position today than it has ever been." Indeed it is. The company -- whose stock (ETH) is traded on the New York Stock Exchange -- has a market capitalization of $1.4 billion. (Its stock closed at $36.50 yesterday, with trading of 160,200 shares.) Its retail sales of $1.2 billion in 2004 produced pretax profits of $170 million. Ethan Allen gave its shareholders $110 million in extra dividends. The Danbury, Connecticut-based company, which has been averaging annual growth of at least 15% over the last five years, has no debt. And an operating cash flow of at least $100 million annually enables Mr. Kathwari to engage in bold expansion at a time when the rest of the industry is contracting. In the last dozen years, some 20,000 furniture stores have gone out of business in America alone. Mr. Kathwari will allow that "our industry is in a great stage of confusion and transition." That's because new distribution channels and specialty retailing have hurt traditional manufacturers who relied on old-fashioned production and marketing techniques; cheaply produced furniture from the Orient flooded American stores, and many domestic manufacturers simply weren't able to cope with these imports. Many also remained mired in moribund designs, vainly trying to cater to a constituency of consumers that had long moved on to more modernism in their choice of home furnishings. But Mr. Kathwari understood long ago that the furniture business could not remain fastened to tradition. Ethan Allen's colonial designs had remained unchanged since 1932 when its factory in Beecher Falls, Vermont, started mass-producing furniture that sold at $39 a piece. Neither had the trademark facades of its stores -- each having a distinctive colonial spire -- changed in the 50 years preceding his becoming the company's president. Mr. Kathwari set about engendering dramatic changes in Ethan Allen's products as well as the architecture of its stores. The idea was to inject a contemporary sensibility into the company's brand. That meant changing the Ethan Allen look from what Mr. Kathwari characterizes as "a colonial to a classic and contemporary aesthetic." "What customers see as our signature style today is quite different from the way the Ethan Allen brand was seen in years gone by," he said. "You have to be a leader in style and decorating. What does that mean? That means innovation. It means understanding consumer tastes and shaping your products to cater to those tastes. That means being a brand leader." Being a brand leader, in turn, means a relentless emphasis on re-invention, a word that Mr. Kathwari institutionalized at Ethan Allen since he became president 20 years ago. "There are no sacred cows at Ethan Allen," he said. "We are constantly re-assessing, constantly re-examining our products." That work is done by some 3,000 consultants and by 4,000 other company employees at the company's 12 manufacturing plants in America. It is done by associates in various parts of the world with whom Mr. Kathwari continually keeps in touch by e-mail, telephone and through frenetic travel. The re-invention is done, most of all, by Mr. Kathwari himself. He acknowledged yesterday that he possesses "an inborn instinct for opportunity." "When an opportunity for innovation and growth comes along, I seize it," he said. "I am always focused on doing my best. That means hard work, lots of hard work." And so, new stores are opening in China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and other parts of Asia; in Europe; and, of course, all across America. New product lines are being added.  "We have created a brand that's not only known but is preferred," he said. "Our objective is to double our business," Mr. Kathwari told The Sun yesterday after a lunch in his honor at the Asia Society on Park Avenue and 71st Street. Lest that sound excessively ambitious, it should recalled that Farooq Kathwari has succeeded at virtually everything that he's done since his student days in Kashmir in the early '60s. As an English literature and political science major at college in that disputed Himalayan territory that's claimed by both India and Pakistan, he was captain of the cricket team. Indeed, he still talks of those halcyon days and asserts that captaining a cricket team of 11 often disputatious players taught him more about leadership than anything that he subsequently learned while picking up a MBA at New York University, and while working in senior positions at Bear Stearns and Rothschild's. He also talks with fond remembrance of his grandfather, the late Gulam Mohidin, who was a grand old man -- imposing in looks, charming in manner and a true connoisseur of fine objects and Oriental rugs. To this day, Mr. Mohidin's company makes the most exclusive Kashmiri carpets, which continue to be exported to the best stores all over Europe and America.  Vibhuti Patel, an assistant editor at Newsweek International and an Indian who now lives in New York, says she remembers the time when Bloomingdales' buyers were regular visitors in the Kashmiri capital of Srinagar. The hard-eyed buyers came to place their customized orders -- "paler colors, pastels in classic designs, styles that would be more in keeping with Western color schemes" -- with Mr. Kathwari's uncle and his father-in-law, and first cousins, who ran the business after Mr. Mohidin.  "The Kathwaris' tiny factory still employs the most gifted rug weavers in Kashmir," Ms. Patel said yesterday. "But what a long way Farooq has come from that remote valley and a  family-run enterprise that is generations old! His grandfather, the shrewdest of businessmen, would have been justly proud of his achievements in the New World." The assembling of those achievements began in earnest in 1973, when Ethan Allen formed a joint venture with Mr. Kathwari to develop home furnishings products. In 1980, the joint venture company merged with Ethan Allen and Mr. Kathwari joined the company as a vice president. In 1981, he was promoted to senior vice president and was elected a director of the company. He became executive vice president in buyout of Ethan Allen from Interco and in 1993, he organized an initial public offering of the company's 1983, and president in 1985. In 1988 Ethan Allen made him chairman and CEO. In 1989, Mr. Kathwari led a management common stock. "Whatever I do, I do with passion," Mr. Kathwari said yesterday. "At every stage of my career, I have focused on doing my best. I don't take myself seriously, but I take my work very seriously." That element of seriousness is particularly applied to his colleagues. Mr. Kathwari is a huge believer in developing teams of decision-makers. "All the associates at our scores of stores in America and around the world are CEOs in their own right," he said. "I believe in a collaborative, cooperative approach, making sure that we are all going in the right direction. I have set about creating an entrepreneurial participant culture in Ethan Allen. From our sawmills to manufacturing plants to distribution centers to our in-house advertising unit, I have tried to infuse our organization with a forward-thinking entrepreneurial culture."Translation: Mr. Kathwari helps set clear priorities and then ensures that they are implemented. "My overriding goal is always to be that cricket captain," he said. "I want to help people become better at what they do. I'm not a control freak. I believe in treating my team members with dignity." There's little doubt that his approach works. This reporter got an opportunity some time back to observe Mr. Kathwari mingle with colleagues at the inauguration of a renovated Ethan Allen store near Atlanta. The scene was like a Southern revival meeting, with dozens of employees trying to hug him, get his attention, and even ask for his autograph. It's a fair bet that there aren't too many CEOs out there who elicit that kind of outpouring of sentiment from their employees. Part of that sentiment surely flows from the recognition that, under Mr. Kathwari's leadership, Ethan Allen has undergone a dramatic repositioning to increase the company's consumer reach and market share. Elements include the creation of a new corporate identity, the redesign of over 90% of its products, the renovation of its network of stores, and the retooling of its manufacturing and distribution operations, according to company literature. But part of that special relationship that Mr. Kathwari enjoys with his colleagues surely stems from the regularity with which he stays in touch with them. Yesterday morning, for example, he sent off several hundred e-mails asking for ideas concerning the development of new products. By the time he returned home to Westchester, his laptop had recorded several dozen responses. Again, not too many CEOs would stay so closely in touch with their workforce. "It helps that Ethan Allen is in only one business -- home furnishings," Mr. Kathwari said. "I'm not distracted. I can focus on what it takes to strengthen the company. A company is only as good as the people who work for it. Motivating people, as much as establishing financial goals, is part of my job description." The job also involves evangelizing in behalf of Ethan Allen. Mr. Kathwari chairs several nonprofit organizations including the Kashmir Study Group -- which attempts to fashion a peaceful solution for the long troubled land -- and of Refugees International. He's a life member of the prestigious Council on Foreign Relations,  a trustee of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, a director of the Henry L. Stimson Center, and of  the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University. The American Jewish Committee gave him its "National Human Relations Award"; and the Anti-Defamation League gave him its "Humanitarian Award."   Mr. Kathwari has special words for America. "I did it my way," he says of his success, "and I did it for America. I am profoundly moved by the history of this country -- I can actually visualize myself having lived here 200 years ago in Ethan Allen's time. America gave me the opportunity to be what I am." These are feelings that he will convey to President George W. Bush on Friday, when Mr. Kathwari attends a White House event. Appropriately enough, it's a musical tribute to another American president whom Mr. Kathwari of Srinagar, Danbury, Westchester and New York also admires, Abraham Lincoln.

Leadership Principles


An Interview with Farooq Kathwari, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Ethan Allen Interiors Inc.


Editors’ Note
Farooq Kathwari has been President of Ethan Allen since 1985 and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 1988. Prior to this, he served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Rothschild, Inc. In 1973, he formed a joint venture company with Ethan Allen, KEA International, Inc., to develop home furnishings products. In 1980, KEA merged with Ethan Allen, and he joined the company as the Vice President in charge of merchandising and international operations. In 2009, Kathwari was inducted into the American Furniture Hall of Fame. He is the former Chairman of the National Retail Federation and the American Home Furnishings Alliance. In addition to providing leadership in the home furnishings industry, Kathwari has served many humanitarian causes throughout his career. He is Chairman of the nonpartisan Kashmir Study Group, which he founded in 1996. He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He sits on the boards of numerous humanitarian and nonprofit organizations, including Refugees International, the International Rescue Committee, the Henry L. Stimson Center, and the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University. Among his many honors are the Outstanding American by Choice Award from the United States Government; the Eleanor Roosevelt Val-Kill Medal; Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year award; and the National Retail Federation’s Gold Medal Award.

He also holds two honorary doctorate degrees.
Company Brief
Offering interior design solutions through a network of nearly 300 dedicated design centers in the United States and abroad, Ethan Allen Interiors, Inc. (www.ethanallen.com) is a leading interior design company and manufacturer and retailer of home furnishings. The company’s 1,500 design professionals provide clients with comprehensive design expertise and service using the full range of Ethan Allen home furnishings.
How has the economic crisis impacted the Ethan Allen brand and what is your view on positioning the brand going forward?
				In December of 2008, I got my main leadership together and I used two analogies to explain our situation. The first was from my experience as a mountain climber. Mountains teach you that if you go too high, you can’t breathe and you have to come down. It’s okay to come down, because you stabilize yourself and then you can go back up. Staying at an altitude where you can’t breathe is deadly. I told my associates, “We are at about 20,000 feet. I would like us to come down to 17,000 feet, stabilize, and then go up again.”
The second analogy I used I learned from a farmer whose apple trees I used to help trim. He said, “A healthy tree needs to be trimmed, but don’t trim it too much at one time or you will kill it.” So in our process of pruning, we knew we had to be careful not to trim to such a degree that we killed our healthy tree.
With these things in mind, we were able to manage scaling back at Ethan Allen. We made very tough decisions on issues like consolidating our manufacturing and logistics operations and letting people go, which we didn’t want to do, but which was necessary to help make us stronger. It has also given us an opportunity; in the past year, we have accomplished more than we could have anticipated. Our people were ready for change, and they understood that reinvention was critical to our future success.
The good news is that since October 2009, business has been coming back. We are healthier and stronger, and we have been able to hire again at our manufacturing and retail operations. 
Key among the changes we had to make was the consolidation of our wood products to three U.S. facilities from the 13 we had a few years back. Last year, we also consolidated all upholstery manufacturing into one facility in North Carolina. Both moves allow us to go forward with our best manufacturing operations in the U.S. and still be competitive.
The next thing we looked at was logistics. We have to move furniture from our manufacturing plants to distribution centers to our clients’ homes across the country. We had been continuously improving this process, but last year gave us a real opportunity for change that we would not have had if business had continued at its pre-2008 pace. We consolidated all of our distribution logistics primarily into one major national distribution center.
Our way forward rests largely on the fact that we are a globally integrated company that still makes 70 percent of its products in the United States, while most of the rest of our industry has closed their U.S. operations and outsourced. The challenge of manufacturing in the United States today is a national problem. Unless you make a commitment to it and are willing to make strategic improvements at a very small margin, or even at a loss, you’re not going to be able to manufacture here.
We made the commitment for a number of reasons. First, quality and reliability are cornerstones of our brand, and our American manufacturing base fosters both and differentiates us favorably in the mind of the consumer. Second, we have the integrated business structure to support American manufacturing. And third, we have the strategy and technology in place to make our U.S. manufacturing efficient.
Outside of the plant consolidations, have there been other process changes that you have made in reaction to the weakened economy?
The recession gave us an opportunity to do something that has created a major competitive advantage for us. We decided to develop manufacturing processes in the U.S that allow us to deliver custom, made-to-order wood furniture products, mirroring our existing all-custom upholstery business. This was done to combat the commoditization happening in our industry, where others, especially those who manufacture in developing countries, may have a price advantage over us.
Starting with dining furniture, we began converting the manufacturing process in our wood products plants to a custom one. For 80 years, we have produced anywhere from 100 to 500 units of a completed table; now, we make parts that are assembled when an order comes in. That gives us the ability to offer a tremendous number of options and finishes to our clients and is also integral to maximizing efficiency.
We designed new retail footprints to maximize productivity per square foot and to be sure that going forward, all Ethan Allen Design Centers will be the right size for each location.


Ethan Allen Las Vegas Design Center

We developed new technologies, enhancing our state-of-the-art Web site; introducing touch screens to the Design Centers; and launching a new retail information system.
And we made changes in response to the new attitude of consumers – they were afraid to spend, and there is still reticence. We worked to offer rare savings opportunities and good financing terms. We did this because it was critical to maintaining our business stability and cash flow. Today, we are much stronger because of it.
What is it about the culture of the company that allowed your people to understand the need for change and the benefits that would result from it?
Change is not easy, but reinvention has always been a part of the culture at Ethan Allen. It’s leadership’s responsibility to accept the necessity of change and to manage it. We work hard to get the message across about why change is being made and why it’s important. Continuous communication is critical, both internally and externally. I speak to our associates every two months, and we have frequent communication meetings. As a result, most everybody is aware of what we are doing.
Across all industries, leaders talk about the opportunities in China, but many also talk about the challenges of doing business there. Have you been happy with how the brand is positioned in China?
We have built a presence there through a partner, and in a short period of time, together we have become one of the larger furniture retailers in China with 40 design centers there. 
Do you foresee opportunities for the brand in other emerging markets?
We do. We have invested a lot in the U.S. but are also focused overseas. We have a presence in a number of countries, from the Philippines to Japan to Taiwan to Thailand. Last year, we opened in Jordan and Dubai, and we’re looking at Europe. Ethan Allen provides a total package of one-stop shopping for home furnishings with great quality products, and on top of it, our philosophy is centered on service. We stand out because of the interior design expertise and help that comes as part of the package when you buy from Ethan Allen. People throughout the world desire a unique combination of products and services.
Has it been challenging for you to remain engaged in all parts of the business, especially as you’ve grown overseas?
No. When I was young, I was the captain of a cricket team. I base my management philosophy on that experience. My job as captain was to have all members feel that they were a part of one team and to make sure that team was well trained and did well. The difference between having a captain who plays with the team and as part of the team, versus having a captain who is not “playing” with the team, is critical to our success. Organizations need a captain who is right there with them.
Our business model at Ethan Allen is based on teams. We have hundreds of teams right now from manufacturing to logistics; each design center is run by a “captain.”
Motivation for me is like playing sports. You have to keep on playing and you have to do your best to win.
How much did your earlier role in competitive sports shape your management style?
As I mentioned above, the captain of a team plays with the team. I also strongly believe that leaders must conduct themselves fairly, establish priorities, and explain those priorities to their team members. At Ethan Allen, I use the word “justice” as part of our leadership principles. Justice means dealing fairly, which is not easy. It means consistently doing what you believe is right, which also means you’re willing to risk the occasional loss.
Ethan Allen’s leadership principles could just as easily be titled Kathwari’s leadership principles. Did you have to get your leadership team to buy in to that, and how critical was it to communicate that those principles are the core of the culture?
These principles have been part of our culture for many years, and they are the core of how we run the company. Our culture is based on doing what we believe is right. I don’t want people to hide things; if anything is wrong, we want to know. The culture is not about trying to please people externally just for the sake of pleasing them. We’re a public company so we have to make sure we do things right. Our culture dictates that people treat their associates with dignity but also maintain discipline. These are principles that our people want to follow through on.
Your culture is also focused on being a good corporate citizen. How critical is that focus, and is that a responsibility today of businesses and business leaders?
It’s part of the overall responsibility of any organization. But you have to make sure that you are doing well at home before you start doing things outside.
So as an organization, our primary responsibilities are to our customers. We have to treat them well, provide them with great service, and give them the best possible value. To me, that is social responsibility.
We also have thousands of people who work in our organization – they have families, so we have to make sure that their welfare is also taken into consideration.
Additionally, we are involved with communities where we work. Many of them depend on us, and it is our responsibility to deal with them fairly even though the past few years have been tough.
After that, we can get involved with other good causes.
Does it concern you that the U.S. is losing its competitive edge globally, and is there not enough being done to cultivate innovation and leadership?
That is a major concern. However, we have the opportunity to revitalize. This recession has given us an opportunity to do things we could not have done before, because our people are ready. Crisis has created an opportunity, and we should not miss it. The good news is that the U.S. today projects the diversity of the world; we have talent and ideas from all over. So as a nation, we need to go back to focusing on creative ideas rather than on financial maneuvering, as we have recently focused on.
Those who know you say it’s hard to imagine a time when you will slow down. Will that day come?
One of the other important responsibilities of leadership is to make sure you leave the organization stronger than when you came in, which means having strong people. As long as I am the CEO, I have to be the team captain. But when the day comes that I don’t have to be, then somebody else has to take it on. You cannot be a leader 70 or 80 percent; you have to be full charge or out.
Do you ever step back and appreciate your success, or do you always look ahead?
I’ve always believed in maintaining a balance between Ethan Allen and a lot of other things I do. I have been very interested in trying to help reach solutions in international conflict, and the plight of refugees and displaced people. This gives my life balance. While making money is okay, if that is the only measurement of success, you’re going to make a lot of mistakes and you will never be satisfied. My involvement with nonprofit organizations has given me an opportunity to contribute, and has also helped me maintain perspective, because when you look at world problems, our problems as an organization seem relatively small.•

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
