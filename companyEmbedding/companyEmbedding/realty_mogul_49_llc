In May 2013, RealtyMogul.com became the first crowdfunding online platform to have funded over $200 million in debt and equity transactions.[14][15][16]
The Model[edit]
Individuals invest by purchasing shares in a RealtyMogul.com limited liability company (“LLC”) that in turn invests into a secondary LLC or Limited Partnership (“LP”) that holds title to the real property. The entirety of the Realty Mogul LLCs are managed by RM Manager, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of RealtyMogul.com.[17]
Term of investment differs between debt and equity investments. Loan investments in debt range from 1 to 10 years and distribute proceeds to investors monthly,[18] while equity investments range from 3 to 10 years and provide investors with quarterly distributions of proceeds.[19]

History[edit]
RealtyMogul.com was founded in 2012 and launched in 2013 by Jilliene Helman and Justin Hughes.[6][7]
RealtyMogul.com raised $9 million in Series A funding in 2014[8][9] and $35 million in Series B funding in July 2015.[10][11] The Series A funding was led by Canaan Partners[12] and the Series B funding by Sorenson Capital.[13]
In May 2013, RealtyMogul.com became the first crowdfunding online platform to have funded over $200 million in debt and equity transactions.[14][15][16]
The Model[edit]
Individuals invest by purchasing shares in a RealtyMogul.com limited liability company (“LLC”) that in turn invests into a secondary LLC or Limited Partnership (“LP”) that holds title to the real property. The entirety of the Realty Mogul LLCs are managed by RM Manager, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of RealtyMogul.com.[17]
Term of investment differs between debt and equity investments. Loan investments in debt range from 1 to 10 years and distribute proceeds to investors monthly,[18] while equity investments range from 3 to 10 years and provide investors with quarterly distributions of proceeds.[19]
RealtyMogul.com charges deal sponsors a commission on funds raised with a tiered fee schedule based on the amount. Investors are charged a 1-2% annual investor reporting and technology fee, which is based on invested capital.[20][21]
Investors are presented with potential investment opportunities pursuant to Rule 506 (b) and 506(c) of Regulation D of the Securities Act, section 4(a)(2),[22][23] and Title IV of the JOBS Act, regulation A.[24]

Debt Financing[edit]
RealtyMogul.com offers two types of debt financing opportunities for its online investors: Bridge Loans and Mezzanine Debt.[25] Both have investment terms that range from 1 to 10 years and distribute proceeds to investors on a monthly basis.[26]
Equity Investments[edit]
RealtyMogul.com’s equity investment opportunities allow online members to pool their money to purchase a piece of a specific commercial property, in commercial buy and hold transactions.

1031 Exchange[edit]
In March 2016, RealtyMogul.com began offering its online members investments that were 1031 exchange eligible.[29] A 1031 Exchange (also referred to as “like-kind” exchange or “starker” exchange[30]) refers to section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. IRC 1031 provides an exception that allows individuals to postpone paying tax on the gain received in a business or real estate transaction if he or she reinvests the proceeds in similar property as part of a qualifying, like-kind exchange. Qualifying transactions pursuant to IRC Section 1031 are tax-deferred, but not tax-free.[31]

The entirety of the Realty Mogul LLCs are managed by RM Manager, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of RealtyMogul.com.[17]
Term of investment differs between debt and equity investments. Loan investments in debt range from 1 to 10 years and distribute proceeds to investors monthly,[18] while equity investments range from 3 to 10 years and provide investors with quarterly distributions of proceeds.[19]
RealtyMogul.com charges deal sponsors a commission on funds raised with a tiered fee schedule based on the amount. Investors are charged a 1-2% annual investor reporting and technology fee, which is based on invested capital.[20][21]
Investors are presented with potential investment opportunities pursuant to Rule 506 (b) and 506(c) of Regulation D of the Securities Act, section 4(a)(2),[22][23] and Title IV of the JOBS Act, regulation A.[24]

IRC 1031 provides an exception that allows individuals to postpone paying tax on the gain received in a business or real estate transaction if he or she reinvests the proceeds in similar property as part of a qualifying, like-kind exchange. Qualifying transactions pursuant to IRC Section 1031 are tax-deferred, but not tax-free.[31]
