Jantz Management’s investment strategy is to develop quantitative models that synthesize fundamental financial principles and market dynamics to estimate a firm’s long-term value. Using these models, investment opportunities are detected where current market price and a company’s value are misaligned. By holding an appropriate number of these opportunities, the aggregate portfolio’s performance will be greater than the relevant index but with similar risk characteristics. Gains are harvested on a prescribed periodic basis and no fund will be allowed to grow beyond its efficient size.
Quantitative Methodology
Fundamental to the firm’s approach is the use of System Dynamics. Developed by Jay W. Forrester, Professor Emeritus, MIT, System Dynamics is a powerful tool for modeling complex systems where feedback, time delays, and qualitative information are important in understanding the system’s dynamic behavior. This discipline provides the methodological framework allowing the integration of key financial concepts and market structures into models that can be tested and improved over time. Dynamic probabilistic parameterization is used to calibrate a handful of important factors within the system dynamics models, with great care taken to avoid data mining. Each company’s current and historic financial data is put through the model to determine if its stock is mispriced in the marketplace. Systematic application across an asset class results in a rigorous and dispassionate process that leaves no opportunity undiscovered.
Discipline
Jantz Management distinguishes itself through its disciplined adherence to the models and processes – investment decisions are made based on the sound fundamentals embodied in the models, not hype, or emotion.
Values
Jantz Management seeks to provide its clients with choice in the values they wish to have reflected in their investment portfolios. For that reason, the set of values reflected in the firm’s various portfolios are distinct. Nonetheless, all the firm’s portfolios have at their core, models developed using our quantitative methodology.

ESG PortfoliosHome / Products / ESG Portfolios





JM’s ESG portfolios utilize the firm’s quantitative stock selection models and optimization techniques (designed to minimize the variance of portfolio return while maintaining a high rate of expected return) as a mechanism for integrating non-financial information on companies’ environmental, social and governance practices into the portfolio construction process. JM believes that ESG data captures non-financial risks associated with firm behavior and that it is an underutilized source (signal) for enhancing portfolio returns and reducing portfolio risk.
JM’s mission is to provide a diversified socially responsible investment fund that has at its core an emphasis on performance and positive values while promoting a more sustainable world. We invest in firms that promote health and well-being of individuals, communities and the environment through their products, services and fair business practices affecting all their stakeholders.
ESG portfolios seek to meet or exceed return to the index over the long run. There are currently four available products:

JM Large Cap ESG applies our optimized ESG investment process to the S&P 500 universe. It is designed to deliver substantial excess return over the long-term in the large-cap space, significantly exceeding the performance of the S&P 500 Index.
JM Mid-Cap ESG applies our optimized ESG investment process to the S&P 400 universe. It is designed to deliver substantial excess return over the long-term in the mid-cap space, significantly exceeding the performance of the S&P 400 Index.
JM Small-Cap ESG applies our optimized ESG investment process to the S&P 600 Index universe. The goal is to deliver superior excess return over the long-term in the small-cap space, significantly exceeding the performance of the S&P 600 Index.

Fama and French as well as others, have demonstrated that on average, value investing outperforms growth investing where “value” is synonymous with “cheap” and “growth” is synonymous with “expensive”. In this context, “value” is often defined by a low ratio of stock price to the book value of the company while “growth” is identified as a high price to book ratio.
Jantz Management improves and redefines “value” as valuation. JM’s dynamic valuation methodology simulates future growth in its estimates of the value of each stock in the investable universe. JM’s forecast of stock value is used to estimate the expected rate of return and dispersion (risk) relative to its current market price. In general, JM uses a statistical technique to optimize the proportion of each stock held in the portfolio such that the expected portfolio risk is minimized for given portfolio requirements. Portfolio requirements, including a required level for the portfolio’s expected rate of return, are entered into the optimization process as constraints. The resulting Model Folios are used to change the portfolio weights for a target portfolio. JM’s strategy emphasizes adherence to the quantitative models and processes and it is designed to remove many of the human cognitive limitations and biases that inhibit portfolio performance.
Management for total return rather than to a benchmark also increases the performance capabilities of the firm’s portfolios. Consequently the portfolio does not track the benchmark and for short periods can even under-perform it. Nevertheless, the result is a potentially higher average level of return at a level of risk designed to be approximately that of the comparable index fund benchmark.
Further, JM’s quantitative optimization approach to portfolio construction is sector agnostic, allowing the fund to capture the full benefit of market inefficiencies that cause securities to be underpriced or overpriced without regard to industry sector. Risk is reduced through diversification by holding positions in a substantial number of equities – ranging from 50 to 100 depending on the portfolio. The size of each position is weighted to enhance the risk-adjusted return to the portfolio with target weights at the time of portfolio rebalance of no greater than 3.0%. Finally, profits are taken based on monthly re-evaluations of the entire set of index constituents.
Value portfolios seek to significantly outperform the index over the long run. There are currently three available products:

JM Value applies our optimized value methodology to the S&P 500 universe and is the product which launched the firm in 2002. With it, the firm’s goal is to, over the long-term, significantly exceed the performance of the S&P 500 Index.
JM Mid-Cap Value applies our optimized value methodology to the S&P 400 universe. It is designed to deliver high excess return over the long-term in the mid-cap space, significantly exceeding the performance of the S&P 400 Index.
JM Small-Cap Value applies our optimized value methodology to the S&P 600 Index universe. The goal is to deliver superior active return over the long-term in the small-cap space, significantly exceeding the performance of the S&P 600 Index.

Compound Annual Return (CAR) – The percentage that a given amount or number would need to increase each year over a multi-year period in order to reach a corresponding cumulative total. Annualized returns are compound annual returns.
The S&P 500 is the Standard & Poor’s composite index of 500 large-cap stocks, a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stock prices.
The S&P 400 is the Standard & Poor’s composite index of 400 mid-cap stocks, a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stock prices.
The S&P 600 is the Standard & Poor’s composite index of 600 small-cap stocks, a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stock prices.
Volatility (standard deviation) measures the dispersion or uncertainty in a random variable (in this case, investment returns). It measures the degree of variation of returns around the mean or (average) return. The greater the variation of the investment returns, the higher the standard deviation will be. For this reason, standard deviation is often used as one measure of investment risk. A more volatile stock or investment would have a higher standard deviation.
