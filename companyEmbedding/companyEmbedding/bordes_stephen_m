 Truco Enterprises is the proud maker of On The Border® retail products, a delicious line of crispy, authentic Mexican-style chips, flavorful salsas and creamy queso dips. Our passion for delivering great-tasting, consumer-preferred products has helped us become the favorite snack of millions and one of the fastest growing national brands of chips and dips in the country. Read moreLess Truco products always feature the Black Diamond Logo  , a symbol of our quality for over 20 years. 
 Where can I purchase On The Border® products?We can help you locate your favorite On The Border® chips and dips. Click here to start , and share some information with us.What products are available under the On The Border® brand?
There is an On The Border® chip or dip for every occasion! Look for the following products at your local retailer.

Where is the expiration date on my On The Border® product? 
You can find the expiration or “Best By” date, printed on the curved part of the jar between the edge of the label and the lid. This date is a recommendation only and should be considered in conjunction with how long the package has been opened.

You can find the expiration or “Enjoy By” date, printed on the upper right corner of the bag. This date is a recommendation only and should be considered in conjunction with how long the package has been opened.

The “Best By” or “Enjoy By” date is a guideline for how long you can keep a product unopened in your pantry to enjoy maximum freshness and quality. We guarantee product freshness through this date. Therefore, if the product is first opened before the “Best By” or “Enjoy By” date and does not meet expectations, we will replace it.
For additional information, please review the next FAQ.
The On The Border® product in my pantry is past the date printed on the package. Is it still safe to use? 
We stamp all of our products with an “Enjoy By” or “Best By” date to ensure food safety and optimal quality. The “Enjoy By” date is a guideline for how long you can keep a product unopened in your pantry to enjoy maximum freshness and quality.  We guarantee product freshness through this date. So if the product is first-opened before the “Enjoy By” date and does not meet expectations, we will replace it.
Please note, this date is a recommendation only and should be considered in conjunction with how long the package has been opened.
How long will my jar of salsa/queso stay good after I open it?We recommend using all On The Border® salsa and queso within 10-14 days of opening the jar. Once opened, a product’s shelf life can vary according to the temperature of your refrigerator, exposure to air and/or other factors beyond our control. We suggest that you pour what you need into a bowl, re-close the jar tightly and refrigerate your dip to maximize freshness.Are On The Border® products made in the USA? Where do the ingredients come from?Truco, the makers of On The Border® products, manufactures all of our snacks in the United States. We partner with facilities across the U.S. to make our products according to our strict quality standards, and the vast majority of our ingredients are sourced from U.S. suppliers.I noticed that some of your chip bags say “Improved Authentic Taste.” What changed? Why?Truco works hard to ensure that all of our On The Border® products are of exceptional quality. Based on nationwide consumer taste testing and feedback, we have optimized several of our chip products to ensure we deliver the taste profile and overall experience most preferred by consumers. We hope you agree that these efforts make our chips better than ever! If you have additional questions about a specific product, please click here to contact us for more information.Are On The Border® products gluten free?All of our On The Border® retail products are gluten free. Our products must pass finished goods testing to meet FDA requirements for gluten-free labeling, and we prominently state “Gluten Free” on our packaging.Are On The Border® products manufactured on equipment shared with other products containing peanuts or other allergens? On The Border® products are made with ingredients that do not contain peanuts, and you can rest assured that all of our manufacturing facilities follow strict allergen control programs and meticulous testing procedures designed to effectively manage allergens.Where can I find nutrition facts for On The Border® products?
You can always find full nutrition facts and ingredients for our products on the package.

Here are a few nutritional facts that are true across our products:

All On The Border® products are made with no artificial colors or MSG, and all have 0g trans fat per serving, are gluten free and vegetarian.

If you’d like more information on the nutritional facts for any one of our products, please check the nutrition facts panel on the back of the package or Contact us with your question.
Why don’t your chips and dips taste like they do at the On The Border® restaurants?Due to different manufacturing processes, the restaurant items and the packaged products sold at your local retailer are not exactly alike. Each On The Border® restaurant creates menu items daily for onsite consumption, while the On The Border® products that Truco makes available at retailers across the country are produced to have a longer shelf life. All On The Border® products are made with great care and adhere to high quality standards to ensure you can enjoy our delicious chips and dips both at the restaurant and at home.Where can I get coupons for On The Border® products?On The Border® products are periodically offered on discount or promotion at retailers across the country. Though we don’t currently offer coupons online, be sure to check your local store for great deals on our chips and dips.Can On The Border® chip bags be recycled?Most chip bags, including ours, aren’t yet recyclable. However, at Truco we are always looking for ways to reduce our environmental impact and evaluating the best options available to do so.What happened to On The Border® margarita mixes? I can’t find them at my local store.At Truco, we strive to deliver consumers the products they want at the highest quality, and our team is continually developing exciting, new innovations. We recently discontinued our On The Border® drink mixes due to a decline in consumer interest. But be sure to keep an eye on the shelves at your local retailer for our next new product.I own a store/restaurant/distribution company. How can I carry On The Border® products?We’ll be happy to provide you more information. Please click here to contact us, and share some information about your business and interest in our products.Do your products contain GMOs or genetically modified ingredients?
