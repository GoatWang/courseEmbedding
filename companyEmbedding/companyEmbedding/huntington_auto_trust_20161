Gentlemen:

the Class A-1 Auto Loan Asset Backed Notes, the Class A-2
Auto Loan Asset Backed Notes, the Class A-3 Auto Loan Asset
Backed Notes, the Class A-4 Auto Loan Asset Backed Notes, the
Class B Auto Loan Asset Backed Notes, the Class C Auto
Loan Asset Backed Notes and the Class D Auto Loan Asset Backed
Notes (collectively, the “ Notes ”) described in
the final prospectus dated November 28, 2016 (the “
Prospectus ”), which has been filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ Commission

as amended (the “ Act ”). As described in the

Company pursuant to a trust agreement among the Company, Citibank,

issued pursuant to an indenture (the “ Indenture

Association, as indenture trustee (the “ Indenture
Trustee ”).

In that
connection, we are generally familiar with the proceedings taken or
to be taken in connection with the proposed authorization, issuance
and sale of the Notes, and have examined and relied upon copies of
such statutes, documents, corporate records and other instruments
as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this
opinion, including the Prospectus, the Underwriting Agreement and
current drafts of the Indenture (including the form of the Notes
included as an exhibit thereto), the Receivables Sale Agreement,
the Sale Agreement, the Servicing Agreement, the Administration

given to such terms in, or by reference in, the

Huntington Adds to ABS Pipeline Before 2016 Closes


							November 22, 2016							by Larissa Paddenlpadden @ royalmedia.com





Huntington Auto Finance issued its first — and likely last — securitization for the year on Friday. The 2016-1 trust is backed by $1.5 billion prime auto loans with a weighted average Fico of 765, according to a presale report from S&P Global.
The bank also issued just one auto loan securitization in 2015 — its first since 2012 — which was backed by $750 million of prime auto loans.
The loans in the 2016-1 trust have a weighted average LTV of 91.29%, an average original term of 69 months, and an average seasoning of 13 months, all relatively unchanged from the previous year’s offering.
“Huntington currently has one outstanding public retail securitization — series 2015-1–which was rated by S&P Global Ratings. Series 2012-1 and 2012-2 paid off in 2016,” S&P wrote in the report. “Since the [2015] transaction closed, the credit support has increased as a percentage of the amortizing pool balance. The transaction is performing in line with our initial ECNL [expected cumulative net loss] projection.”
The agency expects the 2016-1 transaction to experience cumulative net losses in the 0.70%-0.80% range, S&P added.
As of Sept. 30, Huntington’s serviced portfolio was at approximately $10.9 billion — a 10% increase over the same time a year prior. Net losses increased to 0.17%, also as of Sept. 30, up from 0.13% at the same time a year prior, while 31+-days delinquencies were 0.79%, down from 0.92% at the same time a year prior, according to S&P.

Powers . The purpose of the Issuer is, and the Issuer shall
have the power and authority, to engage in the following
activities:

(a) to issue the Notes pursuant to
the Indenture and the Certificates pursuant to this Agreement, and
to sell, transfer and exchange the Notes and the Certificates and
to pay interest on and principal of the Notes to the Noteholders
and to make distributions to the Certificateholders;

(c) to assign, Grant, transfer,

(d) to enter into and perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a
party;

(e) to engage in those activities,
including entering into agreements, that are necessary, suitable or
convenient to accomplish the foregoing or are incidental thereto or
connected therewith; and

(f) subject to compliance with the
Transaction Documents, to engage in such other activities as may be
required in connection with conservation of the Trust
Estate
 
2



and the making of distributions to
the Certificateholders and payments to the Noteholders.

Each of the Owner Trustee and the
Administrator, as applicable, is hereby authorized to engage in the
foregoing activities on behalf of the Issuer. Neither the Issuer
nor any Person acting on behalf of the Issuer shall engage in any
activity other than in connection with the foregoing or other than
as required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents.

Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Transaction Documents or in any other document,
neither the Issuer nor the Owner Trustee (nor any agent of either
person) shall be authorized or empowered to acquire any other
investments, reinvest any proceeds of the Issuer or engage in
activities other than the foregoing, and, in particular neither the
Issuer nor the Owner Trustee (nor any agent of either person) shall
be authorized or empowered to do anything that would cause the
Issuer to fail to qualify as a grantor trust under subtitle A,
chapter 1, subchapter J, part I, subpart E of the Code.

SECTION 2.4. Appointment of the
Owner Trustee . The Depositor hereby appoints the Owner Trustee
as trustee of the Issuer effective as of the date hereof, to have
all the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

SECTION 2.5. Initial Capital
Contribution of Trust Estate . As of the date of the Original
Trust Agreement, the Depositor sold, assigned, transferred,
conveyed and set over to the Owner Trustee the sum of $1. The Owner
Trustee hereby acknowledges receipt in trust from the Depositor, as
of such date, of the foregoing contribution, which shall constitute
the initial Trust Estate and shall be deposited in the Collection
Account.

SECTION 2.6. Declaration of
Trust . The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will hold the
Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the conditions set forth
herein for the use and benefit of the Certificateholders, subject
to the obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction Documents.
It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Issuer
constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust Statute and
that (i) this Agreement constitute the governing instrument of
such statutory trust and (ii) for United States federal, state
and local income and franchise tax purposes, the Issuer shall be
treated as a grantor trust under subtitle A, chapter 1, subchapter
J, part I, subpart E of the Code, with the assets of the Issuer
constituting the Receivables and other assets held by the Issuer,
and the Notes constituting non-recourse debt of the
Certificateholder(s), provided that if it is successfully asserted
by the appropriate tax authorities that the Issuer is not properly
characterized as a grantor trust under subtitle A, chapter 1,
subchapter J, part I, subpart E of the Code, the Issuer shall be
treated, for United States federal, state and local income and
franchise tax purposes, as (A) a disregarded entity if there
is only one beneficial owner for United States federal income tax
purposes of the Certificates and any Notes that are treated as
equity in the Issuer, or (B) a partnership (other than an
association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a
corporation) if there is more than one beneficial owner for United
States federal income tax purposes of the Certificates and any
Notes that are treated as equity for United States federal income
tax purposes in the Issuer, with the assets of the partnership
being the Receivables and other assets held by the Issuer, the
partners of the partnership being the Certificateholders and the
holders of the Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer for
United
 
3


States federal income tax purposes, and the
remaining Notes constituting indebtedness of the partnership. The
parties hereto and each Certificateholder, by acceptance of a
Certificate, agree to treat the Issuer in accordance with the
intention that the Issuer be characterized as a grantor trust under
subtitle A, chapter 1, subchapter J, part I, subpart E of the Code
and, unless otherwise required by appropriate taxing authorities or
by law, not to take any action or, direct any other party to take
any action, inconsistent therewith, including, but not limited to,
modifying, or directing any other party to modify, the terms of a
Receivable unless the modification is a Permitted Modification. In
furtherance of the foregoing, (i) the purpose of the Issuer
shall be to protect and conserve the assets of the Issuer, and the
Issuer shall not at any time engage in or carry on any kind of
business for United States federal income tax purposes or any kind
of commercial activity and (ii) the Issuer and Owner Trustee
(upon direction from the Certificateholder) (and any agent of
either person) shall take, or refrain from taking, all such action
as is necessary to maintain the status of the Issuer as a grantor
trust under subtitle A, chapter 1, subchapter J, part I, subpart E
of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or otherwise, neither the Issuer nor the Owner Trustee
(nor any agent of either person) shall (1) acquire any assets
or dispose of any portion of the Issuer other than pursuant to the
specific provisions of this Agreement, (2) vary the investment
of the Issuer within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section
301.7701-4(c) or (3) substitute new investments or reinvest so
as to enable the Issuer to take advantage of variations in the
market to improve the investment of any Certificateholder. The
provisions of this Trust Agreement shall be interpreted consistent
with and to further this intention of the parties. The parties
agree that, unless otherwise required by appropriate tax
authorities, the Issuer will file or cause to be filed annual or
other necessary tax returns, reports and other forms consistent
with the foregoing characterization of the Issuer for United States
federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes. No
election will be made by or on behalf of the Issuer to be
classified as an association taxable as a corporation for United
States federal income tax purposes. Effective as of the date
hereof, the Owner Trustee shall have all rights, powers and duties
set forth herein and, to the extent not inconsistent herewith, in
the Statutory Trust Statute with respect to accomplishing the
purposes of the Issuer. The Owner Trustee has heretofore filed the
Certificate of Trust with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as required by Section 3810(a) of the Statutory Trust
Statute, such filing hereby being ratified and approved in all
respects. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Statutory Trust
Statute to the contrary, it is the intention of the parties hereto
that the Issuer constitute a “business trust” within
the meaning of Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the Bankruptcy
Code.

SECTION 2.7. Organizational
Expenses; Liabilities of the Holders .

(a) The Servicer shall pay
organizational expenses of the Issuer as they may arise.

(b) No Certificateholder (including
the Depositor if the Depositor becomes a Certificateholder) shall
have any personal liability for any liability or obligation of the
Issuer.

SECTION 2.8. Title to the Trust
Estate . Legal title to all the Trust Estate shall be vested at
all times in the Issuer as a separate legal entity.

SECTION 2.9. Representations and
Warranties of the Depositor . The Depositor hereby represents
and warrants to the Owner Trustee that:

(a) Existence and Power . The
Depositor is a limited liability company validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has, in
all material respects, all power and authority required to carry on
its business as now conducted. The Depositor has obtained all
necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction where the
failure to do so would materially and adversely affect the ability
of the Depositor to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents.

(b) Authorization and No
Contravention . The execution, delivery and performance by the
Depositor of each Transaction Document to which it is a party
(i) have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of the Depositor and (ii) do not contravene or constitute
a default under (A) any applicable law, rule or regulation,
(B) its organizational instruments or (C) any material
agreement, contract, order or other instrument to which it is a
party or its property is subject (other than violations of such
laws, rules, regulations, indenture or agreements which do not
affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of such
agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by,
or the Depositor’s ability to perform its obligations under,
the Transaction Documents to which it is a party).

(c) No Consent Required . No
approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Depositor of any
Transaction Document other than (i) UCC filings,
(ii) approvals and authorizations that have previously been
obtained and filings which have previously been made and
(iii) approvals, authorizations or filings which, if not
obtained or made, would not have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Depositor to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

(d) Binding Effect . Each of
the Transaction Documents to which the Depositor is a party
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Depositor enforceable against the Depositor in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership,
conservatorship or other similar laws affecting creditors’
rights generally and, if applicable, the rights of creditors of
limited liability companies from time to time in effect or by
general principles of equity or other similar laws of general
application relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles
of equity.

(e) No Proceedings . There is
no Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Depositor,
threatened against the Depositor which, either in any one instance
or in the aggregate, would result in any material adverse change in
the business, operations, financial condition, properties or assets
of the Depositor, or in any material impairment of the right or
ability of the Depositor to carry on its business substantially as
now conducted, or in any material liability on the part of the
Depositor, or which would render
 
5



invalid this Agreement or the
Receivables or the obligations of the Depositor contemplated
herein, or which would materially impair the ability of the
Depositor to perform under the terms of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document.

SECTION 2.10. Situs of Issuer
. The Issuer shall be located in the State of Delaware (it being
understood that the Issuer may have bank accounts located and
maintained outside of Delaware).

SECTION 2.11. Covenants of the
Certificateholders . Each Certificateholder, by becoming an
owner of a Certificate and beneficial owner of the Issuer, hereby
acknowledges and agrees (a) that the Certificateholder is
subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement,
to which the Certificateholder agrees to be bound; and
(b) that it shall not take any position in such
Certificateholder’s tax returns inconsistent with
Section 2.6 herein and Section 2.15 of the
Indenture.

ARTICLE III

CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFER OF
CERTIFICATES

SECTION 3.1. Initial
Ownership . Upon the formation of the Issuer and until the
issuance of the Certificates, the Depositor shall be the sole
beneficiary of the Issuer and, upon the issuance of the initial
Certificate, the Depositor will no longer be a beneficiary of the
Issuer, except to the extent that the Depositor is a
Certificateholder.

SECTION 3.2. Authorization of the
Certificates . Concurrently with the sale of the Transferred
Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale Agreement, at the
direction of the Depositor, (a) a single Book-Entry
Certificate shall be executed by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Issuer and authenticated and delivered in the name of
Cede & Co. or (b) a single Definitive Certificate
shall be executed by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer and
authenticated and delivered by the Certificate Registrar to or upon
the written order of the Depositor. The Certificates shall
represent, in the aggregate, 100% of the Percentage Interest in the
Issuer and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, be fully paid and nonassessable.

SECTION 3.3. Book-Entry
Certificates .

(a) Each of the Certificates will be
issued in the form of one or more typewritten certificates,
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, representing
the Book-Entry Certificates, to be delivered to the Indenture
Trustee, as initial agent for the Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf
of, the Issuer; provided , however , that, upon
payment in full of principal and interest on the Notes, the
Indenture Trustee (or such other Person that is then the Paying
Agent) will transfer, upon written request of the Administrator, on
behalf of the Issuer, any such certificates it is then holding to
the Owner Trustee, as agent for the Clearing Agency. The Book-Entry
Certificates shall be issued in an aggregate nominal principal
amount of $100,000 (which shall be deemed to be the equivalent of
100,000 units, with $1 of principal amount the equivalent of 1
unit), and all beneficial interests in the Book-Entry Certificates
shall be owned, in the minimum
 
6



principal amount of $2,000 and
integral multiples of $1 in excess thereof. The Issuer shall not
issue any Certificate that would cause the aggregate nominal
principal amount of all Certificates to exceed $100,000, or 100,000
units, without the prior written consent of all Certificateholders.
No distributions of moneys to the Certificateholders under the
Transaction Documents shall be deemed to reduce the nominal
principal amount of any Certificate prior to payment in full of all
Notes; provided, however , that the final aggregate $100,000
distributed to the Certificateholders under the Transaction
Documents upon final distribution of the Trust Estate and
termination of the Issuer pursuant to Sections 9.1 and
9.2 shall be deemed to repay the aggregate nominal principal
amount of the Certificates in full; provided, further , that
any failure to pay in full the nominal principal amount of a
Certificate on such final distribution date shall not result in any
recourse to, claim against or liability of any Person for such
shortfall. Any amounts payable to the Certificateholders on or in
respect of the Certificates under the Transaction Documents shall
be paid and allocated to the various Certificateholders ratably
based on their respective Percentage Interests. Such Certificates
shall initially be registered on the Certificate Register in the
name of Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC as the initial
Clearing Agency, and no Certificateholder will receive a Definitive
Certificate representing such Certificateholder’s interest in
such Certificate, except as provided in Section 3.5 .
Unless and until definitive, fully registered Certificates (
“ Definitive Certificates ”) are issued pursuant
to Section 3.5 :

(i) the provisions of this Section
shall be in full force and effect;

(ii) the Certificate Registrar and
the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing
Agency for all purposes of this Agreement (including the payment of
amounts payable under the Transaction Documents and the giving of
instructions or directions hereunder) as the sole
Certificateholders, and shall have no obligation to the Certificate
Owners;

(iii) to the extent that the
provisions of this Section conflict with any other provisions of
this Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall
control;

(iv) the rights of Certificate
Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and
shall be limited to those established by law and/or agreement
between or among such Certificate Owners and the Clearing Agency
and/or the Clearing Agency Participants or Persons acting through
Clearing Agency Participants. Pursuant to the Depository Agreement,
unless and until Definitive Certificates are issued pursuant to
Section 3.5 , the initial Clearing Agency shall make
book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and
receive and transmit payments due under the Transaction Documents
with regard to the Certificates to such Clearing Agency
Participants;

(v) whenever this Agreement requires
or permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or
directions of Certificateholders representing a
 
7



specified percentage of the
Certificate Percentage Interest, the Clearing Agency shall deliver
instructions to the Owner Trustee only to the extent that it has
received instructions to such effect from Certificate Owners and/or
Clearing Agency Participants or Persons acting through Clearing
Agency Participants owning or representing, respectively, such
required percentage of the beneficial interest in the
Certificates;

(vi) owners of a beneficial interest
in a Book-Entry Certificate will not be entitled to have any
portion of a Book-Entry Certificate registered in their names and
will not be considered to be the Certificate Owners or
Certificateholders of any Certificates under this Trust Agreement;
and

(vii) payments on a Book-Entry
Certificate will be made to the Clearing Agency or its nominee as
the registered owner thereof and none of the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating
to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in
a Book-Entry Certificate or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any records relating to the beneficial ownership
interests.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary herein, so long as a Book-Entry Certificate remains
outstanding and is held by or on behalf of the Clearing Agency,
transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate, in whole or in part, shall
only be made in accordance with Section 3.3(a) .
Subject to clauses (i) - (iii)  of
Section 3.3(a) , transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate
shall be limited to transfers of such Book-Entry Certificate in
whole, but not in part, to a nominee of the Clearing Agency or to a
successor of the Clearing Agency or such successor’s
nominee.

In the event that a Book-Entry
Certificate is exchanged for one or more Definitive Certificates
pursuant to Section 3.5 , such Certificates may be
exchanged for one another only in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement and with such procedures as may be from time to time
adopted by the Issuer and the Owner Trustee.

SECTION 3.4. Notices to Clearing
Agency . Whenever a notice or other communication to the
Certificateholders is required under this Agreement, unless and
until Definitive Certificates are issued to Certificate Owners
pursuant to Section 3.5 , the Owner Trustee shall give
all such notices and communications specified herein to be given to
the Certificateholders to the Clearing Agency and shall have no
obligation to the Certificate Owners.

SECTION 3.5. Definitive
Certificates .

(a) If (i) the Depositor
advises the Owner Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency is no
longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities
with respect to the Certificates, and the Depositor is unable to
locate a qualified successor or (ii) the Depositor at its
option advises the Owner Trustee in writing that it elects to
terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency, then
the Clearing Agency shall notify all Certificate Owners and the
Owner Trustee of the occurrence of
 
8



any such event and of the
availability of Definitive Certificates representing the
Certificates to Certificate Owners requesting the same. Upon
surrender to the Owner Trustee of the typewritten Certificate or
Certificates representing the Book-Entry Certificates by the
Clearing Agency, accompanied by re-registration instructions, the
Issuer shall execute and the Owner Trustee shall authenticate
Definitive Certificates representing the Certificates in accordance
with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. None of the Issuer,
the Certificate Registrar or the Owner Trustee shall be liable for
any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively
rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions.
Upon the issuance of Definitive Certificates representing the
Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall recognize such Holders of the
Definitive Certificates as the applicable
Certificateholders.

(b) Subject to the transfer
restrictions contained herein and in the Certificates, any Holder
of a Certificate may transfer all or any portion of the Percentage
Interest (subject to the requirements set forth in Sections
3.3 and 3.7) evidenced by such Certificate upon
surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee, and with such signature
guarantees and evidence of authority of the Person signing the
instrument of transfer as the Owner Trustee may reasonably require,
and accompanied by the documents required by this Article III.
Promptly upon the receipt of such documents and receipt by the
Owner Trustee of the transferor’s Certificate, the Owner
Trustee shall record the name of the transferee as a
Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in the Certificate
Register and issue, execute and deliver to such Certificateholder a
Certificate evidencing such Percentage Interest. In the event a
transferor transfers only a portion of its Percentage Interest, the
Owner Trustee shall register and issue to such transferor a new
Certificate evidencing such transferor’s new Percentage
Interest and shall issue, execute and deliver to the transferee a
new Certificate evidencing such transferee’s Percentage
Interest. Subsequent to each transfer of a beneficial interest and
upon the issuance of the new Certificate or Certificates, the Owner
Trustee shall cancel and destroy in accordance with its customary
practices the Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such
transfer. The Owner Trustee may treat, for all purposes whatsoever
(other than as required under applicable law), the Person in whose
name any Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the
Percentage Interest evidenced by such Certificate without regard to

SECTION 3.6. Registration of the
Certificates . Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as an
agent of the Issuer, in its capacity as “Certificate
Registrar” (the “ Certificate Registrar ”)
shall maintain at its Corporate Trust Office, or at the office of
any agent appointed by it and approved in writing by the
Certificateholders at the time of such appointment, a register (the
“ Certificate Register ”) for the registration
and transfer of any Certificate. Prior to the due presentment for
registration of transfer of any Certificate, the Owner Trustee, the

(as of the applicable Record Date) as the owner of such Certificate
for the purpose of receiving distributions on such Certificate and
for all other purposes whatsoever. For the avoidance of
 
9


doubt, a Certificate is not negotiable and the
records maintained by the Certificate Registrar in the Certificate
Register with respect to each Certificate and its related
registered owner are intended to cause the Certificates to be
issued in registered form, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation section 5f.103-1(c), and shall record (a) the
Percentage Interest evidenced by each Certificate and (b) all
distributions made to each Certificateholder with respect to the

convey or otherwise transfer all or any of its right, title and
interest in the related Certificate. Each purchaser and transferee
of a Definitive Certificate, and any fiduciary acting on behalf of
a purchaser or transferee of a Definitive Certificate, will be
required to provide a Certificate Investor Representation Letter

Depositor or any of its Affiliates) to it is being made in reliance
on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A, and

meaning of the Securities Act, none of the Certificates have been
or will be registered under the Securities Act, and, if in the
future the transferee decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise
transfer the Certificates, such Certificates may be offered,
resold, pledged or otherwise transferred solely in accordance with

access to such financial and other information concerning the
Issuer and the Certificates as it deemed necessary or appropriate
in order to make an informed investment decision with respect to
its purchase of the Certificates. The transferee has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that the
transferee is
 
10



capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of its investment in the Certificates, and the transferee and
any accounts for which it is acting are each able to bear the
economic risk of such investment;

(v) such transferee will not make
any general solicitation by means of general advertising or in any
other manner, or take any other action that would constitute a
distribution of the Certificates under the Securities Act or that
would render the disposition of the Certificates a violation of
Section 5 of the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws or require registration pursuant thereto, and will
not authorize any Person to act on its behalf, in such manner with
respect to the Certificates;

(vi) such transferee is not
acquiring the Certificates with a view to the resale, distribution
or other disposition thereof in violation of the Securities
Act;

(vii) such transferee will provide
notice to each Person to whom it proposes to transfer any interest
in the Certificates of the transfer restrictions and
representations set forth in this Agreement, including the Exhibits
hereto;

(viii) such transferee is not
acquiring such Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of
or with any assets of (i) a Benefit Plan, or (ii) any
governmental plan, non-U.S. plan, church plan or any other employee
benefit plan or arrangement that is subject to Similar
Law;

(ix) such transferee acknowledges
that the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Depositor, the Initial
Certificate Purchaser and others will rely upon the truth and
accuracy of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and

made by it in connection with its purchase of the Certificates are
no longer accurate, the transferee will promptly notify the Issuer,
the Owner Trustee and the Depositor; and

(x) such transferee acknowledges

(a) none of the Issuer, the Servicer, the Depositor, the
Initial Certificate Purchaser or the Owner Trustee is acting as a
fiduciary or financial or investment adviser for the transferee,
(b) the transferee is not relying (for purposes of making any
investment decision or otherwise) upon any advice, counsel or
representations (whether written or oral) of the Initial
Certificate Purchaser, the Issuer, the Servicer, the Depositor or
the Owner Trustee other than in the most current private placement
memorandum for such Certificates and any representations expressly
set forth in a written agreement with such party, (c) none of
the Initial Certificate Purchaser, the Issuer, the Servicer, the
Depositor or the Owner Trustee has given to the transferee
(directly or indirectly through any other Person, in any
documentation for the Certificates or otherwise) any assurance,
guarantee or representation whatsoever as to the expected or
projected success, profitability, return, performance, result,
effect, consequence or benefit (including legal, regulatory, tax,
financial, accounting or otherwise) of its
 
11



purchase of the Certificates,
(d) the transferee has consulted with its own legal,
regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial, and accounting
advisers to the extent it has deemed necessary and it has made its
own investment decisions (including decisions regarding the
suitability of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by this
Agreement) based upon its own judgment and upon any advice from
such advisers as it has deemed necessary and not upon any view
expressed by the Initial Certificate Purchaser, the Issuer, the
Servicer, the Depositor or the Owner Trustee, (e) the
transferee has determined that the rates, prices or amounts and
other terms of the purchase and sale of the applicable Certificates
reflect those in the relevant market for similar transactions,
(f) the transferee is purchasing the Certificates with a full
understanding of all of the terms, conditions and risks thereof
(economic and otherwise), and is capable of assuming and willing to
assume (financially and otherwise) these risks and (g) the
transferee is a sophisticated investor familiar with transactions
similar to its investment in the Certificates.

By accepting and holding a
Certificate (or any interest therein), the Holder, and any
fiduciary acting on behalf of a Holder, shall be deemed to have
represented and warranted that it is not, and is not purchasing the
Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of or with any
assets of, a Benefit Plan or any governmental, non-U.S., church or
any other employee benefit plan or retirement arrangement that is
subject to Similar Law. Subject to the transfer restrictions
contained herein and in the Certificates, any Certificateholder may
transfer all or any portion of the Percentage Interest evidenced by
such Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee
accompanied by the documents required by this Section. Such
transfer may be made by the registered Certificateholder in person
or by his attorney duly authorized in writing upon surrender of the
Certificate to the Owner Trustee accompanied by (a) a written
instrument of transfer in the form of the “Assignment”
attached to the Form of Certificate (attached hereto as Exhibit
A ) and with such signature guarantees and evidence of
authority of the Persons signing the instrument of transfer as the
Owner Trustee may reasonably require; provided, however, that the
Owner Trustee shall not require the signature of the Depositor to
be medallion guaranteed for the transfers from the Depositor to the
applicable transferees on the date hereof, (b) an executed
direction letter regarding registration of such transfer in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit D , (c) the documents
required by Section 3.7(c) and (d) a Certificate
Investor Representation Letter substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B . Promptly upon the receipt of such
documents and receipt by the Owner Trustee of the
transferor’s Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall record the
name of such transferee as a Certificateholder and its Percentage
Interest in the Certificate Register and issue, execute and deliver
to such Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such Percentage
Interest. In the event a transferor transfers only a portion of its
Percentage Interest, the Owner Trustee shall issue, execute and
deliver to such transferor a new Certificate evidencing such
transferor’s new Percentage Interest. Subsequent to a
transfer of a Percentage Interest and upon the related issuance of
the new Certificate or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel
and destroy the Certificate surrendered to it in connection with
such transfer. Unless otherwise provided in this
Section 3.7 or under applicable law, the Owner Trustee
may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered as
the sole owner of the beneficial interest in the Issuer evidenced
by such Certificate.
 
12



(b) As a condition precedent to any
registration of transfer under this Section 3.7 , the
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges
required to be paid in connection with such transfer.

(c) Each registered owner of and, if
different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate
that is a “United States person” (as defined in Code
section 7701(a)(30)) shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Administrator and the Certificate Paying Agent two properly
completed and duly executed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form W-9 (or applicable successor form) certifying that it
is not subject to backup withholding and that it is a U.S. person.
Each registered owner of and, if different, each owner of a
beneficial interest in, a Certificate that is not a “United
States person” shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Administrator and the Certificate Paying Agent two properly
completed and duly executed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8BEN (Certification of Foreign Status as Beneficial
Owner), U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E (Certificate of
Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Withholding and
Reporting (entities)), U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY
(Certification of Foreign Intermediary Status) or U.S. Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (Certification of Foreign
Person’s Claim for Exemption from Withholding on Income
Effectively Connected with Conduct of a U.S. Trade or Business), or
any applicable successors to such U.S. Internal Revenue Service
forms or other reasonable information or certification requested by
the Owner Trustee, the Administrator or the Certificate Paying
Agent (i) to permit the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and
the Certificate Paying Agent to make payments to the registered
owner of, and if different, each owner of a beneficial interest in,
a Certificate without withholding or deduction (including any FATCA
Withholding Tax), (ii) to enable the Issuer to qualify for a
reduced rate of withholding in any jurisdiction from or through
which the Issuer receives payments on its assets, or (iii) to
enable the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate
Paying Agent to satisfy any reporting or other obligations under
any applicable tax law (including FATCA), and will update or
replace such form, certification or other information as necessary
in accordance with its terms or its subsequent amendments. The
applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service forms and information
required to be delivered, as described above, shall be delivered on
or prior to the date on which a Certificateholder and, if
different, a Certificate Owner becomes a Certificateholder or
Certificate Owner under this Agreement and from time to time
thereafter as prescribed by applicable law or upon the request of
the Certificate Paying Agent.

(d) Each registered owner of, and,
if different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate
represents to the Issuer and Owner Trustee by acceptance of this
Certificate or interest therein that it is not and will not become
subject to any FATCA Withholding Tax.

(e) Each purchaser, beneficial owner
and subsequent transferee of Certificates or an interest therein
will be required or deemed to acknowledge that the Issuer may
provide such information and any other information concerning its
investment in the Certificates to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service. In addition, each purchaser, beneficial owner
and
 
13



subsequent transferee of
Certificates or an interest therein will be required or deemed to
understand and acknowledge that the Issuer has the right,
hereunder, to withhold on any beneficial owner of an interest in a
Certificate that fails to comply with the foregoing
requirements.

(f) No transfers shall be permitted
if such transfer is effected through an established securities
market or secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)
within the meaning of the Code Section 7704 and any proposed,
temporary or final Treasury regulations thereunder.

(g) Each Certificate shall bear a
legend in substantially the following form, unless the Depositor
determines otherwise in accordance with applicable law:

THIS CERTIFICATE OR ANY INTEREST
HEREIN HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED
STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES
ACT”) OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED
STATES, AND THE ISSUER HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED
STATES INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED (THE

BUYER WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (A
“QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER”) WHO IS EITHER
PURCHASING FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER IN A TRANSACTION MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF
RULE 144A OR (2) TO THE DEPOSITOR OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES AND
BY THE DEPOSITOR OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES AS PART OF THE INITIAL
DISTRIBUTION OR ANY REDISTRIBUTION OF THE CERTIFICATES BY THE
DEPOSITOR OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES AND (B) IN ACCORDANCE WITH
ALL APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES
AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE JURISDICTION. EACH PURCHASER WILL BE
DEEMED TO HAVE MADE CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS SET
FORTH IN THE TRUST AGREEMENT. ANY TRANSFER IN VIOLATION OF THE
FOREGOING WILL BE OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT, WILL BE VOID AB
INITIO , AND WILL NOT OPERATE TO TRANSFER ANY RIGHTS TO THE
TRANSFEREE, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY TO THE
ISSUER, THE OWNER TRUSTEE, OR ANY INTERMEDIARY. IF AT ANY TIME, THE
ISSUER DETERMINES OR IS NOTIFIED THAT THE HOLDER OF SUCH
CERTIFICATE OR PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN SUCH CERTIFICATE WAS IN
BREACH, AT THE TIME GIVEN, OF ANY OF THE REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH
IN THE TRUST AGREEMENT, THE ISSUER AND THE OWNER TRUSTEE MAY
CONSIDER THE ACQUISITION OF THIS CERTIFICATE OR SUCH INTEREST IN
SUCH CERTIFICATE VOID AND REQUIRE THAT THIS CERTIFICATE OR SUCH
INTEREST HEREIN BE TRANSFERRED TO A PERSON DESIGNATED BY THE
ISSUER.

BY ACQUIRING THIS CERTIFICATE, EACH
PURCHASER AND TRANSFEREE, AND ANY FIDUCIARY ACTING ON BEHALF OF A
PURCHASER OR TRANSFEREE, WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT AND WARRANT
THAT IT IS NOT ACQUIRING
 
14


THIS CERTIFICATE (OR ANY INTEREST HEREIN) ON
BEHALF OF OR WITH ANY ASSETS OF (I) AN “EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLAN” AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(3) OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT
INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED (“ERISA”),
WHICH IS SUBJECT TO TITLE I OF ERISA, (II) A “PLAN” AS
DESCRIBED BY SECTION 4975(e)(1) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF
1986, AS AMENDED (THE “CODE”), WHICH IS SUBJECT TO
SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE, (III) ANY ENTITY DEEMED TO HOLD THE PLAN
ASSETS OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING BY REASON OF SUCH EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLAN’S OR PLAN’S INVESTMENT IN THE ENTITY, OR (IV) ANY
GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH, NON-U.S. OR OTHER PLAN THAT IS SUBJECT TO ANY
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. LAW THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR
TO TITLE I OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE.

(h) If a Responsible Officer of the
Owner Trustee has actual knowledge that (1) a transfer or
attempted or purported transfer of any Certificate or interest
therein was consummated in compliance with the provisions of this
Section 3.7 on the basis of a materially incorrect
certification from the transferor or purported transferee,
(2) a transferee of a Definitive Certificate failed to deliver
to the Owner Trustee a Certificate Investor Representation Letter
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto or
(3) the Certificateholder of any Certificate or interest
therein is in material breach of any representation or agreement
set forth in any Certificate or any deemed representation or
agreement of such Certificateholder, the Owner Trustee will direct
the Certificate Registrar not to register such attempted or
purported transfer and, if a transfer has been registered, such
transfer shall be absolutely null and void ab initio and shall not
operate to transfer any rights to the purported transferee (such
purported transferee, a “ Disqualified Transferee
”) and the last preceding Certificateholder of such
Certificateholder that was not a Disqualified Transferee shall be
restored to all rights as a Certificateholder thereof retroactively
to the date of the purported transfer of such Certificate by such
Certificateholder.

(i) After the Closing Date, a
Certificate (or beneficial interest therein) may not be sold or
transferred to a Person that beneficially owns a Note (or interest
therein) if such sale or transfer will result in such Person
beneficially owning more than 99% of the Certificates of the Issuer
(and any other interest in the Issuer treated as equity for United
States federal income tax purposes).

(j) Unless the Depositor has
received an opinion from a nationally recognized tax counsel that
the restriction on the proposed acquisition of a Certificate (or
interest therein) described by this paragraph is no longer
necessary to conclude that any such acquisition (and subsequent
resale of the applicable Notes described below) will not cause the
Treasury Regulations under Code section 385 to apply to the
applicable Notes described below in a manner that could cause a
material adverse effect on the Issuer or the Issuer to be treated
as other than a grantor trust under subtitle A, chapter 1,
subchapter J, part I, subpart E of the Code, (A) a
Section 385 Certificateholder cannot acquire a Certificate (or
interest therein) if (i) a member of any “expanded
group” (as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.385-1(c)(4)) that includes the Section 385
Certificateholder owns any Notes or (ii) a Section 385
Controlled Partnership of such expanded group owns any Notes and
(B) a Section 385 Certificateholder cannot hold
a
 
15



Certificate (or interest therein) if
(i) a member of any “expanded group” (as defined
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.385-1(c)(4)) that includes
the Section 385 Certificateholder acquires any Notes from the
Issuer, any Affiliate, or through the marketplace or (ii) a
Section 385 Controlled Partnership of such expanded group
acquires any Notes from the Issuer, any Affiliate, or through the
marketplace. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the holder
or potential holder of the applicable Notes is a U.S. corporate
member of the same U.S. corporate affiliated group (as defined in
Section 1504 of the Code) filing a consolidated federal income
tax return that includes each of any applicable related
Section 385 Certificateholders (including in the case of a
partnership, the relevant “expanded group partner” (as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.385-3(g)(12)). If a
Certificateholder (or Certificate Owner) fails to comply with the
requirements of this paragraph, the Issuer or Depositor are
authorized, at its discretion, to compel such Certificateholder (or
Certificate Owner) to sell its Certificate (or interest therein) to
a Person whose ownership does not result in a failure to comply
with this paragraph.

SECTION 3.8. Lost, Stolen,
Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates . If (i) any mutilated
Certificate is surrendered to the Owner Trustee, or (ii) the
Owner Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction that any
Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of
ownership satisfactory to the Owner Trustee together with such
security or indemnity as may be requested by the Owner Trustee to
save it and the Issuer harmless, the Owner Trustee shall execute
and deliver a new Certificate for the same Percentage Interest as
the Certificate so mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, of like
tenor and bearing a different issue number, with such notations, if
any, as the Owner Trustee shall determine. Upon the issuance of any
new Certificate under this Section 3.8 , the Issuer or
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
connection with any transfer or exchange of the Certificate and any
other reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of the Issuer and the Owner Trustee) connected therewith.
Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this
Section 3.8 shall constitute complete and indefeasible
evidence of ownership in the Issuer, as if originally issued,
whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be
found at any time. The provisions of this Section 3.8
are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other
rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificates.

SECTION 3.9. Appointment of the
Certificate Paying Agent . To the extent Definitive
Certificates have been issued, the Certificate Paying Agent shall
make distributions to Certificateholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.1 and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee and
the Servicer; provided , however , that no such
reports shall be required so long as the Depositor or an affiliate
of the Depositor is the sole Certificateholder. Any Certificate
Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from
the Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making the
distributions referred to above. The Issuer may revoke such power
and remove the Certificate Paying Agent if the Issuer determines in
its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent shall have
failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect. The Certificate Paying Agent shall initially be
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and any co-paying agent
chosen by the Certificate Paying Agent. Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association shall be permitted to resign as Certificate Paying
Agent upon thirty (30) days’ written notice
to
 
16


the Administrator. If Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association shall no longer be the Certificate Paying Agent or the
Administrator shall appoint a successor to act as Certificate
Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). The
Administrator shall cause such successor Certificate Paying Agent
or any additional Certificate Paying Agent appointed by the
Administrator to execute and deliver a written agreement in which
such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate
Paying Agent shall agree with the Issuer that, as Certificate
Paying Agent, such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional
Certificate Paying Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held by it
for payment to the Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of
the Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be
paid to such Certificateholders. Subject to applicable laws with
respect to the escheat of funds, the Certificate Paying Agent shall
return all funds that have remained unclaimed by a
Certificateholder for two years to the Owner Trustee and, upon
removal of a Certificate Paying Agent, such Certificate Paying
Agent shall also return all funds (including any unclaimed funds)
in its possession to the Owner Trustee. The rights, protections,
indemnities and immunities of the Indenture Trustee under the
Indenture and the Sale and Servicing Agreement shall apply to Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association also in its role as Certificate
Paying Agent or Certificate Registrar for so long as Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association shall act as Certificate Paying Agent or
Certificate Registrar and, to the extent applicable, to any other
paying agent, certificate registrar or authenticating agent
appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the
Certificate Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless
the context requires otherwise.

SECTION 3.10. Maintenance of
Office or Agency . As long as any of the Certificates remain
outstanding, the Issuer shall maintain an office or agency where
Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in
respect of the Certificates and this Agreement may be served. The
Issuer hereby initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of
the Certificate Registrar for the foregoing purposes. The Issuer
shall give prompt written notice to the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee of the location, and of any change in the
location, of any such office or agency. If at any time the Issuer
shall fail to maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to
furnish the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee with the
address thereof, such surrenders, notices and demands may be made
or served at the applicable Corporate Trust Office, and the Issuer
hereby appoints the Owner Trustee as its agent to receive all such
surrenders, notices and demands.
