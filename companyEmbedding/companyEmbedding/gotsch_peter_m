Throughout his tenure, he has provided expert advice and counsel to management and our Board on every type of issue confronting modern corporate boards. As Beacon's first Lead Independent Director, Peter has provided important perspective to the Board on governance and has been instrumental in Beacon's evaluation of acquisitions and the implementation of our growth strategy. Our employees and shareholders have benefitted greatly from his expertise and passion for Beacon's success and our entire Board of Directors will miss his participation in our future meetings."  Mr. Gotsch added: "I have enjoyed serving on Beacon's Board of Directors and to have played a role in Beacon's growth and success. Beacon has dedicated and hardworking employees and great leadership, both at the management and Board levels. I will miss participating in future Board meetings but look forward to watching Beacon continue to grow, lead the industry consolidation and add shareholder value for many years to come."
