Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.

AN era in advertising will end Dec. 31 when Edward H. Meyer — known as the Rupert Murdoch or Sumner Redstone of Madison Avenue — plans to do something that neither media mogul has done: retire.For 36 years, Mr. Meyer, who is 79, has led the worldwide agency now known as the Grey Global Group. When he sold it last year to the WPP Group for $1.75 billion, his payday was estimated at close to $500 million.As part of the deal to sell Grey Global, Mr. Meyer agreed to give up his posts as chairman and chief executive of the Grey Worldwide division by September 2005. Then, 15 months later, he was to give up his duties as chairman and chief executive of Grey Global.Mr. Meyer ceded his Grey Worldwide duties on schedule last year, hiring James R. Heekin from Euro RSCG Worldwide, part of Havas. Still, in an industry filled with people who have never known anyone other than Mr. Meyer at the helm of Grey Global, many were convinced that he would figure out some way to stay.

Mr. Meyer, who turns 80 next month, is well known for his  ability to keep a steely grip on power, controlling Grey Global’s destiny for three decades while building it into one of the world’s biggest — and most profitable — agencies. Continue reading the main story

But now, even Mr. Meyer concedes it is time for him to go, a decision Grey Global intends to announce formally today  along with details of succession plans.“A couple of years ago, I realized I was not immortal,” Mr. Meyer, who joined Grey in 1956 in the account service department, said in an interview. “I realized I ought to preserve the business I developed, and develop a second life.” Mr. Meyer was referring to his decision in early 2004 to put Grey Global up for sale. The process ended with its acquisition by WPP, the world’s second-largest agency company after the Omnicom Group, which added Grey Global to blue-chip agencies like JWT, Ogilvy & Mather and Y&R.•“Ed’s been at it 50 years,” Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, said in an interview, comparing Mr. Meyer’s track record at Grey Global with the achievements of splashier agencies that are only “5 years, 10 years old.”“The test is over time,” Mr. Sorrell said, adding: “It’s not a 100-meter dash. It’s a marathon. He has built an integrated operation with very big clients: Procter & Gamble, Nokia, GlaxoSmithKline. It’s not short term and sexy, it’s long term and powerful.”“If I had been there 50 years ago, would I have done it necessarily the same way?” Mr. Sorrell asked rhetorically, referring to Mr. Meyer’s model of centralizing operations.“Maybe not,” he continued. “But the results speak for themselves: Grey, Grey Health Care, G2, GCI, MediaCom, Wing Latino.” Those are among the principal divisions of Grey Global, which handle tasks in addition to advertising that include digital marketing, media planning and buying, design and marketing aimed at Hispanic consumers.Mr. Meyer acknowledged that he had faced vociferous critics of the way he ran Grey Global.“I built my career and the agency on the belief clients come first, and the job of the guy at the head of the agency is to know their needs,” Mr. Meyer said. “Not what they like for dinner, but their advertising needs, better than anyone at the agency.

“I built auxiliary services here like direct marketing not because I’m a genius, but because I got an early alert; I heard my clients talking about them,” he added. “If I waited for the guy or gal running the account to get that information to me, it’d be a year later.”Comparing himself with some other chief executives in the 1970s through the 1990s, Mr. Meyer said: “I was one of the few guys who owned a big hunk of the agency he ran. Every penny I had was in here, so I had more at stake than anyone else.”“I sweated it harder; I overruled people because I couldn’t afford to be a nice guy.”Mr. Meyer said he noticed contradictions among the complaints. “I used to get criticism because there was so little turnover, and yet I was called a ‘benevolent dictator’ who was harsh on people,” he said. “If I was, why didn’t they leave?”Now, however, Mr. Meyer is taking a more mellow view.“I’ve had a 50-year run and I had the opportunity to wake up one day and say, ‘It’s been enough,’ ” he said, joking that he did not think he had “another 50 years in me.”

As of Jan. 1, Mr. Heekin, 57, is to take over for Mr. Meyer as chairman and chief executive of Grey Global while remaining chairman and chief executive of Grey Worldwide.“It’s a big baton,” Mr. Heekin said of the passing of Mr. Meyer’s Grey Global duties to him, adding that his principal goal would be to accelerate the evolution of the agency “from an account-management-driven, advertising-focused legacy, which served us very well, into a creatively driven, total communications company.”“Grey is an agency that needs to change; all agencies need to change,” Mr. Heekin said, particularly “when you’ve had single-minded management for the last 30 years.”Even so, “18 of our 20 top clients grew with us in the past year,” he added, referring to additional assignments from accounts like Darden Restaurants, Diageo, Nokia and Novartis.To signal a desire to end the days of Grey Global as a “one-man band,” as Mr. Heekin put it, he is reorganizing the senior management to help “pull together the resources we have to make this into one company,” he said, “with one vision and one go-to-market strategy.”

Joe Celia, 47, chairman and chief executive of G2, which oversees tasks like new media, direct marketing and design, will also serve as a vice chairman of Grey Global.Tim Mellors, 59, president and chief creative officer for the North American operations of Grey Worldwide, will be promoted to vice chairman and chief creative officer at Grey Global.•Mr. Heekin said: “There are three of us at the top who will share equally the challenge and responsibility” of running Grey Global. “It’s a huge change.”Mr. Sorrell said he was delighted at the performance of Grey Global since the acquisition and at the “very smooth transition” from Mr. Meyer to Mr. Heekin at Grey Worldwide.Among his goals for Grey Global under the new leadership, Mr. Sorrell said he hoped the agency would work more closely with other parts of WPP, further develop its operations in fast-growing regions like Asia and Latin America and “develop the digital side even more.”As for Mr. Meyer, he said that after he retired he intended to open a small investment boutique with his son, Tony, and “finally get to spend real time” with the charitable and cultural organizations he has supported financially.For instance, Mr. Meyer, who has been on the board of the Guggenheim Museum, is becoming its treasurer.As for the industry in which he spent five decades, Mr. Meyer said, “I’ll probably keep a subscription to Advertising Age and have lunch with some of my old pals in the business.“That’s about the size of it,” he added. “The time has now come to an end.”

Seller's Description
New in New jacket. Lang: -eng, Pages 60. It is the reprint edition of the original edition which was published long back. The book is printed in black on high quality paper with Matt Laminated colored dust cover. We found this book important for the readers who want to know more about our old treasure so we brought it back to the shelves. We tried to manage the best possible copy but in some cases, there may be some pages which are blur or missing or with black spots. We expect that you will understand our compulsion in these books. Print on Demand.

History Books

Whether it happened last month or centuries ago, it's history, and our stellar supply of History Books can guide you through the entirety of human experience. From the regal to the ridiculous, the obscure to the unavoidable, you'll uncover information about any piece of the past that strikes your fancy. Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States? Check. Stephen Ambrose's Undaunted Courage? All yours. Elie Wiesel's Night? Right here. You can probably even read about the history of history books if you want.




1776: America and Britain at War
Relive America's first flush of freedom. History buffs will wet their pants at the unprecedented amount of revelatory info heavyweight historian David McCullough provides here about the year the U.S. claimed its independence from England. But anyone intrigued with the way human passions and politics interact will find themselves fascinated when 1776 really digs deep and lets you know what it was like to be around for the Revolutionary War.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
