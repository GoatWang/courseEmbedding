VAN KAMPEN FOCUS PORTFOLIOS (SM)
 A DIVISION OF VAN KAMPEN FUNDS INC.
 INSURED INCOME TRUST, SERIES 92

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 invests in a  
portfolio of long-term bonds. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current
income and to preserve capital. The Trust is a unit investment trust included in
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7.                           

                                          Monthly                Semi-Annual

                                       -------------            ------------
    Estimated Current Return:           6.03%                    6.07%
    Estimated Long Term Return:         6.01%                    6.05%
       CUSIP:                           92114K-50-1 92114K-51-9

Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each 
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated  
return over the estimated life of your Trust. We base this estimate on an       
average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This estimate also        
reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the average yield   
for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value and estimated    
life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return accounts for  
maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates show a         
comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation can       
predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these estimates.   

 PROSPECTUS PART I
 MAY 1, 2002

 This prospectus contains two parts.

 No one may use this Prospectus Part I unless accompanied by Prospectus Part II.

 YOU SHOULD READ THIS PROSPECTUS AND RETAIN IT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of

(1)  Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This  
could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot    
   guarantee that the value of your units will equal the principal amount of
bonds per unit when you redeem them or when your trust terminates.    

(2)  After the first settlement date (May 6, 2002), you will pay accrued        
interest from this date to your settlement date less interest         
distributions.                                                        

(3)  We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.  

(4)  This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than insurance       
expenses. Estimated expenses are expected to fluctuate periodically.  

(5)  Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your    
   Trust assesses other fees per Unit. (6) During the first year the Trustee
    will reduce its fee by approximately $.19 per Unit (which is the estimated
   interest to be earned prior to the expected delivery dates for the "when,
    as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" bonds). Should the interest exceed
  this amount, the Trustee will reduce its fee up to its annual fee. After
the first year, the Trustee's fee will be the amount indicated above. 
    Estimated interest income will increase to $62.62. Estimated expenses will
    increase to $2.32 and $1.92 under the monthly and semi-annual distribution
  plans, respectively. Estimated net interest income will remain as shown.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO 

(1) The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for   
  the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
   affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
   acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from January 23, 2002
to April 30, 2002.                                                      

(2) Other information regarding the bonds is as follows:                        

         COST TO           PROFIT (LOSS)
       SPONSOR            TO SPONSOR
      ---------------      ---------------
$    8,832,176        $     77,778

The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate   
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the   
   corresponding gain or loss is included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked
  by "##" following the maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and
if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins  
accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of     
delivery. Delivery is expected to take place at various dates after the 
first settlement date.                                                  

"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an   
  original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part
II. The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is     
described in "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.                

(3) All ratings are by Standard & Poor's unless otherwise indicated. "*"        
   indicates that the rating of the bond is by Moody's. "o" indicates that the
rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating agency of a policy of   
insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. "NR" indicates that the  
rating service did not provide a rating for that bond. For a brief      
  description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the Information
Supplement.                                                             

(4) This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and  
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at     
 declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
    issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price
    plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus,
   if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an
  issue of bonds. Certain bonds may be subject to redemption without premium
prior to the date shown pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory 
redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in  
Prospectus Part II.                                                     

UNDERWRITING. The Underwriters named below have purchased Units in the
following amounts from the Sponsor. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and
Underwriter Compensation" in Prospectus Part II.

REPORT OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Unitholders of
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus   
Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7):                                           

  We have audited the accompanying statement of condition and the portfolio of
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus   
Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7) as of May 1, 2002. The statement of        
condition and portfolio are the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our              
responsibility is to express an opinion on such financial statements based on   
our audit.                                                                      

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally    
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan  
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of an irrevocable letter of    
credit deposited to purchase bonds by correspondence with the Trustee. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement      
presentation. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Van Kampen Focus Portfolios    
Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income    
Series 7) as of May 1, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.

 TAXABLE INCOME SERIES 7

 This prospectus contains two parts.

 No one may use this Prospectus Part II unless accompanied by Prospectus Part I.

YOU SHOULD READ THIS PROSPECTUS AND RETAIN IT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of
the Trust Units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus.     

Any contrary representation is a criminal offense.

THE TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. Your Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York
pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the  
date of this prospectus (the "Date of Deposit") among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as 
Sponsor, J.J. Kenny & Co., Inc., as Evaluator, Van Kampen Investment Advisory   
Corp., as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York, as Trustee.                     

Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to   
participate in a portfolio of taxable bonds with greater diversification than   
they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's assets 
will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds.  
For a breakdown of your Trust's portfolio, see "Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I.
In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a Trust  
are often not available in small amounts and may, in the case of any privately  
placed bonds, be available only to institutional investors.                     

On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the    
aggregate principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I. The bonds initially consist of     
delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash     
equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial          
institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, delivered to   
the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the number of Units indicated under        
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I. A Trust that 
holds primarily long-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I,
is referred to herein as a "Long-Term Trust". A Trust that holds primarily      
intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is     
referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". A Trust that holds only     
insured bonds are referred to herein as "Insured Trusts". Unless otherwise      
terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will terminate at the end of 
the calender year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of its execution in the case
of a Long-Term Trust and at the end of the calender year prior to the twentieth 
anniversary of its execution in the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust.         

   Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in
the principal and net income of the Trust. To the extent that any Units are     
redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in the Trust         
represented by each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the     
Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by    
Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust Agreement.                    

OBJECTIVE AND BOND SELECTION. The objective of a Long-Term Trust is to
provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally     
selected portfolio primarily consisting of long-term bonds. The objective of an 
Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by     
investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of        
intermediate-term bonds. There is, of course, no guarantee that a Trust will    
achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for  
investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with   
greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.        

 In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following
factors, among others: (a) either the Standard & Poor's rating of the bonds was 
not less than "BBB-", or the Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating 
of the bonds was not less than "Baa3", including provisional or conditional     
ratings, respectively, (or, if not rated, the bonds had credit characteristics  
sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of interest-bearing bonds    
that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a Trust in the opinion
of the Sponsor), (b) the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of         
comparable quality and maturity, (c) the diversification of bonds as to purpose 
of issue and location of issuer and (d) with respect to the Insured Trusts, the 
availability and cost of insurance. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease 
to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the   
Date of Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but  
may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct 
the Trustee to dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio
Administration"). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in an Investment Grade
Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or "Baa3") during 
the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. See "The
Trusts--Risk Factors".                                                          

   Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and
interest on the bonds in an Insured Trust has been obtained from a bond         
insurance company. For information relating to insurance on the bonds, see      
"Insurance on the Bonds in an Insured Trust". Neither the Public Offering Price 
nor any evaluation of Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects 
any element of value for the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust unless bonds
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of    
such default. See "Public Offering--Offering Price".                            

In order for bonds to be eligible for insurance, they must have credit
characteristics which would qualify them for at least the Standard & Poor's     
rating of "BBB-" or at least the Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating of      
"Baa3", which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment
grade (see "Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement). Insurance is
not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer, but supplements the existing
credit and provides additional security. If an issue is accepted for insurance, 
a non-cancellable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the
bonds, when due, is issued by the insurer. A monthly premium is paid by a Trust 
for the insurance obtained by it. The Trustee has the right to obtain permanent 
insurance from a Portfolio Insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured
under the insurance policy obtained from the respective Portfolio Insurer by an 
Insured Trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from 
the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust
is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. All bonds insured by a Portfolio    
Insurer or by a Preinsured Bond Insurer receive a "AAA" rating by Standard &    
Poor's. Standard & Poor's describes securities it rates "AAA" as having "the    
highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to  
pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong." See "Insurance on the
Bonds in an Insured Trust".                                                     

RISK FACTORS. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand   
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of    
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one   
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a  
more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment.                   

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if   
interest rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise 
and rise in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before    
maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes.                     

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet
its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                        

    Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original 
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to 
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to  
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less   
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par   
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your 
Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate     
early. The first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is    
listed in Prospectus Part I along with the price the issuer would have to pay.  

  Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating. Bond concentration risk is the risk that    
your Trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of  
bond. When a certain type of bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is 
considered to be "concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are 
described in the following sections.                                            

Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become  
smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

     Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market
will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the              
over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).         

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or 
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an 
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.                          

   MORE ABOUT THE BONDS. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds,
other information about the bonds is also listed in the "Portfolio" in          
Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the     
bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.            

    Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.         

   Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds
do not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par
value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during     
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

"When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are   
actually issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust
"when, as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be 
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to    
your Trust until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to    
adjust your tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the      
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued      
between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your 
Trust. This could lower your first year estimated current return. You may       
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even 
though your Trust has not yet received them.                                    

     NO FDIC GUARANTEE. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

ESTIMATED CURRENT                                                               
AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Estimated Current Returns and the Estimated Long-Term Returns as of the
Date of Deposit are set forth on the cover of Prospectus Part I. Estimated      
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest      
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest 
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your Trust and   
with the principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds. 
The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.     
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Current Return    
will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a
formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the   
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the 
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales      
charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated retirements of the  
bonds and the expenses of your Trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the future. The Estimated
Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the
calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount
of principal returned while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes   
only net annual interest income and Public Offering Price.                      

   In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the
First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary  
to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from     
interest payments on the related bonds.                                         

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial
offering period the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate offering    
price of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the      
Principal Account and accrued interest, if any. The sales charge for an         
Intermediate-Term Trust is equal to 3.0% of the public offering price per Unit  
(3.093% of the aggregate offering price of the bonds) and the sales charge for a
Long-Term Trust is equal to 4.9% of the public offering price per Unit (5.152%  
of the aggregate offering price of the bonds). After the initial public offering
period, the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of
the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the Principal     
Account and accrued interest, if any. The minimum purchase in the primary and   
secondary market is one Unit. In connection with fully disclosed transactions   
with the Sponsor, the minimum purchase is the number of Units stated in the     
contract between the Sponsor and the related broker or agent.                   

The sales charge applicable to quantity purchases during the initial  
offering period is reduced as follows:

   * The breakpoint sales charges are also applied on a dollar basis utilizing a
breakpoint equivalent in the above table of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied 
on whichever basis is more favorable to the investor. The breakpoints will be   
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which     
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be  
issued.                                                                         

     The secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following
table based upon the estimated long-term return life of your Trust's portfolio:

   For purposes of computation of the estimated long-term return life, bonds
will be deemed to mature on their expressed maturity dates unless: (a) the bonds
have been called for redemption or are subject to redemption at an earlier call 
date, in which case this call date will be deemed to be the maturity date; or   
(b) the bonds are subject to a "mandatory tender", in which case the mandatory  
tender will be deemed to be the maturity date. The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds.   
Expressed as a percent of the Public Offering Price, the sales charge on a Trust
consisting entirely of bonds with 15 years to maturity would be 4.80%.          

    Any reduced sales charge is the responsibility of the selling Underwriter,
broker, dealer or agent. The Sponsor will, however, increase the concession or  
agency commission for quantity purchases.                                       

The reduced sales charge for quantity purchases, during the initial   
offering period table above will apply on all purchases by the same person from 
any one Underwriter or dealer of units of Van Kampen unit investment trusts     
which are being offered in the initial offering period (a) on any one day (the  
"Initial Purchase Date") or (b) on any day subsequent to the Initial Purchase   
Date, if the units purchased are of a unit investment trust purchased on the    
Initial Purchase Date. In the event units of more than one trust are purchased  
on the Initial Purchase Date, the aggregate dollar amount of such purchases will
be used to determine whether purchasers are eligible for a reduced sales charge.
Such aggregate dollar amount will be divided by the public offering price per   
unit (on the day preceding the date of purchase) of each respective trust       
purchased to determine the total number of units which such amount could have   
purchased of each individual trust. Purchasers must then consult the applicable 
trust's prospectus to determine whether the total number of units which could   
have been purchased of a specific trust would have qualified for a reduced sales
charge and, if so qualified, the amount of such reduction. Assuming a purchaser 
qualifies for a sales charge reduction or reductions, to determine the          
applicable sales charge reduction or reductions it is necessary to accumulate   
all purchases made on the Initial Purchase Date and all purchases made in       
accordance with (b) above. Units purchased in the name of the spouse of a       
purchaser or in the name of a child of such purchaser ("immediate family        
members") will be deemed for the purposes of calculating the applicable sales   
charge to be additional purchases by the purchaser. The reduced sales charges   
will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for one
or more trust, estate or fiduciary accounts. If you purchased Units on more than
one day to achieve the discounts described in this paragraph, the discount      
allowed on any single day will apply only to Units purchased on that day (a     
retroactive discount is not given on all prior purchases).                      

     For purposes of calculating the reduced sales charge for quantity purchases
in the table above, purchasers who have indicated their intent to purchase a    
specified amount of Units of any Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income    
Series or Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal Series unit investment trust   
during the initial offering period by executing and delivering a letter of      
intent to the Sponsor, which letter of intent must be in a form acceptable to   
the Sponsor and shall have a maximum duration of thirteen months, will be       
eligible to receive a reduced sales charge according to the tables above based  
on the amount of intended aggregate purchases as expressed in the letter of     
intent. By establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder agrees that the first  
purchase of Units following the execution of such letter of intent will be at   
least 5% of the total amount of the intended aggregate purchases expressed in   
the Unitholder's letter of intent. Further, through the establishment of the    
letter of intent, the Unitholder agrees that Units representing 5% of the total 
amount of the intended purchases will be held in escrow by the Trustee pending  
completion of these purchases. All distributions on Units held in escrow will be
credited to the Unitholder's account. If total purchases prior to the expiration
of the letter of intent period equal or exceed the amount specified in a        
Unitholder's letter of intent, the Units held in escrow will be transferred to  
the Unitholder's account. A Unitholder who purchases Units during the letter of 
intent period in excess of the number of Units specified in a Unitholder's      
letter of intent, the amount of which would cause the Unitholder to be eligible 
to receive an additional sales charge reduction, will be allowed such additional
sales charge reduction on the purchase of Units which caused the Unitholder to  
reach such new breakpoint level and on all additional purchases of Units during 
the letter of intent period. If the total purchases are less than the amount    
specified, the Unitholder involved must pay the Sponsor an amount equal to the  
difference between the amounts paid for these purchases and the amounts which   
would have been paid if the higher sales charge had been applied; the Unitholder
will, however, be entitled to any reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching
any lower breakpoint level. If the Unitholder does not pay the additional amount
within 20 days after written request by the Sponsor or the Unitholder's         
securities representative, the Sponsor will instruct the Trustee to redeem an   
appropriate number of the escrowed Units to meet the required payment. By       
establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder irrevocably appoints the Sponsor  
as attorney to give instructions to redeem any or all of the Unitholder's       
escrowed Units, with full power of substitution in the premises. A Unitholder or
his securities representative must notify the Sponsor whenever the Unitholder   
makes a purchase of Units that he wishes to be counted towards the intended     
amount.                                                                         

During the initial offering period of a Trust, unitholders of any Van 
Kampen-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit     
investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such
a trust to purchase Units of a Trust at a reduced sales charge. The reduced     
sales charge will be equal to the lesser of $35 per Unit or 3.50% of the Public 
Offering Price per Unit for a Long-Term Trust and will be equal to the lesser of
$25 or 2.50% of the Public Offering Price per Unit for an Intermediate Term     
Trust.                                                                          

Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses, children, 
grandchildren, parents, grandparents, siblings, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, 
sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for   
the benefit of such persons (collectively referred to herein as "related        
purchasers")) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates and Underwriters and  
their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the       
applicable underwriting commission or less the applicable dealer concession in  
the absence of an underwriting commission. Employees, officers and directors    
(including related purchasers) of dealers and their affiliates and vendors      
providing services to the Sponsor may purchase Units at the Public Offering     
Price less the applicable dealer concession.                                    

    Purchasers of units of any two consecutive series of a Trust may aggregate
purchases of units of such series for purposes of the sales charge reduction for
quantity purchases, provided that at the time of the initial purchase of units  
such purchaser submitted a purchase order for at least 100 units that was       
partially unfulfilled due to a lack of units of such Trust series available for 
sale at such time. The sales charge reduction shall be applied to the subsequent
purchase of units such that the aggregate sales charge reduction applicable to  
both purchases will equal the amount described in the initial offering period   
sales charge table above.                                                       

   A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in
this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of  
the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the section   
called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these purchases. Units may  
be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the Public Offering Price    
(for purchases which do not qualify for a sales charge reduction for quantity   
purchases) less the concession the Sponsor typically allows to brokers and      
dealers for purchases by (1) investors who purchase Units through registered    
investment advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers 
who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial  
planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such     
services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which
a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge is imposed, (2) bank trust departments        
investing funds over which they exercise exclusive discretionary investment     
authority and that are held in a fiduciary, agency, custodial or similar        
capacity, (3) any person who for at least 90 days, has been an officer, director
or bona fide employee of any firm offering Units for sale to investors or their 
immediate family members (as described above) and (4) officers and directors of 
bank holding companies that make Units available directly or through            
subsidiaries or bank affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in    
this prospectus, such investors, bank trust departments, firm employees and bank
holding company officers and directors who purchase Units through this program  
will not receive sales charge reductions for quantity purchases.                

OFFERING PRICE. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the 
amounts stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus 
Part I in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of 
Units on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales      
charge to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the 
number of Units outstanding. This price determination was made on the basis of  
an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the Evaluator. During the initial        
offering period, the Evaluator will value the bonds as of the Evaluation Time on
days the New York Stock Exchange is open for business and will adjust the Public
Offering Price of Units accordingly. This Public Offering Price will be         
effective for all orders received at or prior to the Evaluation Time on each    
such day. The "Evaluation Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock   
Exchange on each day that the Exchange is open for trading. Orders received by  
the Trustee, Sponsor or any Underwriter for purchases, sales or redemptions     
after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is closed, will be
held until the next determination of price. The secondary market Public Offering
Price per Unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the   
applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of  
Units outstanding. For secondary market purposes, this computation will be made 
by the Evaluator as of the Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is    
tendered for redemption and as necessary. The offering price of bonds may be    
expected to average approximately 0.35-1% more than the bid price.              

   The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices
or offering prices, as is appropriate, (a) on the basis of current market prices
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to    
those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are not available, on the basis of
current market prices for comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the     
bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting 
or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market  
prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest    
rates. Unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in    
significant risk of default, the Evaluator will not attribute any value to the  
insurance obtained by your Trust.                                               

     The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant
risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance guaranteeing 
interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will be equal to the
difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise
of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premiums and     
related expenses attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii)  
the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In      
addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of a Portfolio Insurer to meet
its commitments under any insurance policy, including commitments to issue      
Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by your   
Trust, if any, as of the date of this prospectus.                               

    A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

     ACCRUED INTEREST. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although your Trust accrues   
interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount of interest    
earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with respect to   
sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate share of      
accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering Price of
Units. Unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their    
Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest
which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount 
of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First  
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account     
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates  
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the    
amount of interest actually received by your Trust and distributed to           
Unitholders. If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he 
will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from
the purchaser of his Units.                                                     

UNIT DISTRIBUTION. Units will be distributed to the public by Underwriters,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.  
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. During the 
initial offering period, the Sponsor and Underwriters will sell Units to        
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price  
(net of any sales charge discount) less the concession or agency commission     
shown in the following tables.

1,000 Units or more               20                --                        

 Non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other selling agents who purchase an
aggregate of 250 or more Units directly from the Sponsor during the initial     
offering period will receive a net concession equal to the net concession       
allowed to Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation"  
below. For individual transactions of less than 250 Units, the Sponsor will     
offer a rebate per Unit equal to the Volume Concession Rebate described in the  
tables above so that the broker-dealer or selling agent receives the appropriate
net concession or agency commission. The Sponsor will pay this rebate after the 
end of the initial offering period.                                             

    Included in the concessions and agency commissions described in the tables
are volume concessions or agency commissions of an additional $5.00 per Unit for
any broker/dealer or agent (other than Underwriters) who purchases from the     
Sponsor at least 250 Units of a Trust during the initial offering period. These 
additional concessions will be allowed at the time of purchase, provided,       
however, the additional concession applicable to initial purchases totaling less
than 250 Units will be paid retroactively at the end of the initial offering    
period. The breakpoint concessions or agency commissions are also applied on a  
dollar basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be   
applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the distributor. The breakpoints
will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars   
which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole     
Units be issued.                                                                

 For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other
unit investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to      
purchase Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed  
to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $25 per Unit for a        
Long-Term Trust and $17.50 per Unit for an Intermediate Term Trust.             

In addition to the concession or agency commission and the volume     
concession rebate set forth in the tables above, all broker-dealers and other   
selling firms will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total
initial offering period sales of all Van Kampen unit investment trusts during a 
Quarterly Period as set forth in the following table:

  "Quarterly Period" means the following periods: December - February; March -
May; June - August; and September - November. Broker-dealers and other selling  
firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale of (1)   
units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge (as defined in      
appplicable prospectuses) or (2) units of Van Kampen unit investment trusts     
initially offered prior to December 17, 2001, however, such sales will be       
included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints set  
forth in the table above. Secondary market sales of all unit investment trusts  
are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions. The Sponsor will pay     
these amounts out of its own assets within a reasonable time following each     
Quarterly Period.                                                               

   Certain commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers
on an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal
to the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the   
banks. Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or
agent. For secondary market transactions, the concession or agency commission   
will amount to 70% of the applicable sales charge. The Sponsor reserves the     
right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the purchase of Units and to
change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others  
from time to time.                                                              

SPONSOR AND UNDERWRITER COMPENSATION. The Sponsor will sell Units to  
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a gross         
concession of $22 per Unit underwritten for Intermediate-Term Trusts and $35 per
Unit underwritten for Long-Term Trusts. The net concession earned by            
Underwriters after giving effect to sales charge discounts will equal the       
amounts shown in the tables below. For a list of the Underwriters that have     
purchased Units from the Sponsor, see "Underwriting" in Prospectus Part I.

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter      
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to         
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters are
eligible to receive a rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate is intended to       
reimburse Underwriters for discounts provided to such broker-dealers and agents,
and on these transactions will equal the amount by which the sum of the related 
broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the regular      
Underwriter concession. The amounts of these rebates are shown in the table     
above. In addition, if a firm commits to act as an Underwriter for a Trust, the 
concessions or agency commissions allowed will equal the amounts shown above on 
all Units of a Trust distributed during the initial offering period and         
purchased directly from the Sponsor rather than the broker-dealer concessions   
described under "Unit Distribution."                                            

Each Underwriter who underwrites 1,000 or more Units in a Trust will  
receive additional compensation from the Sponsor of $1.00 for each Unit it      
underwrites. The breakpoints listed herein will also be applied on a dollar     
basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied  
on whichever basis is more favorable to the Underwriter. The breakpoints will be
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which     
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be  
issued.                                                                         

    In addition, the Sponsor and certain Underwriters will realize a profit or
loss, as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the 
Sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. See "Portfolio" and "Notes to
Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The Sponsor and the Underwriters may also      
realize profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the      
Sponsor from underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has
not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the        
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds were acquired. Underwriters may    
further realize profit or loss during the initial offering period as a result of
possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds       
received from purchasers of Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency       
commissions allowed, if any) will be retained by the Underwriters. Affiliates of
an Underwriter are entitled to the same dealer concessions or agency commissions
that are available to the Underwriter. In addition to any other benefits        
Underwriters may realize from the sale of Units, the Sponsor will share on a pro
rata basis among senior Underwriters (those who underwrite at least 250 Units)  
50% of any gain (less deductions for accrued interest and certain costs)        
represented by the difference between the cost of the bonds to the Sponsor and  
the evaluation of the bonds on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor and certain of  
the other Underwriters will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any 
difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at which
Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for Units and
will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased  
Units at a price above or below the purchase price.                             

Underwriters and broker-dealers, banks and/or others are eligible to  
participate in a program in which such firms receive from the Sponsor a nominal 
award for each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units 
of unit investment trusts created by the Sponsor during a specified time period.
In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs under    
which the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win other nominal awards
for certain sales efforts, or under which the Sponsor will reallow to any such  
firms that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria
established by the Sponsor, or participate in sales programs sponsored by the   
Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales
generated by such persons at the public offering price during such programs.    
Also, the Sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective 
criteria established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying firms for certain    
services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of Units.
Such payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and not out of the 
assets of any Trust. These programs will not change the price Unitholders pay   
for their Units or the amount that the Trust will receive from the Units sold.  
Approximately every eighteen months the Sponsor holds a business seminar which  
is open to Underwriters that sell units of trusts it sponsors. The Sponsor pays 
substantially all costs associated with the seminar, excluding Underwriter      
travel costs. Each Underwriter is invited to send a certain number of           
representatives based on the gross number of units such firm underwrites during 
a designated time period.                                                       

    MARKET FOR UNITS. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to,
and certain of the other Underwriters may, maintain a market for Units and offer
to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the      
aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash  
on hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges      
payable out of your Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of 
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor  
and/or the Underwriters may either discontinue all purchases of Units or        
discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not maintained   
and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will be able to  
dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the         
Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A Unitholder
who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to current   
market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of  
the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will notify the
Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the      
secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit,  
it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would       
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

FEE ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Units may be available for purchase in connection with "wrap fee" accounts
and other similar accounts. You should consult your financial professional to   
determine whether you can benefit from these accounts. For these purchases you  
generally only pay the portion of the sales charge that is retained by your     
Trust's Sponsor, Van Kampen Funds Inc. You should consult the "Public
Offering--General" section for specific information on this and other sales     
charge discounts.                                                               

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DISTRIBUTIONS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless a Unitholder elects
to receive semi-annual distributions. The amount and time of the first          
distribution is described under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in 
Prospectus Part I. The plan of distribution selected by a Unitholder will remain
in effect until changed. Unitholders who purchase Units in the secondary market 
will receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior owner.  
Unitholders may change their distribution plan by indicating the change on a    
card which may be obtained from the Trustee and return the card to the Trustee  
with their certificates and other documentation required by the Trustee.        
Certificates should be sent by registered or certified mail to avoid their being
lost or stolen. If the card and certificate are properly presented to the       
Trustee, the change will become effective on the first day after the next       
semi-annual record date and will remain effective until changed.                

  Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee, without
interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of 
record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be distributed on
each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date.
All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. Funds in the Principal     
Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee is not       
required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or Interest Account (but
may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these   
funds) nor to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the amount  
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit. However,
should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or  
exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the   
Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record
on the related monthly record date.                                             

  Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the
second distribution date after the purchase, under the applicable plan of       
distribution.                                                                   

   REINVESTMENT OPTION. Unitholders may elect to have distributions on their
Units automatically reinvested in shares of certain Van Kampen mutual funds     
which are registered in the Unitholder's state of residence (the "Reinvestment  
Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment objectives that differ from those
of your Trust. The prospectus relating to each Reinvestment Fund describes its  
investment policies and the procedures to follow to begin reinvestment. A       
Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds from Van Kampen   
Funds Inc. at 1 Parkview Plaza, P.O. Box 5555, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois
60181-5555.                                                                     

After becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan, each Trust       
distribution will automatically be applied on the applicable distribution date  
to purchase shares of the applicable Reinvestment Fund at a net asset value     
computed on such date. Unitholders with an existing Planned Reinvestment Option 
(PRO) Program account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution        
reinvestments) may transfer their existing account into a new PRO account which 
allows purchases of Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value. Confirmations  
of all reinvestments will be mailed to the Unitholder by the Reinvestment Fund. 
A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive   
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing at least five  
days before the next distribution date. Each Reinvestment Fund, its sponsor and 
investment adviser have the right to terminate its reinvestment plan at any     
time.                                                                           

REDEMPTION OF UNITS. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units
by tender to the Trustee, at its Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay    
Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10286, of the certificates representing  
the Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of 
transfer with signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, such
as in connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of 
applicable governmental charges, if any. Redemption of Units cannot occur until 
certificates representing the Units or satisfactory indemnity have been received
by the Trustee. No later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender,
the Unitholder will receive an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption     
Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of the tender of      
Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received
by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the Evaluation Time 
on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the    
next day on which that Exchange is open and the Units will be deemed to have    
been tendered to the Trustee on that day for redemption at the Redemption Price.

Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the Trustee is required to
withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not     
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such         
regulations. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service 
and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal  
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".           

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public 
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption    
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price  
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the   
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value 
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts        
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust      
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering Price". In determining the  
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance  
maintained on the bonds in a Trust unless the bonds are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a description of   
the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance obtained by a     
Trust, see "Public Offering--Offering Price". Accrued interest paid on          
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance      
therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be  
withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.     

    The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented by
the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When bonds 
are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may be    
required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in   
lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                                  

The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for       
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that 
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for 
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme             
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full or
partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.           

 EXCHANGE OPTION. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Van Kampen
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial        
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new 
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this 
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment    
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to dis-cuss tax         
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time.                       

UNITS. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book entry form unless a    
Unitholder makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in          
certificate form. Units are transferable by making a written request to the     
Trustee and, in the case of Units in certificate form, by presentation and      
surrender of the certificate to the Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by 
a written instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the     
written request, or certificate transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears
on the records of the Trustee and on the face of any certificate with the       
signature guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents         
Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a signature guaranty program accepted by the     
Trustee. The Trustee may require additional documents such as, but not limited  
to, trust instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or       
administrator or certificates of corporate authority. Certificates will be      
issued in denominations of one Unit or any multiple thereof. Although no such   
charge is now made, the Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee
for each certificate re-issued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge
that may be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, 
stolen, mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the    
Trustee of satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses
incurred. Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for         
replacement.                                                                    

REPORTS PROVIDED. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and
other receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems 
it to be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be
audited annually by independent certified public accountants and the report of  
the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within a         
reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will furnish  
to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a statement     
describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual Trust       
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust information. 
Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the bonds upon     
request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your    
Portfolio, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee. The Sponsor    
does not have access to individual account information.                         

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS 
IN AN INSURED TRUST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in an Insured Trust. An insurance  
policy obtained by an Insured Trust is non-cancelable and will continue in force
so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still 
in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held by the    
Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by the Trust
on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid 
by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any policy is   
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are   
outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The Portfolio  
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described in "Portfolio" for each 
Insured Trust and the notes thereto in Prospectus Part I. More detailed         
information regarding insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and        
Portfolio Insurers is included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

    The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust guarantees the timely
payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due. For this     
purpose, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of 
principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer defaults in the     
payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer enters into a bankruptcy        
proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is accelerated, the affected         
Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the outstanding principal amount of the 
bond plus accrued interest to the date of payment and thereby retire the bond   
from an Insured Trust prior to the bond's stated maturity date. The insurance   
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. The 
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the bond (i.e.,         
insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the holder) (the
"Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance     
premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the bond. It is expected  
that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if 
upon exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds in excess of the sale 
proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.                          

Because the bonds are insured by Portfolio Insurers or Preinsured Bond
Insurers as to the timely payment of principal and interest, when due, and on   
the basis of the various reinsurance agreements in effect, Standard & Poor's has
assigned to the Units of an Insured Trust its "AAA" investment rating. This     
rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the Date of       
Deposit and will, unless renewed, terminate at the end of such period. See      
"Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement. This rating should not  
be construed as an approval of the offering of the Units by Standard & Poor's or
as a guarantee of the market value of an Insured Trust or of the Units.         

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of  
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At the date      
hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be 
submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the    
ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of  
insurance. The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished
by such companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio     
Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and
is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made   
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     SPONSOR. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The Sponsor is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc., which is an indirect  
wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. The Sponsor has its 
principal offices at 1 Parkview Plaza, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois 60181-5555. As
of November 30, 2001, the total stockholders' equity of Van Kampen Funds Inc.   
was $163,449,658 (unaudited). Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted 
a code of ethics requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information
on Trust transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of
the code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud,      
deception or misconduct with respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement  
contains additional information about the Sponsor. If we fail to or cannot      
perform our duties under the trust agreement or become bankrupt, the Trustee may
appoint a new sponsor, continue to operate your Trust without a sponsor, or     
terminate your Trust and distribute the liquidation proceeds.                   

 TRUSTEE. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized
under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its unit investment trust  
division offices at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, telephone     
(800) 221-7668. If you have questions regarding your account or your Portfolio, 
please contact the Trustee at its unit investment trust division offices or your
financial adviser. The Sponsor does not have access to individual account       
information. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and examination by  
the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal      
Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional        
information regarding the Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement,   
including the Trustee's qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the   
effect of a merger involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and
replace the Trustee. See "Additional Information".                              

PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These     
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain 
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the    
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The          
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description of
circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

REPLACEMENT BONDS. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been         
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of 
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must 
(i) be long-term or intermediate term, as applicable, bonds, debentures, notes  
or other straight debt obligations (whether secured or unsecured and whether    
senior or subordinated) without equity or other conversion features, with fixed 
maturity dates substantially the same as those of the Failed Bonds having no    
warrants or subscription privileges attached; (ii) be payable in United States  
currency; (iii) not be when, as and if issued obligations or restricted         
securities; (iv) be issued after July 18, 1984 if the interest is United States 
source income; (v) be issued or guaranteed by an issuer subject to or exempt    
from the reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities     
Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or guaranteed, directly or  
indirectly, by means of a lease agreement, agreement to buy securities, services
or products, or other similar commitment of the credit of such an issuer to the 
payment of the substitute bonds; (vi) maintain the Standard & Poor's AAA rating 
for an Insured Trust; and (vii) be eligible for (and when acquired be insured   
under) the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all 
Unitholders of a Trust within five days after the acquisition of a Replacement  
Bond and shall make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the 
cost of the Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued  
interest. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales   
charge attributable to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of a Trust and       
distribute the principal and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed 
Bonds to the date of removal from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds   
within 30 days after removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated   
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current  
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be  
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in   
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                        

 AMENDMENT OF TRUST AGREEMENT. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely      
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the      
Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the
number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in      
substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in a Trust, except for the
substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of 
any amendment.                                                                  

TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the Units then    
outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of   
the original principal amount of bonds. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder 
of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any         
remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount
than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time. For 
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of 
purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share of the       
balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs,        
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

   LIMITATION ON LIABILITIES. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of
any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the   
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any 
action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not  
liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as     
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be        
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by
the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information
available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in judgment.        

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax      
consequences of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date 
of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these   
summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For     
example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a  
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe your state or foreign
taxes. As with any investment, you should consult your own tax professional     
about your particular consequences. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service   
issued new withholding and reporting regulations effective January 1, 2001.     
Foreign investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax       
consequences of these regulations.                                              

     ASSETS OF A TRUST. Each Trust will hold various debt obligations (the "Debt
Obligations"). All of the assets held by a Trust constitute the "Trust Assets." 
For purposes of this federal tax discussion, it is assumed that the Debt        
Obligations constitute debt the interest on which is includible in gross income 
for federal income tax purposes.                                                

     TRUST STATUS. A Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata   
portion of the assets of your trust, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., interest, accruals of original issue 
discount, and capital gains, if any) from the Trust Assets when such income     
would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the Trust       
Assets. This is true even if you elect to have your distributions automatically 
reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from the Trust Assets 
which you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced 
by amounts used to pay Trust expenses (including the deferred sales charge, if  
any).                                                                           

    YOUR TAX BASIS AND INCOME OR LOSS UPON DISPOSITION. If your Trust disposes
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of   
your Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain
or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your   
tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount       
received in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax basis 
in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, generally including 
sales charges, among each Trust Asset ratably according to their value on the   
date you purchase your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to
adjust your tax basis after you purchase your Units (for example, in the case of
accruals of original issue discount, market discount, premium and accrued       
interest, as discussed below).                                                  

 If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax 
brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for 
long-term gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000, with a     
holding period of more than five years.                                         

 Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period of your Units. The tax     
rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are      
generally the same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however,  
treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.          

DISCOUNT, ACCRUED INTEREST AND PREMIUM ON DEBT OBLIGATIONS. Some Debt 
Obligations may have been sold with original issue discount. This generally     
means that the Debt Obligations were originally issued at a price below their   
face (or par) value. Original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and       
generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes. Your   
basis of each Debt Obligation which was issued with original issue discount must
be increased as original issue discount accrues.                                

 Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
market discount. Market discount is generally the excess of the stated          
redemption price at maturity for the Debt Obligation over the purchase price of 
the Debt Obligation. Market discount can arise based on the price a Trust pays  
for a Debt Obligation or on the price you pay for your Units. Market discount is
taxed as ordinary income. You will recognize this income when your Trust        
receives principal payments on the Debt Obligation, when the Debt Obligation is 
disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem your Units. Alternatively,  
you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues.       
Whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate your basis  
and the timing of certain interest expense deductions. "Stripped" U.S. Treasury 
obligations are subject to the original issue discount rules, rather than being 
treated as having market discount.                                              

     Alternatively, some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your
Trust at a premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any 
Debt Obligation, generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable  
at maturity, such excess is considered premium. You may elect to amortize       
premium. If you make this election, you may reduce your interest income received
on the Debt Obligation by the amount of the premium that is amortized and your  
tax basis will be reduced.                                                      

    If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a Debt Obligation,
you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that Debt Obligation.
When your Trust receives this accrued interest, you must treat it as a return of
capital and reduce your tax basis in the Debt Obligation.                       

 This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,   
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For      
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the          
discussion set forth above in the case of Debt Obligations that were issued with
original issue discount.                                                        

  EXCHANGES. If you elect to reinvest amounts received from a Trust into a
future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes, and any  
gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any loss will be treated
as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in connection with the exchange  
of your Units of your Trust for units of a future trust will generally be       
disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase, to
the extent the two trusts have substantially identical assets under the wash    
sale provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.                                   

    LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You  
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by the Trust to the same    
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may, however, be required to    
treat some or all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized       
deductions. Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized          
deductions to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.               

 FOREIGN, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. Some distributions by your Trust may be
subject to foreign withholding taxes. Any interest withheld will nevertheless be
treated as income to you. However, because you are deemed to have paid directly 
your share of foreign taxes that have been paid or accrued by your Trust, you   
may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for U.S. tax purposes with 
respect to such taxes.                                                          

    If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen
or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you will not  
be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some of
the income from your Trust or on gain from the sale or redemption of your Units,
provided that certain conditions are met. You should consult your tax advisor   
with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for U.S. tax 
purposes.                                                                       

   In the opinion of special counsel to the Trusts for New York tax matters,
the Trusts are not associations taxable as corporations and the income of the   
Trusts will be treated as the income of the Unitholders under the existing      
income tax laws of the State and City of New York.                              

EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may       
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to     
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.     
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until   
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and           
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation, printing
and execution of the Trust Agreement and the certificates, legal and accounting 
expenses, advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial    
evaluation fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor 
at no cost to the Trusts.                                                       

     SPONSOR, SUPERVISOR, EVALUATOR AND TRUSTEE. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated     
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for     
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio   
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of  
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the     
total cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will   
receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's         
portfolio. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under    
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be 
reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its       
services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the      
Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses   
and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders.   
These fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on  
the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on       
January 1 for each year thereafter.                                             

INSURANCE. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of an 
Insured Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As 
bonds covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed  
by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the       
premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the 
right to obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent    
insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related      
bonds.                                                                          

MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any special        
custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds in a     
Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of  
the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for advancing funds  
to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may be adjusted      
periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest rates). Each    
Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement    
each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are       
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in  
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts     
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts.

RISK FACTORS

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor nor
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any
of the bonds.                                                                   

 TAXABLE MUNICIPAL ISSUES. Certain bonds in a Trust may consist of taxable
obligations of municipal issuers. Obligations of municipal issuers can be either
general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power  
of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or
authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.            

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

  Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

     Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

     Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease 
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from 
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and    
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

     Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of
college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,         
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or   
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these       
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on  
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,  
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or 
other regulatory restrictions.                                                  

    Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally         
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.    

  Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

   Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

    Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

    Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate         
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

     Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

     Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

     Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on
variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from     
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail
and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes
and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers
that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                         

   Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

    Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

  Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to    
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for
electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and
rate approvals.                                                                 

ZERO COUPON BONDS. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon" 
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer     
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep  
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond,
but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates
in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially  
greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than
are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.                        

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN AN INSURED TRUST

  Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
each Insured Trust, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior the 
deposit of such bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal,    
when due, in respect of the bonds in such Insured Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the prospectus. Each insurance policy  
obtained by an Insured Trust, is non-cancellable and will continue in force so  
long as such Insured Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is 
still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by 
such Insured Trust (see "Portfolio" for the Trust in the Prospectus Part I).    
Non-payment of premiums on a policy obtained by an Insured Trust will not result
in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action      
against the Trustee to recover premium payments due it. The Trustee in turn will
be entitled to recover such payments from such Insured Trust. Premium rates for 
each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an Insured Trust are    
fixed for the life of an Insured Trust. The premium for any insurance policy or 
policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer, and any   
such policy or policies are non-cancellable and will continue in force so long  
as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the Portfolio Insurer remains in    
business. If the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to 
meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the         
claims-paying ability of any such insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio Insurers  
have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above
described events.                                                               

The aforementioned Trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of     
principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due. For the purposes of the   
Portfolio Insurance, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the
payment of principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a bond
defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such issuer  
enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is         
accelerated, the Portfolio Insurer involved has the option, in its sole         
discretion, for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest 
to occur of such a default, bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the    
outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of  
such payment and thereby retire the bond from an Insured Trust prior to such    
bond's stated maturity date. The insurance does not guarantee the market value  
of the bonds or the value of the Units. Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust  
is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such Insured Trust. In the   
event of a sale of any such bond by the Trustee, such insurance terminates as to
such bond on the date of sale.                                                  

Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the    
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy     
obtained by an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with  
respect to such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the
identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of 
a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from  
the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust
is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee     
would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such        
exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond proceeds less
the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the Permanent        
Insurance) from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold
on an uninsured basis.The insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible  
for Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each 
bond as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any  
change in the creditworthiness of each bond.                                    

The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an    
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by an Insured Trust     
insurance policy may be sold out of the Insured Trust with the benefits of the  
insurance attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the   
time of sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is 
not the case in connection with any value attributable to such Insured Trust's  
portfolio insurance). See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the Prospectus   
Part II. Because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of
the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option, 
the Sponsor anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be       
comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of
default, it is much less likely that the Insured Trust would need at some point 
in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of Units than if the Insured Trust  
were to have no such option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in
the Prospectus Part II) and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust, 
if the Insured Trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk  
of default, the Insured Trust would not need to hold such bonds until their     
respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the Insured Trust's   
portfolio insurance. (See "Trust Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement"
in the Prospectus Part II.)                                                     

Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of
the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right to   
obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or redemption
value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment 
of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. The value of   
the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of a 
bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant  
risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent     
Insurance (less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the  
purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such bond not     
covered by Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the    
Prospectus Part II for a more complete description of an Insured Trust's method 
of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of default.            

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Effective July 14, 1997, 
AMBAC Indemnity Corporation changed its name to Ambac Assurance Corporation. The
Insurance Policy of Ambac Assurance obtained by an Insured Trust is             
noncancellable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in 
the Insurance Policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly premium is paid by 
an Insured Trust for the Insurance Policy obtained by it. The Trustee will pay, 
when due, successively, the full amount of each installment of the insurance    
premium. Pursuant to a binding agreement with Ambac Assurance, in the event of a
sale of a bond covered by the Ambac Assurance Insurance Policy, the Trustee has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance for such bond upon payment of a single  
predetermined premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond.               

   Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, Ambac Assurance agrees to pay to the
Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the bonds insured by   
Ambac Assurance which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by reason
of nonpayment by the issuer of the bonds. The term "due for payment" means, when
referring to the principal of a bond so insured, its stated maturity date or the
date on which it shall have been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption   
and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call
for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration  
or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring to interest on a     
bond, the stated date for payment of interest.                                  

 Ambac Assurance will make payment to the Trustee not later than thirty days
after notice from the Trustee is received by Ambac Assurance that a nonpayment  
of principal or of interest on a bond has occurred, but not earlier than the    
date on which the bonds are due for payment. Ambac Assurance will disburse to   
the Trustee the face amount of principal and interest which is then due for     
payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for     
delivery of bonds, not less in face amount than the amount of the payment in    
bearer form, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In   
cases where bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to   
registered holders or their assigns, Ambac Assurance shall pay principal only   
upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid Bonds uncancelled and free of any 
adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment in satisfactory form,  
so as to permit ownership of such bonds to be registered in the name of Ambac   
Assurance or its nominee. In cases where bonds are issuable only in a form      
whereby interest is payable to registered holders or their assigns, Ambac       
Assurance shall pay interest only upon presentation of proof that the claimant  
is the person entitled to the payment of interest of the bonds and delivery of  
an instrument of assignment, in satisfactory form, transferring to Ambac        
Assurance all right under such bonds to receive the interest of which the       
insurance payment was made.

Financial Security and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of    
writing financial guaranty insurance, principally in respect of securities      
offered in domestic and foreign markets. Financial guaranty insurance provides a
guaranty of scheduled payments of an issuer's securities, thereby enhancing the 
credit rating of those securities, in consideration for payment of a premium to 
the insurer. Financial Security and its subsidiaries principally insure         
asset-backed, collateralized and municipal securities. Asset-backed securities  
are generally supported by residential mortgage loans, consumer or trade        
receivables, securites or other assets having an ascertainable cash flow or     
market value. Collateralized securities include public utility first mortgage   
bonds and sale/leaseback obligation bonds. Municipal securities consist largely 
of general obligation bonds, special revenue bonds and other special obligations
of state and local governments. Financial Security insures both newly issued    
securities sold in the primary market and outstanding securities sold in the    
secondary market that satisfy Financial Security's underwriting criteria.       

Financial Security is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security     
Assurance Holdings Ltd. ("Holdings"), a New York Stock Exchange listed compay.  
Major shareholders of Holdings include XL Capital Ltd. and The Tokio Marine and 
Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. On March 14, 2000, Holdings announced that it had       
entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which Holdings would become a       
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dexia S.A., a publicly held Belgian corporation,     
subject to receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals and satisfaction of  
other closing conditions. Dexia S.A., through its bank subsidiaries, is         
primarily engaged in the business of public finance in France, Belgium and other
European countries. No shareholder of Holdings is obligated to pay any debt of  
Financial Security or any claim under any insurance policy issued by Financial  
Security or to make any additional contribution to the capital of Financial     
Security. As of September 30, 2001, the total policyholders' surplus and        
contingency reserves and the total unearned premium reserve, respectively, of   
Financial Security and its consolidated subsidiaries were, in accordance with   
statutory accounting principles, approximately $1,526,197,000 (unaudited) and   
$784,712,000 (unaudited), and the total shareholders' equity and the unearned   
premium reserve, respectively, of Financial Security and its consolidated       
subsidiaries were, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted  
in the United States, approximately $1,670,116,000 (unaudited), and $646,496,000

Pursuant to an intercompany agreement, liabilities on financial guaranty  
insurance written or reinsured from third parties by Financial Security or its  
domestic or Bermuda operating insurance company subsidiaries are generally      
reinsured among such companies on an agreed-upon percentage substantially       
proportional to their respective capital, surplus and reserves, subject to      
applicable statutory risk limitations. In addition, Financial Security reinsures
a portion of its liabilities under certain various quota share treaties and on a
transaction-by-transaction basis. This reinsurance is used by Financial Security
as a risk management device and to comply with certain statutory and rating     
agency requirements; it does not alter on limit the obligations of Financial    
Security under any financial guaranty insurance policy.                         

 Financial Security's insurance financial strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. Financial Security's insurer financial strength is rated
"AAA" by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Standard &Poor's (Australia)    
Pty. Ltd. Financial Security's claims-paying ability is rated "AAA" by Fitch    
IBCA, Inc. and Japan Rating and Investment Information, Inc. These ratings      
reflect only the views of the respective rating agencies, are not               
recommendations to buy, or sell or hold securities and are subject to revision  
or withdrawal at any time by those rating agencies.                             

Capital Guranty Insurance Company. On December 20, 1995, Capital Guaranty 
Corporation ("CGC") merged with a subsidiary of Financial Security Assurance    
Holdings Ltd. and Capital Guaranty Insurance Company, CGC's principal operating 
subsidiary, changed its name to Financial Security Assurance of Maryland Inc.   
("FSA Maryland") and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security     
Assurance Inc. On September 30, 1997, Financial Security Assurance Inc. assumed 
all of the liabilities of FSA Maryland and sold the FSA Maryland "shell company"
to American Capital Access, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Capital Access
Holdings, Incorporated.                                                         

General. Because the bonds in an Insured Trust are insured as to the timely
payment of principal and interest, when due (as more fully described above), and
on the basis of the various reinsurance agreements in effect, Standard & Poor's 
has assigned to the Units its "AAA" investment rating. Such rating will be in   
effect for a period of thirteen months from the Date of Deposit and will, unless
renewed, terminate at the end of such period. The obtaining of this rating by an
Insured Trust should not be construed as an approval of the offering of the     
Units by Standard & Poor's or as a guarantee of the market value of the Insured 
Trust or of the Units.                                                          

An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is to  
obtain a higher yield on the Insured Trust portfolio than would be available if 
all the bonds in such portfolio had Standard & Poor's "AAA" rating and yet at   
the same time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest 
and principal, when due (as more fully described above), on the bonds. There is,
of course, no certainty that this result will be achieved.                      

    In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due (as more fully
described above), in respect of a bond, the appropriate Insurer shall make such 
payment within 30 days after it has been notified that such nonpayment has      
occurred. The appropriate Insurer, as regards any payment it may make, will     
succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect thereof.                        

The information relating to the Insurers has been furnished by the      
respective Insurers. The financial information with respect to the Insurers     
appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is     
subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made      
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION

The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units    
tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may 
not be available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee 
in its sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such  
bonds, will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b)    
market value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are 
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption        
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve 
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, if any, the overall  
quality of the bonds remaining in a Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. The
Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose of    
bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.                                    

   The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution for
any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the Sponsor   
may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other 
action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the issuer is 
in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of the       
Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the       
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution 
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust    
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within   
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for      
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each        
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor.
Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement Bonds" in  
the Prospectus Part II regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds for      
Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a Trust of any bonds other than the bonds      
initially deposited is not permitted.                                           

 If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio  
insurance, or otherwise, within 30 days, the Trustee is required to notify the  
Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee to sell or to hold
such bonds within 30 days after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor of   
such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted Bond and not 
be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.

records shall include the name and address of, and the certificates issued by   
the Trusts to, every Unitholder of the Trusts. Such books and records shall be  
open to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual   
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from 
time to time be required under any applicable state or Federal statute, rule or 
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the bonds held in the Trusts.                   

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has      
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and bonds of the original trustee shall 
vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective
only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court 
of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any corporation into    
which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any      
corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which a Trustee shall 
be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee must be a banking       
corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state and      
having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not  
less than $5,000,000.                                                           

TERMINATION OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT

    A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
51% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value 
of the Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the   
original principal amount of bonds.                                             

A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,   
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to   
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If a Trust is       
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the   
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by  
such purchaser.                                                                 

The Trust Agreement provides that a Trust shall terminate upon the      
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but in
no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth    
anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of a Long-Term Trust and at the  
end of the calender year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in 
the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust. In the event of termination of a Trust, 
written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder at his    
address appearing on the registration books of the Trust maintained by the      
Trustee, such notice specifying the time or times at which the Unitholder may   
surrender his certificate or certificates for cancellation. Within a reasonable 
time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any bonds then held in a Trust and  
shall deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs, expenses or         
indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of
the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to   
provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges. The  
sale of bonds in a Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than     
might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For    
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the 
Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each        
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With
such distribution the Unitholders shall be furnished a final distribution       
statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole  
discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer       
necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.

DESCRIPTION OF RATINGS

STANDARD & POOR'S, A DIVISION OF THE MCGRAW-HILL COMPANIES. A Standard &  
Poor's corporate or municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the        
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond. This       
assessment of creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as     
guarantors, insurers or lessees.                                                

The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security,   
inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price.                             

 The ratings are based on current information furnished to Standard & Poor's
by the issuer and obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers 
reliable. The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of     
changes in, or unavailability of, such information.                             

 The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations:

   I.   Likelihood of default--capacity and willingness of the obligor as to
the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in
accordance with the terms of the obligation.                

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the bond in the
       event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

  AAA--This is the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt bond
and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and interest.       

   AA--Bonds rated AA also qualify as high-quality debt obligations. Capacity to
pay principal and interest is very strong, and in the majority of instances they
differ from AAA issues only in small degree.                                    

A--Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest,    
although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions.                                          

BBB--Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay   
interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection 
parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more      
likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for   
debt in this category than in higher rated categories.                          

Plus (+) or Minus (-): To provide more detailed indications of credit     
quality, the ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by the addition of a    
plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.

Provisional Ratings: A provisional rating ("p") assumes the successful    
completion of the project being financed by the issuance of the bonds being     
rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or     
entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project.    
This rating, however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion, 
makes no comment on the likelihood of, or the risk of default upon failure of,  
such completion. Accordingly, the investor should exercise his own judgment with
respect to such likelihood and risk.                                            

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. A brief description of the applicable 
Moody's rating symbols and their meanings follows:                              

  Aaa--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be the best quality. They carry
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt   
edge". Interest payments are protected by a large, or by an exceptionally       
stable, margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements   
are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to    
impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues. With the occasional    
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances, the safety of obligations  
of this class is so absolute that their market value is affected solely by money
market fluctuations.                                                            

Aa--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all      
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as
high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of   
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of          
protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements  
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa       
securities. These Aa bonds are high grade, their market value virtually immune  
to all but money market influences, with the occasional exception of oversupply 
in a few specific instances.                                                    

 A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and
are to be considered as higher medium grade obligations. Factors giving security
to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present  
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future. The market 
value of A-rated bonds may be influenced to some degree by credit circumstances 
during a sustained period of depressed business conditions. During periods of   
normalcy, bonds of this quality frequently move in parallel with Aaa and Aa     
obligations, with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific      
instances.                                                                      

Baa--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations;
i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments   
and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective   
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in   
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic  
rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the bond ranks at the high 
end of its category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the      
modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating
category.                                                                       

  Con--Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or
the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally. These are bonds      
secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction, (b) earnings of projects
unseasoned in operating experience, (c) rentals which begin when facilities are 
completed, or (d) payments to which some other limiting condition attaches.     
Parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of         
construction or elimination of basis of condition.                              

 ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS TO UNITHOLDERS

The tables below set forth the per Unit estimated monthly and semi-annual 
distributions of interest and principal to Unitholders. The tables assume no    
changes in expenses, no changes in the current interest rates, no exchanges,    
redemptions, sales or prepayments of the underlying bonds prior to maturity or  
expected retirement date and the receipt of principal upon maturity or expected 
retirement date. To the extent the foregoing assumptions change actual          
distributions will vary.

Weighted Avg Market Cap (MM)

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the industrials, energy, financial services, healthcare, consumer staples and utility industries. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.An issuer of Securities held by the Trust may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This could result in a reduction in the value of your Units. The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by companies in the financial services and utility industries, and, as a result of its expected higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust is expected to exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.

About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them.

Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the industrials, energy, financial services, healthcare, consumer staples and utility industries. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.An issuer of Securities held by the Trust may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This could result in a reduction in the value of your Units. The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by companies in the financial services and utility industries, and, as a result of its expected higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust is expected to exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market.

Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.

The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee.

These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the industrials, energy, financial services, healthcare, consumer staples and utility industries. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.An issuer of Securities held by the Trust may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This could result in a reduction in the value of your Units. The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by companies in the financial services and utility industries, and, as a result of its expected higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust is expected to exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market.

VAN KAMPEN FOCUS PORTFOLIOS (SM)
 A DIVISION OF VAN KAMPEN FUNDS INC.
 FLORIDA IM-IT 130

  Florida Insured Municipals Income Trust, Series 130 invests in a portfolio
of tax-exempt municipal bonds. The Trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt    
income and to preserve capital. The Trust is a unit investment trust included in
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal Series 374.

Estimated Current Return:                 4.61%                    4.65%      
Estimated Long Term Return:               4.66%                    4.71%      
CUSIP:                                 34074C-52-5 34074C-53-3 

Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each 
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated  
return over the estimated life of your Trust. We base this estimate on an       
average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This estimate also        
reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the average yield   
for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value and estimated    
life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return accounts for  
maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates show a         
comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation can       
predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these estimates.   

 PROSPECTUS PART I
APRIL 19, 2002

 This prospectus contains two parts.

 No one may use this Prospectus Part I unless accompanied by Prospectus Part II.

 YOU SHOULD READ THIS PROSPECTUS AND RETAIN IT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of

(1) Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This   
    could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot guarantee
 that the value of your Units will equal the principal amount of bonds per
Unit when you redeem them or when your Trust terminates.                

(2) After the first settlement date (April 24, 2002), you will pay accrued      
    interest from this date to your settlement date less interest distributions.

(3) We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary 
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of  
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.    

(4) This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than insurance        
expenses.                                                                       

(5) Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your     
Trust assesses other fees per Unit.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO 

(1) The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for   
  the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
   affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
    acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from April 16, 2002 to
April 18, 2002.                                                         

(2) Other information regarding the bonds is as follows:                        

   COST TO           PROFIT (LOSS)
 SPONSOR            TO SPONSOR
---------------      ---------------
$    2,839,342        $     19,376      

The breakdown of the preinsured bond insurers is as follows: AMBAC    
Assurance 29%, Financial Guaranty 61% and FSA 10%.                              

The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate 
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the           
corresponding gain or loss is included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked by  
"##" following the maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and if      
issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins accruing to 
the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. Delivery is   
expected to take place at various dates after the first settlement date.        

"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an 
original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part II.  
The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is described in    
"Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.                                     

(3) All ratings are by Standard & Poor's unless otherwise indicated. "*"        
   indicates that the rating of the bond is by Moody's. "o" indicates that the
rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating agency of a policy of   
insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. "NR" indicates that the  
rating service did not provide a rating for that bond. For a brief      
  description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the Information
Supplement.                                                             

(4) This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and  
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at     
 declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
    issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price
    plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus,
   if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an
  issue of bonds. Certain bonds may be subject to redemption without premium
prior to the date shown pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory 
redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in  
Prospectus Part II.                                                     

FLORIDA. The financial condition of the State of Florida is affected by   
various national, economic, social and environmental policies and conditions.   
Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on the State and 
its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may 
constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its local governments
and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their        
obligations. The State Constitution and statutes mandate that the State budget, 
as a whole, and each separate fund within the State budget, be kept in balance  
from currently available revenues each fiscal year. Additionally, the State     
Constitution prohibits issuance of State obligations to fund State operations.  

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. The State continues to be dependent on the        
construction and construction related manufacturing industries. These industries
tend to be highly cyclical and there is no assurance that Florida's rapid       
population growth, which drove these industries in the past, will continue.     
Tourism is also one of the State's most important industries. Because many      
international travelers visit Florida, an increase in the value of the U.S.     
dollar adversely affects this industry. Moreover, Florida could be impacted by  
problems in the agricultural sector, including crop failures, severe weather    
conditions or other agricultural-related problems, particularly with regard to  
the citrus and sugar industries.                                                

  The State is a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final decision
could materially affect the State's governmental operations and consequently its
ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                                 

  The State maintains a bond rating of Aa2 and AA+ from Moody's and Standard &
Poor's, respectively, on the majority of its general obligation bonds, although 
the rating of a particular series of revenue bonds relates primarily to the     
project, facility, or other revenue resource from which such series derives     
funds for repayment.                                                            

Further information concerning Florida risk factors may be obtained upon  
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information" appearing in    
Prospectus Part II.                                                             

TAX STATUS. For a discussion of the Federal tax status of income earned on
Florida IM-IT Trust Units, see "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.      

The bonds were accompanied by opinions of bond counsel to the respective  
issuers thereof to the effect that the bonds were exempt from the Florida       
intangibles tax. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have independently reviewed
such opinions or examined the bonds to be deposited in and held by the Florida  
IM-IT Trust and have assumed the correctness as of the date of deposit of the   
opinions of bond counsel. It is assumed for purposes of the opinion below the   
bonds constitute debt for Federal income tax purposes.                          

  "Non-Corporate Unitholder" means a Unitholder of the Florida IM-IT Trust who
is an individual not subject to the Florida state income tax on corporations    
under Chapter 220, Florida Statutes and "Corporate Unitholder" means a          
Unitholder of the Florida IM-IT Trust that is a corporation, bank or savings    
association or other entity subject to Florida state income tax on corporations 
or franchise tax imposed on banks or savings associations under Chapter 220,    
Florida Statutes.                                                               

  In the opinion of Chapman and Cutler, counsel to the Sponsor, in summary
under existing law: For Florida state income tax purposes, the Florida IM-IT    
Trust will not be subject to the Florida income tax imposed by Chapter 220,     
Florida Statutes.                                                               

 Because Florida does not impose an income tax on individuals, Non-Corporate
Unitholders residing in Florida will not be subject to any Florida income       
taxation on income realized by the Florida IM-IT Trust. Any amounts paid to the 
Florida IM-IT Trust or to Non-Corporate Unitholders under an insurance policy   
issued to the Florida IM-IT Trust or the Sponsor which represent maturing       
interest on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will not be subject to the
Florida income tax imposed by Chapter 220, Florida Statutes.                    

   Corporate Unitholders with commercial domiciles in Florida will be subject to
Florida income or franchise taxation on income realized by the Florida IM-IT    
Trust and on payments of interest pursuant to any insurance policy to the extent
such income constitutes "non business income" as defined by Chapter 220 or is   
otherwise allocable to Florida under Chapter 220. Other Corporate Unitholders   
will be subject to Florida income or franchise taxation on income realized by   
the Florida IM-IT Trust (or on payments of interest pursuant to any insurance   
policy) only to the extent that the income realized does not constitute         
"non-business income" as defined by Chapter 220 and if such income is otherwise 
allocable to Florida under Chapter 220.                                         

Units will be subject to Florida estate tax only if held by Florida       
residents. However, the Florida estate tax is limited to the amount of the      
credit for state death taxes provided for in Section 2011 of the Internal       
Revenue Code.                                                                   

Neither the bonds nor the Units will be subject to the Florida ad valorem 
property tax, the Florida intangible personal property tax or the Florida sales 
or use tax.                                                                     

Chapman and Cutler has expressed no opinion with respect to taxation under
any other provision of Florida law. Ownership of the Units may result in        
collateral Florida tax consequences to certain taxpayers. Prospective investors 
should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such collateral
consequences.                                                                   

EXCHANGE OPTION. During the initial offering period of the Trust, unitholders
of any Van Kampen-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of            
unaffiliated unit investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination 
proceeds from such trust to purchase Units of the Trust at a reduced sales      
charge equal to the lesser of $35 per Unit or 3.50% of the Public Offering Price
per Unit. Broker-dealers and other selling firms will be allowed a concession or
agency commission in connection with these transactions equal to $25 per Unit.  

UNIT DISTRIBUTION. In addition to the compensation paid or allowed to     
broker-dealers and Underwriters described in "Public Offering--Unit
Distribution" and "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" oN    
pages A-10 to A-12 of Prospectus Part II, all broker-dealers and other selling  
firms will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total initial
offering period sales of all Van Kampen unit investment trusts during a         
Quarterly Period as set forth in the following table:

      INITIAL OFFERING PERIOD                   VOLUME
  SALES DURING QUARTERLY PERIOD               CONCESSION
    ------------------------------             -------------
  $2 million but less than $5 million             0.025%
 $5 million but less than $10 million            0.050
 $10 million but less than $50 million           0.075
 $50 million or more                             0.100

  "Quarterly Period" means the following periods: December - February; March -
May; June - August; and September - November. Broker-dealers and other selling  
firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale of (1)   
units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge (as defined in      
appplicable prospectuses) or (2) units of Van Kampen unit investment trusts     
initially offered prior to December 17, 2001, however, such sales will be       
included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints set  
forth in the table above. Secondary market sales of all unit investment trusts  
are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions. The Sponsor will pay     
these amounts out of its own assets within a reasonable time following each     
Quarterly Period.

REPORT OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Unitholders of
Florida IM-IT 130 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal Series    
374):                                                                           

  We have audited the accompanying statement of condition and the portfolio of
Florida IM-IT 130 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal Series    
374) as of April 19, 2002. The statement of condition and portfolio are the     
responsibility of the Sponsor. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on   
such financial statements based on our audit.                                   

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally    
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan  
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of an irrevocable letter of    
credit deposited to purchase tax-exempt bonds by correspondence with the        
Trustee. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and    
significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall    
financial statement presentation. We believe our audit provides a reasonable    
basis for our opinion.                                                          

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Florida IM-IT 130 (included in 
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal Series 374) as of April 19, 2002, in     
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each 
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated  
return over the estimated life of your Trust. We base this estimate on an       
average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This estimate also        
reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the average yield   
for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value and estimated    
life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return accounts for  
maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates show a         
comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation can       
predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these estimates.

(1)  Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This  
could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot    
   guarantee that the value of your Units will equal the principal amount of
bonds per Unit when you redeem them or when your Trust terminates.    

(2)  After the first settlement date (April 24, 2002), you will pay accrued     
interest from this date to your settlement date less interest         
distributions.                                                        

(3)  We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.  

(4)  This shows estimated expenses in the first year.                           

(5)  Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your    
Trust assesses other fees per Unit.                                   

(6)  During the first year the Trustee will reduce its fee by approximately $.06
per Unit (which is the estimated interest to be earned prior to the   
expected delivery dates for the "when, as and if issued" or "delayed  
    delivery" bonds). Should the interest exceed this amount, the Trustee will
  reduce its fee up to its annual fee. After the first year, the Trustee's
fee will be the amount indicated above. Estimated interest income will
 increase to $56.17. Estimated expenses will increase to $2.17 and $1.74
under the monthly and semi-annual distribution plans, respectively.   
Estimated net interest income will remain as shown.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO 

(1) The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for   
  the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
   affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
    acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from December 17, 2001
to April 18, 2002.                                                      

(2) Other information regarding the bonds is as follows:                        

   COST TO           PROFIT (LOSS)
 SPONSOR            TO SPONSOR
---------------      ---------------
$    8,648,600        $     75,914      

The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate 
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the           
corresponding gain or loss is included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked by  
"##" following the maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and if      
issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins accruing to 
the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. Delivery is   
expected to take place at various dates after the first settlement date.        

"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an 
original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part II.  
The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is described in    
"Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.                                     

(3) "o" indicates that the rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating      
 agency of a policy of insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. "NR"
 indicates that the rating service did not provide a rating for that bond.
  For a brief description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the
Information Supplement.                                                 

(4) This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and  
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at     
 declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
    issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price
    plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus,
   if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an
  issue of bonds. Certain bonds may be subject to redemption without premium
prior to the date shown pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory 
redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in  
Prospectus Part II.                                                     

EXCHANGE OPTION. During the initial offering period of the Trust, unitholders
of any Van Kampen-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of            
unaffiliated unit investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination 
proceeds from such trust to purchase Units of the Trust at a reduced sales      
charge equal to the lesser of $35 per Unit or 3.50% of the Public Offering Price
per Unit. Broker-dealers and other selling firms will be allowed a concession or
agency commission in connection with these transactions equal to $25 per Unit.  

UNIT DISTRIBUTION. In addition to the compensation paid or allowed to     
broker-dealers and Underwriters described in "Public Offering--Unit
Distribution" and "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" on    
pages A-10 to A-12 of Prospectus Part II, all broker-dealers and other selling  
firms will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total initial
offering period sales of all Van Kampen unit investment trusts during a         
Quarterly Period as set forth in the following table:                           

                                            ADDITIONAL
     INITIAL OFFERING PERIOD                VOLUME
  SALES DURING QUARTERLY PERIOD             CONCESSION
    ------------------------------           -------------
    $2 million but less than $5 million             0.025%
   $5 million but less than $10 million            0.050
   $10 million but less than $50 million           0.075
   $50 million or more                             0.100

  "Quarterly Period" means the following periods: December - February; March -
May; June - August; and September - November. Broker-dealers and other selling  
firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale of (1)   
units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge (as defined in      
appplicable prospectuses) or (2) units of Van Kampen unit investment trusts     
initially offered prior to December 17, 2001, however, such sales will be       
included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints set  
forth in the table above. Secondary market sales of all unit investment trusts  
are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions. The Sponsor will pay     
these amounts out of its own assets within a reasonable time following each     
Quarterly Period.                                                               

UNDERWRITING. The Underwriters named below have purchased Units in the
following amounts from the Sponsor. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and
Underwriter Compensation" in Prospectus Part II.

REPORT OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Unitholders of
Investment Grade Municipal Trust, Series 12 (included in Van Kampen Focus       
Portfolios, Municipal Series 374):                                              

  We have audited the accompanying statement of condition and the portfolio of
Investment Grade Municipal Trust, Series 12 (included in Van Kampen Focus       
Portfolios, Municipal Series 374) as of April 19, 2002. The statement of        
condition and portfolio are the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our              
responsibility is to express an opinion on such financial statements based on   
our audit.                                                                      

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally    
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan  
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of an irrevocable letter of    
credit deposited to purchase tax-exempt bonds by correspondence with the        
Trustee. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and    
significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall    
financial statement presentation. We believe our audit provides a reasonable    
basis for our opinion.                                                          

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Investment Grade Municipal     
Trust, Series 12 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal Series 374)
as of April 19, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally        
accepted in the United States of America.

THE TRUSTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. Your Trust is one of several unit investment trusts created under
the name Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal Series. The Trusts were created 
under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture and       
Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the date of Prospectus Part I (the     
"Date of Deposit") among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as Sponsor, Van Kampen          
Investment Advisory Corp., as Supervisor, J.J. Kenny Co., Inc., as Evaluator,   
and The Bank of New York, as Trustee.                                           

   The Trusts are separate portfolios of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of states and territories of the United States, and political   
subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in the opinion  
of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities, excludable from gross    
income for Federal income tax purposes under existing law. All issuers of bonds 
in a State Trust are located in the state for which the Trust is named or in    
United States territories or possessions and their public authorities;          
consequently, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the bond issuers, the
interest earned on the bonds is exempt to the extent indicated in Prospectus    
Part I from state and local taxes. Further, in the opinion of bond counsel to   
the respective issuers, the interest income of each bond in a U.S. Territorial  
IM-IT Trust is exempt from state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and local income  
taxation. With the exception of New York and Pennsylvania Trusts, Units of a    
State Trust may be purchased only by residents of the state for which the Trust 
is named. Units of a New York Trust may be purchased by residents of New York,  
Connecticut and Florida. Units of a Pennsylvania Trust may be purchased by      
residents of Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, New York, Ohio and   
West Virginia. Trusts that hold only insured bonds or bonds that are insured    
under a portfolio insurance policy are referred to herein as "Insured Trusts".  
Trusts that primarily hold bonds issued by a single state, including political  
subdivisions and authorities thereof, are referred to herein as "State Trusts". 
State Trusts, other than State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trusts or State   
Intermediate Trusts, are referred to herein as "Long-Term State Trusts".        

On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the    
aggregate principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I. The bonds in a Trust initially     
consist of delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and     
cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a         
financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds in a  
Trust, delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the number of Units    
indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part 
I.                                                                              

 The portfolio of any IM-IT, Investment Grade Municipal, IM-IT Discount,
U.S. Territorial IM-IT, Long-Term State or National Quality Trust consists of   
bonds maturing approximately 15 to 40 years from the Date of Deposit. The       
approximate range of maturities from the Date of Deposit for bonds in any IM-IT 
Limited Maturity Trust, IM-IT Intermediate Trust, State Intermediate Laddered   
Maturity Trust and IM-IT Short Intermediate Trust is 12 to 15 years, 5 to 15    
years, 5 to 10 years and 3 to 7 years, respectively. The portfolio of any State 
Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust is structured so that approximately 20% of 
the bonds will mature each year, beginning in approximately the fifth year of   
the Trust, entitling each Unitholder to a return of principal. This return of   
principal may offer Unitholders the opportunity to respond to changing economic 
conditions and to specific financial needs that may arise between the fifth and 
tenth years of the Trust. However, the flexibility provided by the return of    
principal may also eliminate a Unitholder's ability to reinvest at a rate as    
high as the yield on the bonds which matured.                                   

   Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in
the principal and net income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are       
redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in a Trust           
represented by each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the     
Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by    
Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust Agreement.                    

OBJECTIVES AND BOND SELECTION. The objectives of the Trusts are income
exempt from Federal income taxation and, in the case of a State Trust, Federal  
and state income taxation and conservation of capital through an investment in  
diversified portfolios of Federal and state tax-exempt obligations. A State     
Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust has additional objectives of providing     
protection against changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through 
an investment in a laddered portfolio of intermediate-term interest-bearing     
obligations with maturities ranging from approximately 5 to 10 years in which   
roughly 20% of the bonds mature each year beginning in approximately the fifth  
year of the Trust. There is, of course, no guarantee that the Trusts will       
achieve their objectives. A Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for  
investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of tax-exempt fixed income   
bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire           
individually. Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all       
principal and interest on the bonds in each Insured Trust has been obtained from
a municipal bond insurance company. For information relating to insurance on the
bonds, see "Insurance on the Bonds in the Insured Trusts". In addition, these   
bonds are often not available in small amounts.                                 

 In selecting bonds for the Trusts, the Sponsor considered the following
factors, among others: (a) either the Standard & Poor's rating of the bonds was 
not less than "BBB-" ("A-" for Quality Trusts), or the Moody's Investors        
Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating of the bonds was not less than "Baa3" ("A3" for
the Quality Trusts), including provisional or conditional ratings, respectively,
(or, if not rated, the bonds had credit characteristics sufficiently similar to 
the credit characteristics of interest-bearing tax-exempt bonds that were so    
rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a Trust in the opinion of the      
Sponsor), (b) the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable     
quality and maturity, (c) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue   
and location of issuer and (d) with respect to the Insured Trusts, the          
availability and cost of insurance. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease 
to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the   
Date of Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but  
may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct 
the Trustee to dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio
Administration"). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in an Investment Grade
Municipal Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or      
"Baa3") during the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. 
See "The Trusts--Risk Factors".                                                 

THE BONDS. Your Trust invests in municipal bonds. States, municipalities
and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of        
purposes. In selecting bonds, the Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by  
bond purpose. This section briefly describes different bond types to help you   
better understand your investment. The types of bonds in your portfolio are     
listed in Prospectus Part I. These bonds are also described in greater detail in
the Information Supplement.                                                     

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

  Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

     Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

     Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease 
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from 
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and    
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

     Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of
college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,         
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or   
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these       
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on  
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,  
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or 
other regulatory restrictions.                                                  

    Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally         
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.    

  Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

   Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

    Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

    Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate         
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

     Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

     Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

     Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on
variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from     
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail
and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes
and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers
that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                         

   Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

    Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

  Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to    
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for
electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and
rate approvals.                                                                 

   MORE ABOUT THE BONDS. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds,
other information about the bonds is also listed in the "Portfolio" in          
Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the     
bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.            

    Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.         

   Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds
do not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor own this type 
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par
value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during     
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

"When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are   
actually issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust
"when, as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be 
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to    
your Trust until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to    
adjust your tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the      
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued      
between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your 
Trust. This could lower your first year estimated current return. You may       
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even 
though your Trust has not yet received them.                                    

RISK FACTORS. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand   
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of    
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one   
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a  
more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment.                   

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if   
interest rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise 
and rise in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before    
maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes.                     

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet
its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                        

    Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original 
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to 
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to  
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less   
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par   
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your 
Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate     
early. The first date that the issuer can call each bond is listed in the       
portfolio in Prospectus Part I along with the price the issuer would have to    
pay.                                                                            

  Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating.                                             

 Bond concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified
because it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of    
bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be             
"concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are described under  
"The Bonds".                                                                    

Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become  
smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

     Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market
will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the              
over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).         

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or 
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. For example, future           
legislation could reduce tax rates, impose a flat tax, exempt all investment    
income from tax or change the tax status of the bonds. Litigation could         
challenge an issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.             

     NO FDIC GUARANTEE. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Estimated Current Returns and the Estimated Long-Term Returns as of the
Date of Deposit are set forth on the cover of the Prospectus Part I. Estimated  
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest      
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest 
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the Trust and    
with the principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds. 
The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.     
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Current Return    
will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a
formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the   
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the 
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales      
charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated retirements of the  
bonds and the expenses of a Trust will change, there is no assurance that the   
present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the future. The Estimated
Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the
calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount
of principal returned while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes   
only net annual interest income and Public Offering Price.                      

   In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the
First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary  
to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from     
interest payments on the related bonds. Also, since interest on any "when, as   
and if issued" bonds does not begin accruing as tax-exempt interest income to   
the benefit of Unitholders until the date of delivery, the Trustee may reduce   
its fee and pay Trust expenses in order to maintain or approach the same        
estimated net annual interest income during the first year of the Trust's       
operations as described under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in   
Prospectus Part I.                                                              

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial
offering period the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate offering    
price of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the      
Principal Account and accrued interest, if any. After the initial public        
offering period, the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid 
prices of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the     
Principal Account and accrued interest, if any. The minimum purchase in the     
primary and secondary market is one Unit.                                       

The initial offering period sales charges are as follows:

which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the Trusts' requirement that only                                          
whole Units be issued.                                                                                                 

     The secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following                                       
table based upon the estimated long-term return life of a Trust's portfolio:

   For purposes of computation of the estimated long-term return life, bonds
will be deemed to mature on their expressed maturity dates unless: (a) the bonds
have been called for redemption or are subject to redemption at an earlier call 
date, in which case this call date will be deemed to be the maturity date; or   
(b) the bonds are subject to a "mandatory tender", in which case the mandatory  
tender will be deemed to be the maturity date. The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds.   
Expressed as a percent of the Public Offering Price, the sales charge on a Trust
consisting entirely of bonds with 15 years to maturity would be 4.80%. The sales
charges in the table above do not apply to IM-IT Discount Trusts. The applicable
secondary market sales charges for an IM-IT Discount Trust are set forth in the 
applicable Prospectus Part I.                                                   

    Any reduced sales charge is the responsibility of the selling Underwriter,
broker, dealer or agent. The Sponsor will, however, increase the concession or  
agency commission for quantity purchases. The reduced sales charge structure in 
the initial offering period sales charge table above will apply on all purchases
by the same person from any one Underwriter or dealer of units of Van Kampen    
unit investment trusts which are being offered in the initial offering period   
(a) on any one day (the "Initial Purchase Date") or (b) on any day subsequent to
the Initial Purchase Date, if the units purchased are of a unit investment trust
purchased on the Initial Purchase Date. In the event units of more than one     
trust are purchased on the Initial Purchase Date, the aggregate dollar amount of
such purchases will be used to determine whether purchasers are eligible for a  
reduced sales charge. Such aggregate dollar amount will be divided by the public
offering price per unit (on the day preceding the date of purchase) of each     
respective trust purchased to determine the total number of units which such    
amount could have purchased of each individual trust. Purchasers must then      
consult the applicable trust's prospectus to determine whether the total number 
of units which could have been purchased of a specific trust would have         
qualified for a reduced sales charge and, if so qualified, the amount of such   
reduction. Assuming a purchaser qualifies for a sales charge reduction or       
reductions, to determine the applicable sales charge reduction or reductions it 
is necessary to accumulate all purchases made on the Initial Purchase Date and  
all purchases made in accordance with (b) above. Units purchased in the name of 
the spouse of a purchaser or in the name of a child of such purchaser (family   
members") will be deemed for the purposes of calculating the applicable sales   
charge to be additional purchases by the purchaser. The reduced sales charges   
will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for one
or more trust, estate or fiduciary accounts. If you purchased Units on more than
one day to achieve the discounts described in this paragraph, the discount      
allowed on any single day will apply only to Units purchased on that day (a     
retroactive discount is not given on all prior purchases).                      

Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses, children, 
grandchildren, parents, grandparents, siblings, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, 
sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for   
the benefit of such persons (collectively referred to herein as "related        
purchasers")) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates and Underwriters and  
their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the       
applicable underwriting commission or less the applicable dealer concession in  
the absence of an underwriting commission. Employees, officers and directors    
(including related purchasers) of dealers and their affiliates and vendors      
providing services to the Sponsor may purchase Units at the Public Offering     
Price less the applicable dealer concession.                                    

    Purchasers of units of any two consecutive series of a Trust may aggregate
purchases of units of such series for purposes of the sales charge reduction for
quantity purchases, provided that at the time of the initial purchase of units  
such purchaser submitted a purchase order for at least 100 units that was       
partially unfulfilled due to a lack of units of such Trust series available for 
sale at such time. The sales charge reduction shall be applied to the subsequent
purchase of units such that the aggregate sales charge reduction applicable to  
both purchases will equal the amount described in the initial offering period   
sales charge table above.                                                       

A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in 
this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of  
the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the section   
called "Wrap Fee and Advisory Accounts" for additional information on these     
purchases. Units may be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the     
Public Offering Price (for purchases which do not qualify for a sales charge    
reduction for quantity purchases) less the concession the Sponsor typically     
allows to brokers and dealers for purchases by (1) investors who purchase Units 
through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners and        
registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for      
brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management 
services, or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an   
investment account for which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge is imposed, (2)  
bank trust departments investing funds over which they exercise exclusive       
discretionary investment authority and that are held in a fiduciary, agency,    
custodial or similar capacity, (3) any person who for at least 90 days, has been
an officer, director or bona fide employee of any firm offering Units for sale  
to investors or their immediate family members (as described above) and (4)     
officers and directors of bank holding companies that make Units available      
directly or through subsidiaries or bank affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this prospectus, such investors, bank trust departments, firm   
employees and bank holding company officers and directors who purchase Units    
through this program will not receive sales charge reductions for quantity      
purchases.                                                                      

OFFERING PRICE. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the 
amounts stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus 
Part I in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of 
Units on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales      
charge to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the 
number of Units outstanding. This price determination was made on the basis of  
an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the Evaluator. During the initial        
offering period, the Evaluator will value the bonds as of the Evaluation Time on
days the New York Stock Exchange is open for business and will adjust the Public
Offering Price of Units accordingly. This Public Offering Price will be         
effective for all orders received at or prior to the Evaluation Time on each    
such day. The "Evaluation Time" is the close of regular trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange on each day that the Exchange is open for trading. Orders        
received by the Trustee, Sponsor or any Underwriter for purchases, sales or     
redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is    
closed, will be held until the next determination of price. The secondary market
Public Offering Price per Unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the  
bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by 
the number of Units outstanding. For secondary market purposes, this computation
will be made by the Evaluator as of the Evaluation Time for each day on which   
any Unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary. The offering price of     
bonds may be expected to average approximately 0.5%-1% more than the bid price. 

   The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices
or offering prices, as is appropriate, (a) on the basis of current market prices
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to    
those held by the Trusts; (b) if these prices are not available, on the basis of
current market prices for comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the     
bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting 
or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market  
prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest    
rates. Unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in    
significant risk of default, the Evaluator will not attribute any value to the  
insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any.                                 

     The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant
risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance guaranteeing 
interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will be equal to the
difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise
of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premiums and     
related expenses attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii)  
the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In      
addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of a Portfolio Insurer to meet
its commitments under any insurance policy, including commitments to issue      
Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by an     
Insured Trust, if any, as of the date of this prospectus.                       

    A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

     ACCRUED INTEREST. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although each Trust accrues   
interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an amount of interest earned
but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with respect to sales    
settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate share of accrued    
interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering Price of Units. 
Unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their Units on  
the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest which   
would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount of    
accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First     
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account     
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates  
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the    
amount of interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to Unitholders. 
If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he will be      
entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the    
purchaser of his Units.                                                         

UNIT DISTRIBUTION. Units will be distributed to the public by Underwriters,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.  
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. During the 
initial offering period, the Sponsor and Underwriters will sell Units to        
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price  
(net of any sales charge discount) less the concession or agency commission     
shown in the following table.

1,000 Units/$1,000,000 or more.................     20             --       

 Non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other selling agents who purchase an
aggregate of 250 or more Units directly from the Sponsor during the initial     
offering period will receive a net concession equal to the net concession       
allowed to Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation"  
below. For individual transactions of less than 250 Units, the Sponsor will     
offer a rebate per Unit equal to the Volume Concession Rebate described in the  
table above so that the broker-dealer or selling agent receives the appropriate 
net concession or agency commission. The Sponsor will pay this rebate after the 
end of the initial offering period. The amounts shown in the table apply only to
IM-IT, Investment Grade Municipal, U.S. Territorial IM-IT, Long-Term State and  
National Quality Trusts. Amounts applicable to all other Trusts will be set     
forth in the Prospectus Part I for the related Trust. The breakpoints will be   
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which     
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be  
issued. Certain commercial banks may be making Units available to their         
customers on an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these       
customers (equal to the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or  
remitted to the banks. Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the  
selling dealer or agent. For secondary market transactions, the concession or   
agency commission will generally amount to 70% of the applicable sales charge.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the
purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency          
commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of the sales charge.   

SPONSOR AND UNDERWRITER COMPENSATION. The Sponsor will sell Units to  
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a gross         
concession of $35 per Unit underwritten. The net concession earned by           
Underwriters after giving effect to sales charge discounts will equal the       
amounts shown in the table below. For a list of the Underwriters that have      
purchased Units from the Sponsor, see "Underwriting" in Prospectus Part I.

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter      
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to         
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters are
eligible to receive a rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate is intended to       
reimburse Underwriters for discounts provided to such broker-dealers and agents,
and on these transactions will equal the amount by which the sum of the related 
broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the regular      
Underwriter concession. The amounts of these rebates are shown in the table     
above. In addition, if a firm commits to act as an Underwriter for a Trust, the 
concessions or agency commissions allowed will equal the amounts shown above on 
all Units of the Trust distributed during the initial offering period and       
purchased directly from the Sponsor rather than the broker-dealer concessions   
described under "Unit Distribution."                                            

The Managing Underwriters of any Investment Grade Municipal Trust or  
National Quality Trust (Underwriters who underwrite 15% of the Trust involved or
1,000 Units of such Trust, whichever is greater) will be allowed a concession of
$38.00 per Unit of any such Trust, as of the Date of Deposit. Also, any such    
Managing Underwriter that sells a total of 25% or 1,500 Units, whichever is     
greater, of any individual series of such Trusts will receive an additional     
$2.00 per each such Unit. In connection with quantity sales to purchasers of any
Pennsylvania IM-IT Trust the Underwriters will receive from the Sponsor         
commissions totalling $35.00 per Unit for any single transaction of 100 to 249  
Units, $36.00 per Unit for any single transaction of 250 to 499 Units, $37.00   
per Unit for any single transaction of 500 to 999 Units and $38.00 per Unit for 
any single transaction of 1,000 or more Units. In addition, any Underwriter that
sells a total of 25% or 1,500 Units, whichever is greater, of any Pennsylvania  
IM-IT Trust will receive an additional $2.00 per each such Unit. In addition,   
the Sponsor has entered into agreements with Advest, Inc. ("Advest") and Gruntal
& Co., LLC ("Gruntal") whereby Advest and Gruntal will receive an additional    
$2.00 per Unit in connection with a minimum commitment of 1,500 Units of any New
York IM-IT Trust. In addition, the Sponsor and J. J. B. Hilliard, W. L. Lyons,  
Inc. ("Hilliard, Lyons") have entered into an agreement under which Hilliard,   
Lyons may receive an additional $2.00 for each Unit of the Kentucky Quality     
Trust which it underwrites, provided it underwrites a minimum of 400 Units of   
such Trust. Further, each Underwriter who underwrites 1,000 or more Units in any
Trust will receive additional compensation from the Sponsor of $1.00 for each   
Unit it underwrites. The breakpoints listed herein will also be applied on a    
dollar basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be   
applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the Underwriter.                

    In addition, the Sponsor and certain Underwriters will realize a profit or
loss, as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the 
Sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. See "Portfolio" and "Notes to
Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. Underwriters may also realize profits or losses
with respect to bonds which were acquired by the Sponsor from underwriting      
syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has not participated as sole 
underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates from    
which the bonds in the Trusts were acquired. Underwriters may further realize   
profit or loss during the initial offering period as a result of possible       
fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from  
purchasers of Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed,
if any) will be retained by the Underwriters. Affiliates of an Underwriter are  
entitled to the same dealer concessions or agency commissions that are available
to the Underwriter. In addition to any other benefits Underwriters may realize  
from the sale of Units, the Sponsor will share on a pro rata basis among senior 
Underwriters (those who underwrite at least 250 Units) 50% of any gain (less    
deductions for accrued interest and certain costs) represented by the difference
between the cost of the bonds to the Sponsor and the evaluation of the bonds on 
the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor and certain of the other Underwriters will also
realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price at  
which Units are purchased and the price at which Units are resold in connection 
with maintaining a secondary market for Units and will also realize profits or  
losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased Units at a price above or     
below the purchase price.                                                       

Underwriters and broker-dealers of the Trusts, banks and/or others are
eligible to participate in a program in which such firms receive from the       
Sponsor a nominal award for each of their representatives who have sold a       
minimum number of units of unit investment trusts created by the Sponsor during 
a specified time period. In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement
other programs under which the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win
other nominal awards for certain sales efforts, or under which the Sponsor will 
reallow to any such firms that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs   
conforming to criteria established by the Sponsor, or participate in sales      
programs sponsored by the Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the total applicable 
sales charges on the sales generated by such persons at the public offering     
price during such programs. Also, the Sponsor in its discretion may from time to
time pursuant to objective criteria established by the Sponsor pay fees to      
qualifying firms for certain services or activities which are primarily intended
to result in sales of Units of the Trusts. Such payments are made by the Sponsor
out of its own assets, and not out of the assets of the Trusts. These programs  
will not change the price Unitholders pay for their Units or the amount that the
Trusts will receive from the Units sold. Approximately every eighteen months the
Sponsor holds a business seminar which is open to Underwriters that sell units  
of trusts it sponsors. The Sponsor pays substantially all costs associated with 
the seminar, excluding Underwriter travel costs. Each Underwriter is invited to 
send a certain number of representatives based on the gross number of units such
firm underwrites during a designated time period.                               

    MARKET FOR UNITS. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to,
and certain of the other Underwriters may, maintain a market for Units and offer
to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the      
aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash  
on hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges      
payable out of the Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of  
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor  
and/or the Underwriters may either discontinue all purchases of Units or        
discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not maintained   
and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will be able to  
dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the         
Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A Unitholder
who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to current   
market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of  
the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will notify the
Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the      
secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit,  
it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would       
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

WRAP FEE AND ADVISORY ACCOUNTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Units may be available for purchase in connection with "wrap fee" accounts
and other similar accounts. You should consult your financial professional to   
determine whether you can benefit from these accounts. For these purchases you  
generally only pay the portion of the sales charge that is retained by your     
Trust's Sponsor, Van Kampen Funds Inc. You should consult the "Public
Offering--General" section for specific information on this and other sales     
charge discounts.                                                               

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DISTRIBUTIONS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless a Unitholder elects
to receive semi-annual distributions. The amount and time of the first          
distribution is described in Prospectus Part I under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information". The plan of distribution selected by a Unitholder will  
remain in effect until changed. Unitholders who purchase Units in the secondary 
market will receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior  
owner. Unitholders may change their distribution plan by indicating the change  
on a card which may be obtained from the Trustee and return the card to the     
Trustee with their certificates and other documentation required by the Trustee.
Certificates should be sent by registered or certified mail to avoid their being
lost or stolen. If the card and certificate are properly presented to the       
Trustee, the change will become effective on the first day after the next       
semi-annual record date and will remain effective until changed.                

  Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee, without
interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of 
record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be distributed on
each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date.
All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. Funds in the Principal     
Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee is not       
required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or Interest Account (but
may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these   
funds) nor to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the amount  
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit. However,
should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or  
exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the   
Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record
on the related monthly record date.                                             

  Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the
second distribution date after the purchase, under the applicable plan of       
distribution.                                                                   

   REINVESTMENT OPTION. Unitholders may elect to have distributions on their
Units automatically reinvested in shares of certain Van Kampen mutual funds     
which are registered in the Unitholder's state of residence (the "Reinvestment  
Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment objectives that differ from those
of the Trusts. The prospectus relating to each Reinvestment Fund describes its  
investment policies and the procedures to follow to begin reinvestment. A       
Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds from Van Kampen   
Funds Inc. at 1 Parkview Plaza, P.O. Box 5555, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois
60181-5555.                                                                     

After becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan, each Trust       
distribution will automatically be applied on the applicable distribution date  
to purchase shares of the applicable Reinvestment Fund at a net asset value     
computed on such date. Unitholders with an existing Guaranteed Reinvestment     
Option (GRO) Program account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution 
reinvestments) may transfer their existing account into a new GRO account which 
allows purchases of Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value. Confirmations  
of all reinvestments will be mailed to the Unitholder by the Reinvestment Fund. 
A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive   
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing at least five  
days before the next distribution date. Each Reinvestment Fund, its sponsor and 
investment adviser have the right to terminate its reinvestment plan at any     
time. Unitholders of New York Trusts who are New York residents may elect to    
have distributions reinvested in shares of First Investors New York Insured Tax 
Free Fund, Inc. subject to a sales charge of $1.50 per $100 reinvested (paid to 
First Investors Management Company, Inc.).                                      

REDEMPTION OF UNITS. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units
by tender to the Trustee, at its Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay    
Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10286, of the certificates representing  
the Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of 
transfer with signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, such
as in connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of 
applicable governmental charges, if any. Redemption of Units cannot occur until 
certificates representing the Units or satisfactory indemnity have been received
by the Trustee. No later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender,
the Unitholder will receive an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption     
Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of the tender of      
Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received
by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the Evaluation Time 
on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the    
next day on which that Exchange is open and the Units will be deemed to have    
been tendered to the Trustee on that day for redemption at the Redemption Price.

Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the Trustee is required to
withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not     
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such         
regulations. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service 
and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal  
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".           

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public 
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption    
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price  
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in the Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the 
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value 
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts        
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust      
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering Price". In determining the  
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance  
maintained on the bonds in an Insured Trust unless the bonds are in default in  
payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a       
description of the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance    
obtained by the Insured Trusts, see "Public Offering--Offering Price". Accrued  
interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if 
the balance therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other      
amounts will be withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be
cancelled.                                                                      

    The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented by
the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When bonds 
are sold, the size and diversity of the Trust will be reduced. Sales may be     
required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in   
lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                                  

The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for       
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that 
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for 
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme             
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full or
partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.           

UNITS. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form unless a    
Unitholder makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in          
certificate form. Units are transferable by making a written request to the     
Trustee and, in the case of Units in certificate form, by presentation and      
surrender of the certificate to the Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by 
a written instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the     
written request, or certificate transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears
on the records of the Trustee and on the face of any certificate with the       
signature guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents         
Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a signature guaranty program accepted by the     
Trustee. The Trustee may require additional documents such as, but not limited  
to, trust instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or       
administrator or certificates of corporate authority. Certificates will be      
issued in denominations of one Unit or any multiple thereof. Although no such   
charge is now made, the Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee
for each certificate re-issued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge
that may be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, 
stolen, mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the    
Trustee of satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses
incurred. Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for         
replacement.                                                                    

REPORTS PROVIDED. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and
other receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems 
it to be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of each Trust will be
audited annually by independent certified public accountants and the report of  
the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within a         
reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will furnish  
to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a statement     
describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual Trust       
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust information. 
Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the bonds upon     
request.                                                                        

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN THE INSURED TRUSTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in each Insured Trust. An insurance
policy obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is non-cancelable and will continue
in force so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer 
is still in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held  
by the Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by   
the Trust on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has 
been paid by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any   
policy is non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so     
insured are outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The
Portfolio Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described in "Portfolio"
and the notes thereto in Prospectus Part I. The Portfolio Insurers, if any, are 
set forth in Prospectus Part I in the "Notes to Portfolio". More detailed       
information regarding insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and        
Portfolio Insurers is included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

  The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, guarantees
the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due.   
For this purpose, "when due" generally means the stated payment or maturity date
for the payment of principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer  
defaults in the payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer enters into a   
bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is accelerated, the       
affected Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the outstanding principal      
amount of the bond plus accrued interest to the date of payment and thereby     
retire the bond from the Trust prior to the bond's stated maturity date. The    
insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the  
Units. The Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance 
policy has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the bond     
(i.e., insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the      
holder) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined  
insurance premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the bond. It is 
expected that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance
only if upon exercise the Trust would receive net proceeds in excess of the sale
proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.                          

Because the bonds are insured by Portfolio Insurers or Preinsured Bond
Insurers as to the timely payment of principal and interest, when due, and on   
the basis of the various reinsurance agreements in effect, Standard & Poor's has
assigned to the Units of each Insured Trust its "AAA" investment rating. This   
rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the Date of       
Deposit and will, unless renewed, terminate at the end of such period. See      
"Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement. This rating should not  
be construed as an approval of the offering of the Units by Standard & Poor's or
as a guarantee of the market value of the Trust or of the Units.                

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of  
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At the date      
hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be 
submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the    
ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of  
insurance. The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished
by such companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio     
Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and
is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made   
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

TRUST ADMINISTRATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE SPONSOR. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The  
Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc., which is an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. The Sponsor
has its principal offices at 1 Parkview Plaza, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois
60181-5555. As of November 30, 2000, the total stockholders' equity of Van      
Kampen Funds Inc. was $161,761,917 (audited). Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your    
Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Van Kampen's employees who have   
access to information on Trust transactions to report personal securities       
transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of        
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your     
Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional information about the     
Sponsor.                                                                        

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

 TRUSTEE. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized
under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its unit investment trust  
division offices at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, telephone     
(800) 221-7668. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and examination  
by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of        
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the    
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional
information regarding the Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement,   
including the Trustee's qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the   
effect of a merger involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and
replace the Trustee. See "Additional Information".                              

PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION. The Trusts are not managed funds and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect the Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These      
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain 
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the    
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The          
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description of
circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

REPLACEMENT BONDS. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been         
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of 
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must 
be substantially identical to the Failed Bonds in terms of (i) the exemption    
from federal and state taxation, (ii) maturity, (iii) yield to maturity and     
current return, (iv) Standard & Poor's or Moody's ratings, and (v) insurance in 
an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all Unitholders of a Trust within    
five days after the acquisition of a Replacement Bond and shall make a pro rata 
distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost of the Failed Bond        
exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued interest. If Failed Bonds
are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales charge attributable to the  
Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of the Trust and distribute the principal and   
accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Bonds to the date of removal 
from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds within 30 days after removal.  
All interest paid to a Unitholder which accrued after the expected date of      
settlement for Units will be paid by the Sponsor and accordingly will not be    
treated as tax-exempt income. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated   
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current  
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be  
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in   
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                        

 AMENDMENT OF TRUST AGREEMENT. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely      
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the      
Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the
number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in      
substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in the Trust, except for  
the substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders
of any amendment.                                                               

TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the Units then    
outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of   
the original principal amount of bonds. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder 
of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any         
remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount
than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time. For 
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of 
purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share of the       
balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs,        
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

   LIMITATION ON LIABILITIES. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of
any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the   
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any 
action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not  
liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as     
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be        
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by
the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information
available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in judgment.        

FEDERAL TAX STATUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax      
consequences of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date 
of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these   
summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For     
example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a  
non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. 
In addition, this section does not describe your state or foreign taxes. As with
any investment, you should consult your own tax professional about your         
particular consequences. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service issued new   
withholding and reporting regulations effective January 1, 2001. Foreign        
investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences  
of these regulations.                                                           

ASSETS OF THE TRUSTS. Each Trust will hold various debt obligations of
state and local governmental entities. All of the assets held by a Trust        
constitute the "Trust Assets." For purposes of this federal tax discussion, it  
is assumed that the bonds constitute debt the interest on which is excluded from
gross income for federal income tax purposes.                                   

TRUST STATUS. The Trusts will not be taxed as corporations for federal
income tax purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro 
rata portion of the assets of your trust, and as such you will be considered to 
have received a pro rata share of income (e.g., accruals of market discount and 
capital gains, if any) from the Trust Assets when such income would be          
considered to be received by you if you directly owned the Trust Assets. This is
true even if you elect to have your distributions automatically reinvested into 
additional Units. In addition, the income from the Trust Assets which you must  
take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used
to pay Trust expenses (including the deferred sales charge, if any).            

EXCLUSION FROM GROSS INCOME OF INTEREST. At the respective times of   
issuance of the bonds, opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the     
exclusion of interest thereon from Federal gross income were rendered by bond   
counsel to the respective issuing authorities, based on certain representations 
and subject to compliance with certain covenants. In addition, with respect to  
State Trusts, where applicable, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered
opinions as to the exemption of interest on such bonds when held by residents of
the State in which the issuers of such bonds are located, from State income     
taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes. Neither the
Sponsor, its counsel, nor any of the Special Counsel to a Trust for State tax   
matters have made any special review for a Trust of the proceedings relating to 
the issuance of the bonds, the bases for the bond counsel opinions, or          
compliance with the covenants required for tax-exemption. The Internal Revenue  
Service (the "Service") has an ongoing program of auditing tax-exempt           
obligations to determine whether, in the view of the Service, interest on such  
tax-exempt obligations is includible in the gross income of the owners thereof  
for federal income tax purposes. It cannot be predicted whether or not the      
Service will commence an audit of any of the bonds. If an audit is commenced,   
under current procedures of the Service, Unitholders may have no right to       
participate in such procedure. If the interest on a bond should be determined to
be taxable, the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount. 
In addition, investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received 
both prior to and after the date on which interest is determined to be taxable. 

 Your pro rata share of interest on the bonds will be excluded from your
gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same extent that such       
interest would be excluded from your gross income if you directly owned the     
bonds. However, such interest may be taken into account in computing the        
alternative minimum tax, and the branch profits tax imposed on certain foreign  
corporations.                                                                   

Ownership of the Units may result in collateral federal income tax    
consequences to certain Unitholders, including, without limitation, corporations
subject to the branch profits tax, financial institutions, certain insurance    
companies, certain S corporations, individual recipients of Social Security or  
Railroad Retirement benefits and Unitholders who may be deemed to have incurred 
(or continued) indebtedness to purchase or carry tax-exempt obligations.        

If you are a "substantial user" of the facilities financed with the   
proceeds of certain bonds, or a related person to a substantial user, you will  
not be able to exclude from your gross income interest with respect to these    
bonds. "Substantial user" and "related person" are defined under federal income 
tax law.                                                                        

   For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and
corporations, interest on certain bonds is included as an item of tax           
preference. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED IN PROSPECTUS PART I FOR CERTAIN TRUSTS,  
THE TRUSTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY SUCH BONDS.                                       

  In the case of certain corporations, the alternative minimum tax depends
upon the corporation's alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI"), which is the
corporation's taxable income with certain adjustments. One of the adjustment    
items used in computing AMTI of a corporation (excluding S Corporations,        
Regulated Investment Companies, Real Estate Investment Trusts, REMICs or FASITs)
is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such corporation's "adjusted current 
earnings" over an amount equal to its AMTI (before such adjustment item and the 
alternative tax net operating loss deduction). "Adjusted current earnings"      
includes all tax-exempt interest, including interest on all of the bonds in the 
Trusts. In addition, a branch profits tax is levied on the "effectively         
connected earnings and profits" of certain foreign corporations, which include  
tax-exempt interest, such as interest on the bonds in the Trust.                

    YOUR TAX BASIS AND INCOME OR LOSS UPON DISPOSITION. If your Trust disposes
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of   
your Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain
or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your   
tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount       
received in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax basis 
in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, generally including 
sales charges, among each Trust Asset ratably according to their value on the   
date you purchase your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to
adjust your tax basis after you purchase your Units (for example, in the case of
accruals of original issue discount, market discount, premium and accrued       
interest, as discussed below).                                                  

 If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax 
brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for 
long-term gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000, with a     
holding period of more than five years.                                         

 Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine the holding period of your Units. The tax rates
for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally  
the same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however, treats     
certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.                 

    DISCOUNT, ACCRUED INTEREST AND PREMIUM ON DEBT OBLIGATIONS. Some bonds may
have been sold with original issue discount. This generally means that the bonds
were originally issued at a price below their face (or par) value. Original     
issue discount accrues on a daily basis and generally is treated as interest    
income for federal income tax purposes. Thus, the accrual of original discount  
will be excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes to the  
same extent as interest on the bonds, as discussed above. Your basis of each    
bond which was issued with original issue discount must be increased as original
issue discount accrues.                                                         

Some bonds may have been purchased by you or the Trust at a market    
discount. Market discount is generally the excess of the stated redemption price
at maturity for the bonds over the purchase price of the bond. Market discount  
can arise based on the price a Trust pays for a bond or on the price you pay for
your Units. Market discount is taxed as ordinary income. You will recognize this
income when your Trust receives principal payments on the bond, when the bond is
disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem your Units. Alternatively,  
you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues.       
Whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate your basis  
and the timing of certain interest expense deductions.                          

     Alternatively, some bonds may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any bond,      
generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable at maturity, such 
excess is considered premium. You must amortize bond premium on a constant yield
basis over the remaining term of the bond in a manner that takes into account   
potential call dates and call prices. You cannot deduct amortized bond premium  
relating to a bond. The amortized bond premium is treated as a reduction in the 
tax-exempt interest received. As bond premium is amortized, it reduces your     
basis in the bond. The tax basis reduction requirement may result in your       
realizing a taxable gain when your Units are sold or redeemed for an amount     
equal to or less than your cost.                                                

  If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a bond, you must
include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that bond. When your Trust    
receives this accrued interest, you must treat it as a return of capital and    
reduce your tax basis in the bond.                                              

 This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,   
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For      
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the          
discussion set forth above in the case of bonds that were issued with original  
issue discount.                                                                 

    EXCHANGES. If you elect to reinvest amounts received from the Trust into a
future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes, and any  
gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any loss will be treated
as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in connection with the exchange  
of your Units of your Trust for units of a future trust will generally be       
disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase, to
the extent the two trusts have substantially identical assets under the wash    
sale provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.                                   

    LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You  
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by the Trust to the same    
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may, however, be required to    
treat some or all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized       
deductions. Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized          
deductions to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. Your ability  
to deduct Trust expenses is also limited to the extent the expenses are         
allocable to tax-exempt interest from the Trust.                                

   In the opinion of special counsel to the Trusts for New York tax matters,
under existing law, each Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation   
and the income of each Trust will be treated as the income of the Unitholders   
under the income tax laws of the State and City of New York.                    

 For a discussion of the state tax status of income earned on Units of a
Trust and recent changes in Federal tax law, see Prospectus Part I. Except as   
noted therein, the exemption of interest on state and local obligations for     
Federal income tax purposes discussed above does not necessarily result in      
exemption under the income or other tax laws of any state or city. The laws of  
the several states vary with respect to the taxation of such obligations.       

EXPENSES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may       
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to     
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.     
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until   
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and           
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation, printing
and execution of the Trust Agreement and the certificates, legal and accounting 
expenses, advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial    
evaluation fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor 
at no cost to the Trusts.                                                       

     SPONSOR, SUPERVISOR, EVALUATOR AND TRUSTEE. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated     
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for     
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio   
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of  
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the     
total cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will   
receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's         
portfolio. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under    
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be 
reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its       
services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the      
Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses   
and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders.   
These fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on  
the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on       
January 1 for each year thereafter.                                             

 INSURANCE. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of each
Insured Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As 
bonds covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed  
by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the       
premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the 
right to obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent    
insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related      
bonds.                                                                          

MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any special        
custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds in a     
Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of  
the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for advancing funds  
to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may be adjusted      
periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest rates). Each    
Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement    
each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are       
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in  
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts     
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts.

 MUNICIPAL BOND RISK FACTORS

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. The types of bonds     
included in each Trust are described under "Portfolio Diversification" in the   
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" of the related Prospectus Part I.  
Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, 
failure or defect in any of the bonds.                                          

   Certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity that
are backed by the taxing power of such entity. All other bonds in the Trusts are
revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are
not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes. General obligation bonds are 
secured by the issuer's pledge of its faith, credit and taxing power for the    
payment of principal and interest. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are payable
only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities
or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific  
revenue source. There are, of course, variations in the security of the         
different bonds in a Trust, both within a particular classification and between 
classifications, depending on numerous factors.                                 

Certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from  
mortgage loans. Certain of such housing bonds may be FHA insured or may be      
single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring from   
originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences     
located within the issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate  
income. Mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to   
their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged      
premises, default, condemnation or casualty loss. Because these bonds are       
subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such     
prepayments of mortgage loans, a substantial portion of such bonds will probably
be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary 
call dates. Extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result
from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage     
loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period. Additionally,       
unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce     
revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage 
revenue bonds. These bonds were issued under Section 103A of the Internal       
Revenue Code, which Section contains certain requirements relating to the use of
the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its
tax-exempt status. In each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply
with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an      
opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from Federal income tax under  
existing laws and regulations. Certain issuers of housing bonds have considered 
various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first         
redemption dates for such bonds. In connection with the housing bonds held by a 
Trust, the Sponsor at the Date of Deposit is not aware that any of the          
respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such
bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates.                      

Certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds. Ratings of bonds   
issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that   
contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and expenses. A facility's    
gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by     
future events and conditions including, among other things, demand for services 
and the ability of the facility to provide the services required, physicians'   
confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition with other     
health care facilities, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit  
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses, the cost 
and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance, the funding of Medicare,  
Medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs, government regulation   
and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance,        
including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third party 
pay or programs.                                                                

  Certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers, including
those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas. General problems of  
such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction       
programs in an inflationary period, the limitations on operations and increased 
costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations, the difficulty of
the capital market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in obtaining fuel  
at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation. In addition,        
Federal, state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time     
review existing, and impose additional, regulations governing the licensing,    
construction and operation of nuclear power plants, which may adversely affect  
the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal
and/or interest on such bonds.                                                  

   Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived
from the sale of water and/or sewerage services. Such bonds are generally       
payable from user fees. The problems of such issuers include the ability to     
obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline resulting in      
decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large construction programs,   
the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to    
environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty of obtaining or         
discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation programs and
the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.                                    

Certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds ("IRBs"). IRBs have  
generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and 
receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular       
project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers. In some cases, a mortgage 
on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the IRBs.       
Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely dependent upon the       
creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate          
guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors    
which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company
or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, regulatory and 
environmental restrictions, litigation resulting from accidents or              
environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive competition and financial           
deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged  
buy-out, takeover or otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator 
of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's      
creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating and/or
market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of such a restructuring may
have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such     
bonds, even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or   
effected.                                                                       

   Certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of
a governmental entity (hereinafter called "lease obligations"). Lease           
obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation. Although the
lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for 
which the municipality's taxing power is pledged, a lease obligation is         
ordinarily backed by the municipality's covenant to appropriate for and make the
payments due under the lease obligation. However, certain lease obligations     
contain "non-appropriation" clauses which provide that the municipality has no  
obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated  
for such purpose on a yearly basis. A governmental entity that enters into such 
a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make
lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any 
lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor. A    
governmental entity's failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its 
lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the
obligations secured thereby. Although "non-appropriation" lease obligations are 
secured by the leased property, disposition of the property in the event of     
foreclosure might prove difficult.                                              

   Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are, or which govern
the operation of, schools, colleges and universities and whose revenues are     
derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems, from      
tuition, dormitory revenues, grants and endowments. General problems relating to
school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of       
financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes, thereby creating a    
disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools
in poor areas. Litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of
funds available for the payment of school bonds in the Trusts. General problems 
relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a        
declining percentage of the population consisting of "college" age individuals, 
possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased   
operating costs, the uncertainty of continued receipt of Federal grants and     
state funding, and government legislation or regulations which may adversely    
affect the revenues or costs of such issuers.                                   

Certain of the bonds in certain of the Trusts may be obligations which are
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of
facilities such as airports, bridges, turnpikes, port authorities, convention   
centers and arenas. The major portion of an airport's gross operating income is 
generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use    
agreements which consist of annual payments for leases, occupancy of certain    
terminal space and service fees. Airport operating income may therefore be      
affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use 
agreements. From time to time the air transport industry has experienced        
significant variations in earnings and traffic, due to increased competition,   
excess capacity, increased costs, deregulation, traffic constraints and other   
factors, and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties.   
Similarly, payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues
from the projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges 
and rents from buildings. Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by       
reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance,     
decreased use of a facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, 
scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents.                                

   Certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by
revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities. Resource   
recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste, generate steam and     
convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds may be subject to         
extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain         
circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or condemnation of a   
project; contracts relating to a project becoming void, unenforceable or        
impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of raw materials,   
operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or    
technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of 
a project; and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts        
relating to the projects void, unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose 
unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities. The Sponsor cannot predict the   
causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in a Trust    
prior to the stated maturity of the bonds.                                      

Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par 
value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on discount bonds at the time they 
were purchased and deposited in a Trust were lower than the current market      
interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type. If such    
interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase, the market discount  
of previously issued bonds will become greater, and if such interest rates for  
newly issued comparable bonds decline, the market discount of previously issued 
bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. Investors should also note that
the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster 
than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease. Conversely,
if interest rates increase, the value of bonds purchased at a market discount   
will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium. In addition, if  
interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium Securities 
and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding, discount bonds will be reduced. A
bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger     
portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and  
less in the form of tax-exempt interest income than a comparable bond newly     
issued at current market rates. See "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II. 
Market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of    
market confidence in the issue.                                                 

Certain of the bonds may be "zero coupon" bonds. Zero coupon bonds are    
purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to       
receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any    
periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep discount bonds which do   
not make current interest payments (such as the zero coupon bonds) is that a    
fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also, in effect,  
on all discount earned during the life of such obligation. This implicit        
reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to
reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield  
on the discount obligation, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability
to reinvest at higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds   
are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of       
changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which  
pay interest.                                                                   

   Certain of the bonds may have been purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or
"delayed delivery" basis. See "Notes to Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The    
delivery of any such bonds may be delayed or may not occur. Interest on these   
Bonds begins accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of
delivery. To the extent any bonds are actually delivered to a Trust after their 
respective expected dates of delivery, Unitholders who purchase their Units     
prior to the date such bonds are actually delivered to the Trustee would be     
required to adjust their tax basis in their Units for a portion of the interest 
accruing on such bonds during the interval between their purchase of Units and  
the actual delivery of such bonds. As a result of any such adjustment, the      
Estimated Current Returns during the first year would be slightly lower than    
those stated in the Prospectus which would be the returns after the first year, 
assuming the portfolio of a Trust and estimated annual expenses other than that 
of the Trustee (which may be reduced in the first year only) do not vary from   
that set forth in Prospectus Part I. Unitholders will be "at risk" with respect 
to all bonds in the portfolios including "when, as and if issued" and "delayed  
delivery" bonds (i.e., may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the  
evaluation of such bonds) from the date they commit for Units.                  

Certain of the bonds may be subject to redemption prior to their stated   
maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions, call provisions or           
extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or otherwise. A       
sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time for retirement 
of debt. A callable debt obligation is one which is subject to redemption or    
refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A refunding is a method
by which a debt obligation is redeemed, at or before maturity, by the proceeds  
of a new debt obligation. In general, call provisions are more likely to be     
exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium over par than when it
is at a discount from par. The exercise of redemption or call provisions will   
(except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for Unit 
redemptions) result in the distribution of principal and may result in a        
reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions; it may also affect
the current return on Units of the Trust involved. Each Trust portfolio contains
a listing of the sinking fund and call provisions, if any, with respect to each 
of the debt obligations. Extraordinary optional redemptions and mandatory       
redemptions result from the happening of certain events. Generally, events that 
may permit the extraordinary optional redemption of bonds or may require the    
mandatory redemption of bonds include, among others: a final determination that 
the interest on the bonds is taxable; the substantial damage or destruction by  
fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were  
used; an exercise by a local, state or Federal governmental unit of its power of
eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the    
proceeds of the bonds were used; changes in the economic availability of raw    
materials, operating supplies or facilities or technological or other changes   
which render the operation of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds   
were used uneconomic; changes in law or an administrative or judicial decree    
which renders the performance of the agreement under which the proceeds of the  
bonds were made available to finance the project impossible or which creates    
unreasonable burdens or which imposes excessive liabilities, such as taxes, not 
imposed on the date the bonds are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user 
of the proceeds of the bonds; an administrative or judicial decree which        
requires the cessation of a substantial part of the operations of the project   
financed with the proceeds of the bonds; an overestimate of the costs of the    
project to be financed with the proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess       
proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to redeem bonds; or an underestimate 
of a source of funds securing the bonds resulting in excess funds which may be  
applied to redeem bonds. The issuer of certain bonds in a Trust may have sold or
reserved the right to sell, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to     
third parties all or any portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with 
the stated redemption provisions of such bonds. In such a case the issuer no    
longer has the right to call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the  
rights from such third party. A third party pursuant to these rights may        
exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the    
issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold  
such rights. The Sponsor is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may
result in such redemption of an issue of bonds. See also the discussion of      
single family mortgage and multi-family revenue bonds above for more information
on the call provisions of such bonds.                                           

To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there is no litigation pending as of
the Date of Deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected  
to have a material adverse effect upon any of the Trusts. At any time after the 
Date of Deposit, litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with       
respect to bonds in a Trust. Such litigation, as, for example, suits challenging
the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under environmental protection  
statutes, may affect the validity of such bonds or the tax-free nature of the   
interest thereon. While the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be   
entirely predicted, each Trust has received or will receive opinions of bond    
counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of issuance to the  
effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is
exempt from Federal income tax. In addition, other factors may arise from time  
to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations 
undertaken with respect to the bonds.                                           

THE TRUSTS

   When comparing the Lehman Brothers 15-year municipal bond index to the Lehman
Brothers corporate high-yield bond index, since inception, municipal bonds have 
generally outperformed high-yield corporate bonds on a tax-adjusted basis. These
indices are not managed and do not include payment of sales charges or fees you 
would pay. If they had, results would be different. These numbers show          
historical performance only and are not meant to imply or guarantee future      
results. Bonds in which a Trust invests will be different from those used in the
indices.                                                                        

   Intermediate municipal bonds, such as those in the Strategic Municipal Trust,
Intermediate Series, may benefit investors because, historically (1) bonds with 
an intermediate maturity date have tended to be less sensitive to interest rate 
changes than those with longer maturities, (2) municipal bonds have generally   
provided lower correlation with equities than most other income investments, and
(3) intermediate municipal bond yields have generally been more stable than     
Treasury bond yields.                                                           

"Tax Freedom Day" represents the date on which the average American would 
finish paying federal, state, and local taxes if all earnings since January 1   
were turned over to fulfill annual tax obligations. The average tax payer may   
work four months before their annual tax bill is paid. Tax-free investing can   
help decrease your tax burden because municipal bonds generally provide income  
free from federal income tax and in some cases, state and local taxes. You      
should consult your tax adviser before investing.                               

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN THE INSURED TRUSTS

  Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
an Insured Trust, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior to the
deposit of such bonds in a Trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and    
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in such Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objectives and Bond Selection" in Prospectus Part II. The Portfolio     
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described under "Portfolio" and   
"Notes to Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The Portfolio Insurers are, if any,  
are set forth in the prospectus. An insurance policy obtained by an Insured     
Trust, if any, is non-cancellable and will continue in force so long as such    
Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still in business and
the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by such Trust (see       
"Portfolio" for the respective Insured Trust in Prospectus Part I). Any         
portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust, which is an obligation of such
Trust, is paid by such Trust on a monthly basis. Non-payment of premiums on a   
policy obtained by an Insured Trust will not result in the cancellation of      
insurance but will force the insurer to take action against the Trustee to      
recover premium payments due it. The Trustee in turn will be entitled to recover
such payments from such Trust. Premium rates for each issue of bonds protected  
by a policy obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, are fixed for the life of the 
Trust. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid by such      
issuer, by a prior owner of such bonds or the Sponsor and any such policy or    
policies are non-cancellable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so 
insured are outstanding and the respective Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in   
business. If the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to 
meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the         
claims-paying ability of any such insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio Insurers  
have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above
described events.                                                               

  The aforementioned portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any,
guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they  
fall due. For the purposes of insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, "when due"
generally means the stated payment or maturity date for the payment of principal
and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a bond defaults in the     
payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such issuer enters into a    
bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is accelerated, the      
affected Portfolio Insurer has the option, in its sole discretion, after        
receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default, bankruptcy         
proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such bond 
plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the bond   
from the affected Trust prior to such bond's stated maturity date. The insurance
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units.     
Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is only effective as to bonds   
owned by and held in such Trust. In the event of a sale of any such bond by the 
Trustee, such insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale.         

   Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the Trustee,
upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by  
an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to   
such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of
the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single    
predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the       
proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust is 
eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee would  
exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such exercise the 
affected Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond proceeds less the       
insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the Permanent Insurance) 
from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an     
uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for   
Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond
as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change
in the creditworthiness of each bond.                                           

The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an      
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by a Trust insurance    
policy may be sold out of the affected Trust with the benefits of the insurance 
attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the time of     
sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is not the 
case in connection with any value attributable to an Insured Trust's portfolio  
insurance). See Public Offering--Offering Price" in Prospectus Part II. Because 
any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of the bond upon   
the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option, the Sponsor   
anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be comprised of a    
substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of default, it is
much less likely that such Trust would need at some point in time to seek a     
suspension of redemptions of Units than if such Trust were to have no such      
option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in Prospectus Part II) 
and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust, if such Trust were      
holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk of default such Trust would
not need to hold such Securities until their respective maturities in order to  
realize the benefits of such Trust's portfolio insurance (see "Trust
Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement" in Prospectus Part II).         

Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no  
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of
the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right to   
obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or redemption
value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment 
of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. The value of   
the insurance will be the difference between (i) the market value of a bond     
which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk  
of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance
(less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the purchase of
Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such bonds not covered by     
Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in Prospectus Part   
II. It is also the present intention of the Trustee not to sell such bonds to   
effect redemptions or for any other reason but rather to retain them in the     
portfolio because value attributable to the insurance cannot be realized upon   
sale. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in Prospectus Part II for a more    
complete description of an Insured Trust's method of valuing defaulted bonds and
bonds which have a significant risk of default. Insurance obtained by the issuer
of a bond is effective so long as such bond is outstanding. Therefore, any such 
insurance may be considered to represent an element of market value in regard to
the bonds thus insured, but the exact effect, if any, of this insurance on such 
market value cannot be predicted.                                               

 The portfolio insurance policy or policies obtained by an Insured Trust, if
any, with respect to the bonds in such Trust were issued by one or more of the  
Portfolio Insurers. Any other Preinsured Bond insurance policy (or commitment   
therefor) was issued by one of the Preinsured Bond Insurers. See "The
Trusts--Objectives and Bond Selection" in Prospectus Part II.                   

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Effective July 14, 1997, 
AMBAC Indemnity Corporation changed its name to Ambac Assurance Corporation. The
Insurance Policy of Ambac Assurance obtained by an Insured Trust is             
noncancellable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in 
the Insurance Policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly premium is paid by 
an Insured Trust for the Insurance Policy obtained by it. The Trustee will pay, 
when due, successively, the full amount of each installment of the insurance    
premium. Pursuant to a binding agreement with Ambac Assurance, in the event of a
sale of a bond covered by the Ambac Assurance Insurance Policy, the Trustee has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance for such bond upon payment of a single  
predetermined premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond.               

   Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, Ambac Assurance agrees to pay to the
Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the bonds insured by   
Ambac Assurance which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by reason
of nonpayment by the issuer of the bonds. The term "due for payment" means, when
referring to the principal of a bond so insured, its stated maturity date or the
date on which it shall have been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption   
and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call
for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration  
or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring to interest on a     
bond, the stated date for payment of interest.                                  

 Ambac Assurance will make payment to the Trustee not later than thirty days
after notice from the Trustee is received by Ambac Assurance that a nonpayment  
of principal or of interest on a bond has occurred, but not earlier that the    
date on which the bonds are due for payment. Ambac Assurance will disburse to   
the Trustee the face amount of principal and interest which is then due for     
payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for     
delivery of bonds, not less in face amount than the amount of the payment in    
bearer form, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In   
cases where bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to   
registered holders or their assigns, Ambac Assurance shall pay principal only   
upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid bonds uncancelled and free of any 
adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment in satisfactory form,  
so as to permit ownership of such bonds to be registered in the name of Ambac   
Assurance or its nominee. In cases where bonds are issuable only in a form      
whereby interest is payable to registered holders or their assigns, Ambac       
Assurance shall pay interest only upon presentation of proof that the claimant  
is the person entitled to the payment of interest of the bonds and delivery of  
an instrument of assignment, in satisfactory form, transferring to Ambac        
Assurance all right under such bonds to receive the interest of which the       
insurance payment was made.

of the State of New York. Financial Security is licensed to engage in the       
financial guaranty insurance business in all 50 states, the District of

Financial Security and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of    
writing financial guaranty insurance, principally in respect of securities      
offered in domestic and foreign markets. Financial guaranty insurance provides a
guaranty of scheduled payments of an issuer's securities, thereby enhancing the 
credit rating of those securities, in consideration for payment of a premium to 
the insurer. Financial Security and its subsidiaries principally insure         
asset-backed, collateralized and municipal securities. Asset-backed securities  
are generally supported by residential mortgage loans, consumer or trade        
receivables, securites or other assets having an ascertainable cash flow or     
market value. Collateralized securities include public utility first mortgage   
bonds and sale/leaseback obligation bonds. Municipal securities consist largely 
of general obligation bonds, special revenue bonds and other special obligations
of state and local governments. Financial Security insures both newly issued    
securities sold in the primary market and outstanding securities sold in the    
secondary market that satisfy Financial Security's underwriting criteria.       

Financial Security is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security     
Assurance Holdings Ltd. ("Holdings"), a New York Stock Exchange listed compay.  
Major shareholders of Holdings include XL Capital Ltd. and The Tokio Marine and

Financial Security or any claim under any insurance policy issued by Financial  
Security or to make any additional contribution to the capital of Financial     
Security. As of September 30, 2001, the total policyholders' surplus and        
contingency reserves and the total unearned premium reserve, respectively, of

$784,712,000 (unaudited), and the total shareholders' equity and the unearned   
premium reserve, respectively, of Financial Security and its consolidated       
subsidiaries were, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted

Pursuant to an intercompany agreement, liabilities on financial guaranty  
insurance written or reinsured from third parties by Financial Security or its  
domestic or Bermuda operating insurance company subsidiaries are generally      
reinsured among such companies on an agreed-upon percentage substantially       
proportional to their respective capital, surplus and reserves, subject to      
applicable statutory risk limitations. In addition, Financial Security reinsures
a portion of its liabilities under certain various quota share treaties and on a
transaction-by-transaction basis. This reinsurance is used by Financial Security
as a risk management device and to comply with certain statutory and rating     
agency requirements; it does not alter on limit the obligations of Financial    
Security under any financial guaranty insurance policy.                         

 Financial Security's insurance financial strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. Financial Security's insurer financial strength is rated
"AAA" by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Standard &Poor's (Australia)

Assurance Inc. On September 30, 1997, Financial Security Assurance Inc. assumed 
all of the liabilities of FSA Maryland and sold the FSA Maryland "shell company"
to American Capital Access, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Capital Access
Holdings, Incorporated.                                                         

In order to be in an Insured Trust, bonds must be insured by one of the   
Preinsured Bond Insurers or be eligible for the insurance being obtained by such
Trust. In determining eligibility for insurance, the Preinsured Bond Insurers   
and the Portfolio Insurers have applied their own standards which correspond    
generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the insurability of
new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the criteria used in
the selection of bonds by the Sponsor. To the extent the standards of the       
Preinsured Bond Insurers and the Portfolio Insurers are more restrictive than   
those of the Sponsor, the previously stated Trust investment criteria have been 
limited with respect to the bonds. This decision is made prior to the Date of   
Deposit, as debt obligations not eligible for insurance are not deposited in an 
Insured Trust. Thus, all of the bonds in the portfolios of the Insured Trusts   
are insured either by the respective Trust or by the issuer of the bonds, by a  
prior owner of such bonds or by the Sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds  
in a Trust.                                                                     

  Because the bonds are insured by one of the Portfolio Insurers or one of the
Preinsured Bond Insurers as to the timely payment of principal and interest,    
when due, and on the basis of the various reinsurance agreements in effect,     
Standard & Poor's has assigned to the Units of each Insured Trust its "AAA"     
investment rating. Such rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months
from the Date of Deposit and will, unless renewed, terminate at the end of such 
period. See "Description of Ratings". The obtaining of this rating by an Insured
Trust should not be construed as an approval of the offering of the Units by    
Standard & Poor's or as a guarantee of the market value of such Trust or of the 
Units.                                                                          

   An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is to obtain
a higher yield on the portfolio of such Trust than would be available if all the
bonds in such portfolio had Standard & Poor's "AAA" rating and yet at the same  
time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest and      
principal, when due, on the bonds. There is, of course, no certainty that this  
result will be achieved. Preinsured Bonds in an Insured Trust (all of which are 
rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's) may or may not have a higher yield than       
uninsured bonds rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's. In selecting such bonds for an
Insured Trust, the Sponsor has applied the criteria hereinbefore described.     

  In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in respect of
a bond, a Portfolio Insurer shall make such payment after the respective insurer
has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened (but not   
earlier than the date such payment is due). The insurer, as regards any payment 
it may make, will succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect thereof. All  
policies issued by the Portfolio Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are  
substantially identical insofar as obligations to an Insured Trust are          
concerned.                                                                      

   The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter ruling which holds in effect
that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal   
obligations paid to holders of insured bonds, under policy provisions           
substantially identical to the policies described herein, will be excludable    
from Federal gross income under Section 103(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code  
to the same extent as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal 
obligations. Holders of Units in an Insured Trust should discuss with their tax 
advisers the degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling.     
However, Chapman and Cutler, counsel for the Sponsor, has given an opinion to   
the effect such payment of proceeds would be excludable from Federal gross      
income to the extent described under "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of      
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder at some
time in the future. At the date hereof, it is reported that no claims have been 
submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which
would materially impair the ability of any such company to meet its commitment  
pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio insurance.                        

   The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished by such
companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio Insurer     
appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is     
subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made      
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION

   The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units tendered
by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be   
available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee in its 
sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such bonds,  
will consider a variety of factors including (a) interest rates, (b) market     
value and (c) marketability. The Sponsor, in connection with the Quality Trusts 
and Investment Grade Municipal Trusts, may direct the Trustee to dispose of     
bonds if the Supervisor determines that there exists any default in payment of  
principal or interest, institution of certain legal proceedings, default under  
other documents adversely affecting debt service, default in payment of         
principal or interest or other obligations of the same issuer, decline in       
projected income pledged for debt service on revenue bonds or decline in price  
or occurrence of other market or credit factors, including advance refunding    
(i.e., the issuance of refunding securities and the deposit of the proceeds     
thereof in trust or escrow to retire the refunded securities on their respective
redemption dates), so that in the opinion of the Supervisor the retention of    
such bonds would be detrimental to the interest of the Unitholders. In          
connection with the Insured Trusts to the extent that bonds are sold which are  
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption        
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve 
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, the overall quality  
of the bonds remaining in such Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. Except  
as described in this section and in certain other unusual circumstances for     
which it is determined by the Trustee to be in the best interests of the        
Unitholders or if there is no alternative, the Trustee is not empowered to sell 
bonds from an Insured Trust which are in default in payment of principal or     
interest or in significant risk of such default and for which value has been    
attributed for the insurance obtained by such Insured Trust. Because of         
restrictions on the Trustee under certain circumstances, the Sponsor may seek a 
full or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units in 
an Insured Trust. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in Prospectus
Part II. The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to  
dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.                         

 The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new obligations in exchange or           
substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except   
that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or  
to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if 
(1) the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written    
opinion of the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such    
bond in the reasonably foreseeable future. Any obligation so received in        
exchange or substitution will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and   
conditions of the Trust Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally        
deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of obligations in      
exchange or substitution for underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give  
notice thereof to each Unitholder of the Trust thereby affected, identifying the
bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor. Except as stated herein and
under "Trust Administration--Replacement Bonds" in Prospectus Part II regarding 
the substitution of Replacement Bonds for Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a    
Trust of any securities other than the bonds initially deposited is not         
permitted.                                                                      

If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bonds occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefor within 30 days, the Trustee is    
required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the    
Trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within 30 days after notification by the  
Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell  
the defaulted bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby       
incurred.

access to information on Trust transactions to report personal securities       
transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of        
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your     
Trust. (This paragraph relates only to the Sponsor and not to the Trust or to   
any other Series thereof. The information is included herein only for the       
purpose of informing investors as to the financial responsibility of the Sponsor
and its ability to carry out its contractual obligations. More detailed         
financial information will be made available by the Sponsor upon request.)      

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

 TRUSTEE INFORMATION

   The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under the laws
of New York. The Bank of New York has its unit investment trust division offices
at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, telephone (800) 221-7668. The  
Bank of New York is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent
of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal     
Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance   
Corporation to the extent permitted by law.                                     

The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not 
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.  
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of  
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such       
records shall include the name and address of, and the certificates issued by   
the Trusts to, every Unitholder of the Trusts. Such books and records shall be  
open to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual   
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from 
time to time be required under any applicable state or Federal statute, rule or 
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the bonds held in the Trusts.                   

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has      
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee 
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes    
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or    
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any        
corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be          
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to  
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee   
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or  
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided   
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

TERMINATION OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT

   A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the
Units of such Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of such   
Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the original 
principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the     
event that a sufficient number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption
by the Underwriters, including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of such Trust 
would be reduced to less than 40% of the initial principal amount of such Trust.
If a Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the       
Underwriters, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire     
sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement provides that each     
Trust shall terminate upon the redemption, sale or other disposition of the last
bond held in such Trust, but in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the
year preceding the fiftieth anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of an
IM-IT, an Investment Grade Municipal, an IM-IT Discount, a U.S. Territorial     
IM-IT, a Long-Term State or a National Quality Trust, or beyond the end of the  
year preceding the twentieth anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of  
Strategic Municipal, IM-IT Limited Maturity, IM-IT Intermediate, State          
Intermediate Laddered Maturity and IM-IT Short Intermediate Trust. In the event 
of termination of any Trust, written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee 
to each Unitholder of such Trust at his address appearing on the registration   
books of a Trust maintained by the Trustee. Within a reasonable time thereafter 
the Trustee shall liquidate any bond then held in such Trust and shall deduct   
from the funds of such Trust any accrued costs, expenses or indemnities provided
by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of the Trustee and     
costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide for       
payment of any applicable taxes or other government charges. The sale of bonds  
in the Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than might otherwise 
be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For this reason, among 
others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination may be less than   
the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the Units held by    
such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each Unitholder his share 
of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With such distribution   
the Unitholder shall be furnished a final distribution statement of the amount  
distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall         
determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it shall    
make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.                    

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with final distributions to  
Unitholders of an Insured Trust, it should be noted that because the portfolio  
insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is applicable only while bonds so insured
are held by such Trust, the price to be received by such Trust upon the         
disposition of any such bond which is in default, by reason of nonpayment of    
principal or interest, will not reflect any value based on such insurance.      
Therefore, in connection with any liquidation, it shall not be necessary for the
Trustee to, and the Trustee does not currently intend to, dispose of any bond or
bonds if retention of such bond or bonds, until due, shall be deemed to be in   
the best interest of Unitholders, including, but not limited to, situations in  
which a bond or bonds so insured have deteriorated market prices resulting from 
a significant risk of default. Since the Preinsured Bonds will reflect the value
of the related insurance, it is the present intention of the Sponsor not to     
direct the Trustee to hold any of such Preinsured Bonds after the date of       
termination. All proceeds received, less applicable expenses, from insurance on 
defaulted bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will ultimately be   
distributed to Unitholders of record as of such date of termination as soon as  
practicable after the date such defaulted bond or bonds become due and          
applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the Trustee.                

DESCRIPTION OF RATINGS

STANDARD & POOR'S, A DIVISION OF THE MCGRAW-HILL COMPANIES. A Standard &  
Poor's municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness of 
an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This assessment of       
creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors,       
insurers or lessees.                                                            

The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security,   
inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price.                             

 The ratings are based on current information furnished to Standard & Poor's
by the issuer and obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers 
reliable. The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of     
changes in, or unavailability of, such information.                             

 The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations:

   I.   Likelihood of default--capacity and willingness of the obligor as to
the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in
accordance with the terms of the obligation.                

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

  III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
       the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under
      the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

AAA--This is the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt   
obligation and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and      
interest.                                                                       

   AA--Bonds rated AA also qualify as high-quality debt obligations. Capacity to
pay principal and interest is very strong, and in the majority of instances they
differ from AAA issues only in small degree.                                    

A--Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest,    
although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions.                                          

BBB--Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay   
interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection 
parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more      
likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for   
debt in this category than in higher rated categories.                          

Plus (+) or Minus (-): To provide more detailed indications of credit     
quality, the ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by the addition of a    
plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.

Provisional Ratings: A provisional rating ("p") assumes the successful    
completion of the project being financed by the issuance of the bonds being     
rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or     
entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project.    
This rating, however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion, 
makes no comment on the likelihood of, or the risk of default upon failure of,  
such completion. Accordingly, the investor should exercise his own judgment with
respect to such likelihood and risk.                                            

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. A brief description of the applicable 
Moody's rating symbols and their meanings follows:                              

  Aaa--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be the best quality. They carry
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt   
edge". Interest payments are protected by a large, or by an exceptionally       
stable, margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements   
are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to    
impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues. With the occasional    
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances, the safety of obligations  
of this class is so absolute that their market value is affected solely by money
market fluctuations.                                                            

Aa--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all      
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as
high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of   
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of          
protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements  
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa       
securities. These Aa bonds are high grade, their market value virtually immune  
to all but money market influences, with the occasional exception of oversupply 
in a few specific instances.                                                    

 A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and
are to be considered as higher medium grade obligations. Factors giving security
to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present  
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future. The market 
value of A-rated bonds may be influenced to some degree by credit circumstances 
during a sustained period of depressed business conditions. During periods of   
normalcy, bonds of this quality frequently move in parallel with Aaa and Aa     
obligations, with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific      
instances.                                                                      

Baa--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations;
i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments   
and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective   
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in   
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic  
rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the bond ranks at the high 
end of its category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the      
modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating
category.                                                                       

  Con--Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or
the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally. These are bonds      
secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction, (b) earnings of projects
unseasoned in operating experience, (c) rentals which begin when facilities are 
completed, or (d) payments to which some other limiting condition attaches.     
Parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of         
construction or elimination of basis of condition.                              

EQUIVALENT TAXABLE ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN TABLES

As of the date of the Prospectus Part I, the following tables show the    
approximate taxable estimated current returns for individuals that are          
equivalent to tax-exempt estimated current returns under combined Federal and   
State taxes (where applicable) using the published marginal Federal and State   
tax rates (where applicable) scheduled to be in effect in 2002. These tables    
illustrate approximately what you would have to earn on taxable investments to  
equal the tax-exempt estimated current return in your income tax bracket. The   
tables assume that Federal taxable income is equal to State income subject to   
tax, and for cases in which more than one State rate falls within a Federal     
bracket, the State rate corresponding to the highest income within that Federal 
bracket is used. The combined State and Federal tax rates shown reflect the fact
that State tax payments are currently deductible for Federal tax purposes. The  
tables do not reflect any local taxes, any alternative minimum taxes or any     
taxes other than personal income taxes. The tables do not show the approximate  
taxable estimated current returns for individuals that are subject to the       
alternative minimum tax. The taxable equivalent estimated current returns may be
somewhat higher than the equivalent returns indicated in the following tables   
for those individuals who have adjusted gross incomes in excess of $137,300. The
tables do not reflect the effect of Federal or State limitations (if any) on the
amount of allowable itemized deductions or the phase-outs of personal or        
dependent exemption credits or any other credits. These limitations were        
designed to phase out certain benefits of these deductions and credits for      
higher income taxpayers. These limitations, in effect, raise the current maximum
marginal Federal tax rate to approximately 43.5 percent for taxpayers filing a  
joint return and entitled to four personal exemptions and to approximately 39.8 
percent for taxpayers filing a single return entitled to only one personal      
exemption. These limitations are subject to certain maximums, which depend on   
the number of exemptions claimed and the total amount of taxpayer's itemized    
deductions. For example, the limitation on itemized deductions will not cause a 
taxpayer to lose more than 80% of his allowable itemized deductions, with       
certain exceptions. See "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II for a more   
detailed discussion of Federal tax legislation.

A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current returns 
with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in   
making an investment decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its         
advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on   
the Trusts and returns over specified periods on other similar Van Kampen       
sponsored unit investment trusts with inflation rates and with returns on       
taxable investments such as corporate or U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and    
money market accounts or money market funds, each of which has investment       
characteristics that may differ from those of the Trusts. U.S. Government bonds,
for example, are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. 
Money market accounts and money market funds provide stability of principal, but
pay interest at rates that vary with the condition of the short-term debt       
market. The investment characteristics of the Trusts are described more fully in
the prospectus.                                                                 

FLORIDA RISK FACTORS

  Economic Outlook. Florida's economy is not only expected to perform well but
is projected to continue outperforming the U.S. Total non-farm jobs are expected
to increase 3.8% in 2000-2001, and 2.8% in 2001-2002, reaching more than 7.5    
million in the latter fiscal year. Trade and services account for more than half
of all non-farm jobs. Service jobs are forecasted to grow 6.7% in 2000-2001, and
4.7% in 2001-2002. Trade jobs are expected to grow 2.6% and 2.3% in 2000-2001   
and 2001-2002, respectively. Florida's unemployment rate is expected to be 3.8% 
and 4.3% for the same periods.                                                  

An important element of Florida's economic outlook is the construction    
sector. Florida's single and multi-family private housing starts are projected  
to slow over the next two years. From a combined total of 162,600 housing starts
in 1999-2000, it is expected that housing starts will fall to a combined total  
of 143,700 units in 2000-2001. Starts should slightly recover the following     
year, gaining 146,100 units. Multi-family starts have been slow to recover from 
the early 1990's recession, but they are showing strength, adding 58,800 starts 
in 1998-1999, 63,900 in 1999-2000, 49,900 in 2000-2001, and a projected increase
of 52,000 units in 2001-2002. Single-family starts are forecasted to be 93,800  
in 2000-2001, and 94,100 units the following year. Total construction           
expenditures are expected to increase by 1.6 and 2.7% during these forecast     
horizon periods.                                                                

Florida's strong population growth contributes to the performance of      
Florida's economy. In addition to attracting senior citizens to Florida as a    
place for retirement, Florida is also recognized as attracting a significant    
number of individuals of working age (18-64). In recent years, Florida's prime  
working age population (18 - 44) has grown at an average annual rate of more    
than 2.0%. More than 60% of Florida's total population is at the working age (18
- 64). This share is not expected to change appreciably into the twenty-first   
century.                                                                        

From a 3.7% growth rate in real personal income in 1999-2000, it is       
forecasted that Florida's real personal income will increase 5.1% in 2000-2001  
and 4.6% in 2001-2002. During these periods, real personal income per capita is 
expected to grow 3.4 and 2.9%, respectively. However, using personal income to  
compare Florida to other states can be misleading because Florida's personal    
income is systematically underestimated. Current contributions by employers to  
pension plans are included in personal income, while payments from pension plans
are excluded to avoid double accounting. Because Florida retirees are more      
likely to be collecting on benefits earned in another state, Florida personal   
income is underestimated as a result.                                           

Because Florida has a proportionately greater retirement age population,  
property income (dividends, interest, and rent) and transfer payments (Social   
Security and pension benefits, among other sources of income) are relatively    
more important sources of income. Transfer payments are typically less sensitive
to the business cycle than employment income and act as stabilizing forces in   
weak economic periods.                                                          

Revenues and Expenditures. Governmental funds include general, special    
revenue, capital projects and debt service funds. Revenues are recognized when  
they are both measurable and available to finance current expenditures. Revenues
for governmental funds totaled $39.7 billion in fiscal year 2000, an increase of
7.0% over the previous year. Expenditures for governmental fund types totaled   
$37.7 billion in fiscal year 2000, a 7.4% increase from the previous year.      

Total fund balance at June 30, 2000, for all governmental fund types, was 
$10.57 billion compared to $10.92 billion at June 30, 1999. Of the June 30, 2000
fund balance, $6.47 billion represents unreserved fund balance which is $520    
million more than the $5.95 billion last year.                                  

 Florida's 1997 tobacco settlement, as amended in 1998, is expected to total
approximately $13 billion over a 25 year period. The settlement anticipates that
the State of Florida will use the funds for children's health care coverage and 
other health-related services, to reimburse the State of Florida for medical    
expenses incurred by the State, and for mandated improvements in State          
enforcement efforts regarding the reduction of sales of tobacco products to     
minors. Additionally, the funds may be used for such purposes as the State match
required to draw federal funds to provide children's health care coverage and   
for enhancement of children's and adolescents' substance abuse services,        
substance abuse prevention and intervention and children's mental health        
services. As of June 30, 2000, the State had received approximately $1.6 billion
of the settlement, including $641 million received in the 1999-2000 fiscal year.

   Debt Management. Florida's Constitution and statutes require that Florida not
run a deficit in its budget as a whole, or in any separate fund within its      
budget. Rather, its budget and funds must be kept in balance from currently     
available revenues each fiscal year. If the Governor or Comptroller believes a  
deficit will occur in any fund, by statute, he must certify his opinion to the  
Administrative Commission, which then is authorized to reduce all Florida agency
budgets and releases by a sufficient amount to prevent a deficit in any fund.   
Additionally, the Florida Constitution prohibits Florida from borrowing by      
issuing bonds to fund its operations.                                           

Florida's outstanding general obligation bonds at June 30, 2000, totaled  
approximately $9.5 billion and were issued to finance capital outlay for        
educational projects of local school districts, community colleges and state    
universities, environmental protection and highway construction.                

 Litigation. Currently under litigation are several issues relating to state
actions or state taxes that put at risk a portion of General Revenue Fund       
monies. There is no assurance that any of such matters, individually or in the  
aggregate, will not have a material adverse affect on the state's financial     
position.                                                                       

Bond Ratings. Florida maintains a high bond rating from Moody's Investors 
Services (Aa2) and Standard and Poor's Corporation (AA+) on all State general   
obligation bonds. There can be no assurance that such ratings will be maintained
in the future. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations      
issued by local Florida issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of     
obligations issued by the State of Florida, and that there is no obligation on  
the part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of 
default.                                                                        

Each Florida Trust is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Florida municipal obligations. These include the   
possible adverse effects of certain Florida constitutional amendments,          
legislative measures, voter initiatives and other matters. The information      
provided is only a brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial 
situation in Florida and is derived from sources that are generally available to
investors and are believed to be accurate. No independent verification has been 
made of the accuracy or completeness of any of the preceding information. It is 
based in part on information obtained from various State and local agencies in  
Florida or contained in Official Statements for various Florida bonds.          

 ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS TO UNITHOLDERS

The tables below set forth the per Unit estimated monthly and semi-annual 
distributions of interest and principal to Unitholders. The tables assume no    
changes in expenses, no changes in the current interest rates, no exchanges,    
redemptions, sales or prepayments of the underlying bonds prior to maturity or  
expected retirement date and the receipt of principal upon maturity or expected 
retirement date. To the extent the foregoing assumptions change actual          
distributions will vary.
