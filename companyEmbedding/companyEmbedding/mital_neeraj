Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

PenFed Credit Union


                                            Applied for a credit card and was denied based on what they said was a loss from a personal loan in 1978. I have never had an account with PenFed, so I questioned the accuracy of this denial. Considering, as a business owner, my scores are well north of 700, I thought this...show more

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Blackstone Corporate Private Equity


                  Blackstone Corporate Private Equity employs a flexible, opportunistic investment approach that is not focused on any single geography, industry, transaction structure or size. The firm has expertise across all aspects of the capital markets including debt, equity, real estate financing, derivatives and commodities. They focus on situations where their investment can facilitate value-creating strategic transformations of businesses. Their transactions may include large public-to-privates, large private transactions, small and medium sized buyouts, distressed investments, rescue financings, platform build-ups, industry consolidations, minority stakes, structured equity, growth equity and start-ups. Blackstone deploys capital globally over the life of a fund and across a variety of investment environments. Most of Blackstone's investments are in the US, Europe, China and India. Blackstone has significant expertise in all major industries. One of Blackstone's signature forms of private equity investing is corporate partnership transactions in which they invest capital alongside a major corporation.Blackstone tends to be a contrarian private equity investor, focusing on out-of-favor, under-appreciated industries. The firm has successfully invested in industries such as rural telephony, oil refining, commodity chemicals, coal and automotive parts, among others, when they were perceived to be out-of-favor with the markets. The firm also seeks to identify developing industry trends, to capitalize on those trends before they become widely appreciated and to pursue opportunities to change the structure and profit potential of specific industry sectors through consolidation.Blackstone also focuses on investments in distressed securities. Through their restructuring and reorganization advisory business and their GSO credit-oriented business, the firm has access to investment opportunities in companies in financial distress that are trading at significant discounts.
