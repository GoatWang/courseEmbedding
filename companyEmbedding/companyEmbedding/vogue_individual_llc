Concept


                            Created by a visionary Emperor based on a design by an Italian architect, St. Petersburg, Russia’s window on the West and door to the East, has always been a centre for economic and cultural activity as well as a laboratory for urban and architectural projects. With its bright metal frame combined with the warmth of the wood and leather, Vogue desks are leading players in this scenario, in harmony with tradition and innovation with an irresistibly prestigious grain.
