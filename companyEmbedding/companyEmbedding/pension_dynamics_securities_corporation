Whether you are a small start-up company, a non-profit organization or a plan sponsor spending too much time managing your retirement plan, Pension Dynamics will design a plan that fits your needs, now and in the future
















We are innovative and creative when it comes to designing and improving retirement plans, offering the entire universe of top Morningstar rated mutual funds for:




401(k) Retirement Plans
Our full-service 401(k) retirement plans are custom designed to meet your company’s needs.  Your plan can have a Safe Harbor option that eliminates the need for nondiscrimination testing. We can set up your plan with traditional pre-tax contributions, Roth after-tax contributions and Self-Directed Accounts to enhance employee benefits and offer more investment choices.


403(b) Retirement Plans
These tax-advantaged retirement savings plans are available for public education organizations, 501(c)(3) non-profit employers, cooperative hospital service organizations and self-employed ministers in the United States. Our customized, full-service 403(b) retirement plans can be designed with a Safe Harbor provision and Roth options. 


457(b) Retirement Plans
These tax-advantaged deferred-compensation retirement plans are for employees of public schools, universities, charities, certain state and local governments, and non-governmental entities that are tax exempt. Eligible employees can defer a portion of their salary into the plan on a pre-tax basis.




Defined Benefit Plans
We can help you develop and maintain employer-provided retirement plans that guarantees participants a retirement income. Plan sponsors pay into the plan on behalf of participants and decide where to invest plan assets. Plan benefits are based on specific age and service requirements.


Cash Balance Plans
Especially attractive to professional service firms with partners or owners who want to maximize their tax-sheltered retirement income and tax-deductible contributions, a cash balance plan may be just what your company is looking for. Benefits are defined as a stated account balance with participants credited with a pay credit and interest credit annually. Retirement benefits are typically payable as a lump sum or lifetime annuity.
