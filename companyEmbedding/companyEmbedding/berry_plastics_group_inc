(NYSE:BERY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO¬ªBerry Plastics: Buy The Products Or The Stock?May.18.13 | About: Berry Plastics (BERY) Jenks Jumps Growth at reasonable price, long-term horizon, valueImagine a customer list including household names like Dannon, Dean Foods (NYSE:DF), ConAgra (NYSE:CAG), Kraft (KRFT), Kroger (NYSE:KR), Unilever (NYSE:UL), Hardee's, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Subway, Wendy's (NYSE:WEN), Yum! (NYSE:YUM), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), McCormick (NYSE:MKC), Bayer, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Shell Oil, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), Wyeth (owned by Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)), Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), S.C. Johnson, Perrigo (NASDAQ:PRGO), CVS (NYSE:CVS), Target (NYSE:TGT), L'Oreal, Avon (NYSE:AVP), Tyco Electronics (NYSE:TYC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), True Value, Ace, Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). In fact, imagine a customer list with over 13,000 business names. Factor in a respectable degree of customization for each customer making the prospect of that customer abandoning the business relationship expensive. It could even be substantiated that this company can well be the difference between a consumer's purchase of its customers' products or not. That's a company definitely worth a second look for a long-term investor.
Berry Plastics (NYSE:BERY) began trading on the NYSE in October 2012. But, the company has been in business since 1967. Berry provides plastic consumer-packaging and engineered materials. It operates in four segments: Rigid Open Top, Rigid Closed Top, Engineered Materials and Flexible Packaging. Revenue is spread somewhat evenly across the four segments at $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $700 million respectively (based on the trailing twelve months). As well, no single customer represents more than 3% of revenue. According to the 2012 annual report, even the top ten customers represent only 17% of revenue. Products include containers, closures, bottles, prescription vials, tubes, drink cups, plates, bowls, pitchers, flowerpots, closures, overcaps, spouts, spice containers, tapes, stretch films, foodservice films, liners, drop cloths, trash bags, and the like. Custom solutions for medical applications, anti-corrosion applications, the oil and gas industry and the construction industry are niche markets.

Key to its operations are a vast product library of proprietary and customer-specific molds, patents, and technologies. Besides production, Berry offers conceptual design, graphic arts services and a full roster of decorating options including all types of labeling, hot-stamping and screen printing. The breadth and depth of its services are what would make switching suppliers difficult, time-consuming and costly for its customers. Still, Berry prides itself on staying on the forefront of technology for the benefit of its customers. It also strives to minimize costs for its customers by such activities as being a major purchaser of raw materials and by employing packing technologies to minimize shipping and warehousing costs. Berry recognizes that packaging is a significant value-add to consumer products relative to form, function and branding. Demands in the industry include brand recognition, improvement in safety and convenience, new and improved functionality, barrier protection, thermal management, incorporation of track-and-trace technology and environmental friendliness.
According to The Deal Pipeline, the packaging industry raked in $670 billion in 2010 and is expected to grow to $820 billion by 2016. Of the 2010 total, 40% or $274 billion went to plastics. As evidence of the growth of the plastics segment of the packaging industry, in 2005, plastics represented 30% of the industry and in 2006, 34%. The whole industry has been in a consolidation stage for some time, starting with a record year in 2006. In 2011, there were 114 merger and acquisition transactions in the industry. Earlier this month, five packaging companies in North America and Europe merged to form the sixth largest packaging company in the world. Attractive candidates for acquisition typically offer new technology or solutions to a niche market or expansion into a new locality.
Berry does 93% of its business domestically from over 80 locations in the United States. The majority of locations are a result of acquisition. In 24 years, Berry acquired 35 companies, including 12 since 2006. And, as a result, it has manufacturing facilities in Mexico, India, the Netherlands and Belgium, Germany, Australia, Brazil and Malaysia. During the first quarter of 2013, Berry made its first capital investment in Brazil.

Packaging is primarily a local process. Empty containers are not usually shipped internationally. So, Berry set further international growth as a short-term goal. Its focus is on high-GDP-growth areas such as Latin America, Asia and Brazil. However, it is tracking well behind the world's largest plastics-packaging company, Australian-based Amcor, with a $12 billion market cap and 300 operations sites in 42 countries. Competitors Sonoco Products (NYSE:SON) with 347 sites in 34 countries and Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE) with 145 sites in 62 countries are also well ahead of Berry relative to international presence.
With a well-established domestic business and reputation and a possibility of international growth, there are compelling reasons to stock up on Berry Plastics. Analysts have given Berry one of the largest estimates for long-term growth in the industry at 17.33%. Berry claims to outpace all its competitors regarding EBITDA margins at 17.4%.
Yet, Berry has a looming and haunting challenge - debt. With only $16 million in cash and $4 billion in long-term debt, Berry carries the risk of not being able to expand through acquisition. It does have borrowing capacity of $518 million but the ability to incur additional debt could be limited. Cash flow must be first directed to its indebtedness. For 2013, Berry budgeted $230 million for new products, organic growth and international expansion.
To its credit, Berry has reducing leverage as one of its four key initiatives. In February, Berry refinanced some of its debt to decrease annual interest expense which resulted in credit ratings upgrades. In the six months between its fiscal year-end in September 2012 and second quarter reporting in March 2013, it decreased its debt obligation by over 10%. But, to rely on that as a trend is unsettling when one reviews the past few years' performance. In three of the last 5 years (2008, 2010, 2011), Berry incurred an annual loss. The profit in 2012 was just $3 million or $0.02 per share.
It's not that the packaging industry tends to be debt-free and Berry Plastics, alone, has a challenge. Rather the industry, on average, carries a long-term debt to equity ratio of well over 100 at 137. By definition, the higher the ratio, the more risky the stock. Some experts recommend caution when the calculation results in a ratio over 40. Considering Berry has negative shareholder equity just makes the situation even more worrisome.

There is no denying that Berry's customer list impressively attracts investment interest. There's also no denying its debt and recent losses have the ability to depressively repel interest. If that same debt level impairs its ability to expand organically or internationally, Berry's growth potential could be repressed. Until that debt level decreases, long-term investors leery of risk should probably just buy the products rather than the stock.

Updated ‚Äî Berry Plastics Group Inc. is changing its name and adopting a new logo in a move that is both a nod to the company‚Äôs past and a look toward the future.
The Evansville, Ind.-based company will become Berry Global Group Inc. April 13, and is already using the new logo.
Changes, which include a new set of company values and mission statement, have been in the works since last fall when Tom Salmon became chief operating officer in anticipation of succeeding Jon Rich as CEO in February.
‚ÄúFor those of us who have been with the company for a while, it really represents who we are today. It‚Äôs just a fresh, clean look,‚Äù Salmon said in a telephone interview from Geneva, Switzerland, where the company unveiled the moves April 3. ‚ÄúYou have to look at it comprehensively between the name change, the mission and the core values.‚Äù
Berry now has 90 domestic and 41 international locations is looking to follow customers to different parts of the world as they continue to expand. But the company will not grow for growth‚Äôs sake, the CEO said.
‚ÄúThe majority of our business resides in North America. It‚Äôs incredibly important to us. It‚Äôs always going to be an incredibly important region to us. But we also have to make certain that we‚Äôve got the ability to deliver value internationally as well. And that is definitely aspirational for us. We‚Äôre going to be very smart about that. We‚Äôre going to do that in a methodical, measured way. But our end customers expect it,‚Äù Salmon said.
A 2015 acquisition of nonwovens maker Avintiv Inc., with operations in 14 countries, helped broaden Berry‚Äôs international geography.
‚ÄúThere is opportunity where customers want to take advantage of those core values that Berry represents. We feel that our business has to reflect the opportunities that exist in other regions of the world. We‚Äôre going to be prudent in evaluating those opportunities and making certain that it makes sense for our end customers but also our shareholders,‚Äù Salmon said.
Virtually all of Berry‚Äôs products use plastics ‚Äúin one way or another,‚Äù Salmon said, and the CEO does not believe eliminating the word ‚Äúplastics‚Äù from the company‚Äôs name will have any impact.

        Salmon
    

‚ÄúPlastics remain incredibly important to us. It‚Äôs a core competency of ours. It‚Äôs always going to be. But we didn‚Äôt want to limit our thinking. We didn‚Äôt want to limit it to that substrate in and of itself. And we just felt that what‚Äôs important is ‚ÄòBerry.‚Äô People know who we are,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what people always refer to us as in the marketplace, ‚ÄòBerry.‚Äô They never use ‚ÄòBerry Plastics,‚Äô‚Äù Salmon said. ‚ÄúI think this captures the essence of who we‚Äôve been and who we really are.‚Äù
Aside from the name change, the company also has adopted a mission statement: ‚ÄúAlways advancing to protect what‚Äôs important.‚Äù
The new logo features a diamond shaped icon in the upper right hand corner consisting of four parts, each of a different color. Those sections represent the company‚Äôs new values of partnerships, excellence, growth and safety.
These values, Salmon said, are high standards. ‚ÄúBut they are standards we expect to achieve and deliver on those commitments and those promises to our customers every day.‚Äù
Berry also is changing the name of a wholly owned subsidiary from Berry Plastics Corp. to Berry Global Inc.
The company unveiled the changes in conjunction with Index 17 in Geneva, which bills itself as the world‚Äôs largest nonwovens exhibition.
Berry is now a $7 billion company with more than 130 locations, a far cry from the single-location business in Evansville with less than $25 million in annual sales in 1983 when the company became Berry Plastics, Salmon said.
‚ÄúWe think this is a fresh look for our company,‚Äù Salmon said about the changes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited. The company is poised and this is a great opportunity.‚Äù

Headquarters


Berry Global, Inc is a global manufacturer and marketer of plastic packaging products. Headquartered in Evansville, Indiana,[2] the company operates over 130 global manufacturing facilities and employed over 25,000 individuals as of the end of financial Year 2012.[3] In April 2017, the name of the company was changed to Berry Global, Inc. [4]
History[edit]
Berry was originally established in 1967 as Imperial Plastics. In recent years, Berry has completed several acquisitions including Mammoth Containers, Sterling Products, Tri-Plas, Alpha Products, PackerWare, Venture Packaging, Virginia Design Packaging, Container Industries, Knight Engineering and Plastics, Cardinal Packaging, Poly-Seal, Landis Plastics, Euromex Plastics S.A. de C.V., Kerr Group, Covalence Specialty Materials (the former Tyco Plastics & Adhesives business),[5][6] Rollpak, Captive Plastics,[7] MAC Closures, Superfos, and the Pliant Corporation.
Landis Plastics, Inc. was based in Chicago Ridge, Illinois, with five domestic facilities supporting North American customers, manufacturing injection molded and thermoformed plastic packaging for dairy and other food products. Landis had experienced robust organic sales growth of 10.4%(1) over its last 15 years, before its purchase by Berry Plastics in 2003. During 2002, Landis generated $211.6 million of net sales.
In September 2011, Berry Plastics acquired 100% of the capital stock of Rexam SBC for an aggregate purchase price of $351 million ($340 million, net of cash acquired), financing the purchase with cash on hand and existing credit facilities. Rexam produces rigid packaging, notably plastic closures, fitments and dispensing closure systems, and jars. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, accordingly allocating the purchase price to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date.[3]
In July 2015, Berry Plastics announced plans to acquire Charlotte, North Carolina-based AVINTIV for $2.45 billion cash.[8]

For the September 2016 quarter, the Company had operating income of $151 million compared to $107 million in the same prior year quarter.¬† The 41 percent year-over-year increase was primarily attributed to the acquisition of Avintiv, a $22 million improvement in our product mix and price/cost spread including contributions from sourcing synergies, a $12 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses, and a $9 million reduction in restructuring and business integration expenses.¬† These positive contributions were partially offset by a $16 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and a $6 million negative impact from currency translation.
