He was able to assess the financial and business related issues and conflicts in a very short time period.  He gained the trust of the physicians and staff making a potentially difficult transition occur smoothly with no loss of staff.See moreSee lessIt is a pleasure to write on behalf of Jim Thornton.  I am the Chief of the Medical Staff at John Dempsey Hospital and had the opportunity to work closely with Jim during his tenure as CEO of our hospital. 

Jim had a strong sense of mission- to optimize the value and profitability of our hospital while never once compromising patient care, and never once failing to envision ways to enhance the quality of what we do.  His background in finance, combined with operations at other hospitals, gave him a strong footing on planning and strategy;  he was always concerned with the strategic impact of his decisions.  While one could expect that he was penny-wise, he was never pound-foolish, with a great respect for investment, not only for financial improvement, but for clinical service improvement

He commanded great respect and loyalty from the employees of the hospital, as well as from the physician faculty and the managers.  He was able to identify and nurture strengths among his constituents, was an excellent communicator, and was always even-handed in his interpersonal dealings.

Most important, Jim sought advice when advice was appropriate, and always carefully weighed the advice he received in the context of his mission.

We miss him deeply.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended James H.View James H.’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact James H. directlyView James H.’s Full ProfileNot the James H. you’re looking for?

Thorntons Inc. is a gasoline and convenience store chain with locations in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee.[1] It was founded on November 1, 1971 by James H. Thornton. Thorntons is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky.
Thornton, a 1946 graduate of New Albany High School, first gained entry into the gasoline industry working at a station owned by his stepfather. In 1951, at the age of 24, he became one of the partners of Dixie Dance gas stations. Thornton eventually joined Ashland Inc. in 1955 maintaining a relationship with them until 1970. The first "Thorntons" location opened in 1971 in Clarksville, Indiana. The original site featured a kiosk building and a full-service attendant. In the 1980s Thorntons transitioned from kiosk locations to convenience stores and grew to over 100 locations.
In 2013 Thorntons introduced a larger store with an expanded food program in select Louisville, Kentucky and Southern Indiana stores.[2] In 2016, this platform was expanded in select Chicago metropolitan area stores along with the roll out of Unleaded15TM. Unleaded15 provides an octane rating of 88 and contains approximately 15% ethanol.[3]

                            Firm profile submitted by Thornton Grout Finnigan LLP
Number of partners: 8 
        Number of lawyers: 16 
        Languages: English
Thornton Grout Finnigan LLP (“TGF”) is a Canadian boutique law firm with an office located in the financial district of Toronto, Ontario, practicing exclusively in two areas: (i) insolvency and restructuring, and (ii) litigation. As one of the first Canadian firms to recognise the value provided by a high-end boutique model, TGF was founded in a spirit of innovation with a view to providing a more focused and efficient vehicle for delivering legal services to sophisticated clients. TGF is a mix of senior restructuring and litigation lawyers with a full range of experience gained by years of practice, both inside and outside major full service law firms, combined with talented and energetic younger lawyers who thrive in the entrepreneurial environment of a boutique firm. The firm’s reputation and expertise is reflected in the series of high profile retainers it has enjoyed over the years and its wide range of clients, including financial institutions, regulatory agencies, publicly traded corporations and officers and directors. TGF delivers practical, business-oriented advice in a dynamic and time sensitive environment. Its various mandates reflect TGF’s unique position in the delivery of the highest quality restructuring and litigation services to sophisticated clients in a specialised market. TGF is widely recognised for its leading national and international restructuring practice. The TGF restructuring group applies its deep experience in restructuring to find creative and business-oriented solutions that have led to strong, long-lasting relationships with its clients. TGF lawyers have been involved in almost all major insolvency proceedings within this jurisdiction over the last twenty five years covering virtually every business sector. The TGF litigation group has arrived at the top of the commercial litigation bar by focusing on representing sophisticated parties in complex commercial disputes. TGF’s work begins with developing a clear understanding of the client’s business goals, and then developing a strategy to ensure that those goals are met through an efficient and effective use of the TGF team. TGF has cultivated relationships with tax, corporate, real estate, pension/employment and securities lawyers within Canada and in a number of jurisdictions worldwide who are utilised on a regular and reciprocal basis. The quality of these relationships and the flexibility of a focused boutique allows TGF to retain specialists in other fields who are the most experienced and appropriate to retain as an agent on any aspect of a file, subject always to the client’s prior approval. The recognition of TGF’s skill and experience is reflected in the leading role TGF lawyers have been invited to assume in professional development initiatives. Lawyers at TGF include editors and contributing editors of professional publications and a leading text book used by practitioners, and directors in the profession’s leading organisations as well as instructors in the Faculties of Law at three Ontario law schools.

I started seeing this Dr, at the age of 5 years old. I had severe childhood anxiety, chronic migraines, severe fatigue and random vomiting, constant nausea, balance problems, excessive hight growth, menstural problems, debilitating back pain, delayed response times and other odd symptoms. Over the years I was diagnosed with mono (many times), polycystic ovaries, chronic anxiety, manic depression, bulimia, hypochondria, fibromyalgia among many other diseases. I ended up getting my tonsils out for one reason or another at the age of 17 and had to get a brain scan before this could be done. The MRI was sent to Weingart and the surgeon. There was a golfball sized tumor clearly on the MRI, which was not reported by the radiologist either...it just said to follow up. There was no follow up. At the age of 20 my neurological symptoms and back pain skyrocketed and I began having seizures, I finally ended up getting another scan of my brain that showed a que ball sizwd tumor in my right frontal lobe. I don't blame all of this on Dr. W but he should have done a lot more to assess my symptoms in the first place. I have had 2 open craniotomies now and have a stage 3 oligoastrocytoma (brain cancer). I recently had an MRI of my back that also shows a completely collapsed disc. One of the dr.'s PA's had seen a prior MRI at the age of 20 and told me there was nothing wrong. I will be getting surgery on my back in 1 month and I am only 22 years old.

I've never waited more than 10 minutes to be seen.  Appointments have always been easy to schedule, not requiring several days to be seen by Dr. Weingart.  I have found the staff to be professional, courteous, and attentive.  This family medicine practice sees patients across the spectrum age-wise and the staff knows many by name.  How rare!  I never really had the opportunity to read magazines while waiting because my wait was always very brief.  Dr. Weingart is a caring physician, who makes suggestions regarding steps he thinks his patient should take and is very thorough in his explanation for why he thinks they would be prudent decisions.  I would highly recommend Dr. James Weingart as a primary physician.

                            Do you feel that you could have received better service somewhere else?
                        

                            Probably, I wasn't impressed
                        

                            Does this provider treat every client equally?
                        

                            Definitely, they make everyone feel equally respected and cared for
                        

                            Would you recommend this family doctor to others?
                        

                            I Already Have
                        

                            Did this provider leave you unattended for an extended period of time?
                        

                            I was left alone for a while, but it wasn't too long
                        

                            Does this provider adhere to the customer is always right policy?
                        

                            Yes, they listen to all complaints and make every effort to correct the situation.

                            Was it easy to find parking at this provider's office?
                        

                            Extremely easy, and close to the entrance
