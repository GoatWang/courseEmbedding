BARBERMurphy Group's Properties Go Video



            Video marketing is fast becoming one of the most popular ways for potential buyers
            to get their first impression and insight to listed properties. As they say, a picture
            is worth a thousand words and now a video is worth ten times that. Over one billion
            people view YouTube videos each month, and over six billion hours of video is watched.
            Through a strategic partnership with In-Sight Aerial Productions, the BARBERMurphy
            Group now offers clients the opportunity to have professional, aerial real estate
            video presentations made of their property using commercial drone HD aerial video
            equipment. This cutting edge technology along with professional editing and post
            production services showcase the client’s property from perspectives that were not
            possible before. "The videos are a professionally tailored production that will
            better showcase the details of a property to the market place", said Paul Murphy,
            Principal. After production, the video is then uploaded on BARBERMurphy's own web
            based video channel called VIMEO and embedded on the BARBERMurphy Group's website
            listing at www.barbermurphy.com. The video will also be incorporated into the other
            marketing components used by BARBERMurphy Group.

                “We are growing and have been looking for additional experienced brokers, so this
