                Kenneth Lundeen, CEO of Environmental Reclamation Co., was nominated as a BBJ outstanding director for his work as a board member for Howard Bancorp.

                Harry Bosk            








 



In nine years on the Howard Bancorp Inc. board of directors, Kenneth C. Lundeen has established himself as indispensable.
Mary Ann Scully, CEO of Howard Bank, said Lundeen “is the board member whom every CEO wishes they had access to on their board, as well as the board member whom every regulatory and supervisory body believes should be on each board.”

Harry Bosk










 


High praise, indeed.
In addition to serving an essential role for Howard Bank, Lundeen also has proven to be versatile by holding several leadership roles on the board and chairing multiple task forces.





What do you think makes a good director?
Certainly, one who has a high level of integrity, who approaches their various undertakings with a strong sense of seriousness and responsibility; an individual who has particular skills or experiences that are valued to the organization they would serve as a director of. It’s very important they have the time to effectively serve as a director. Finally, someone who has an interest in the organization — whether that’s an interest in its mission or an interest by reason of personal investment or otherwise. But an interest serves as the foundation for really being engaged as a director.
How have the responsibilities of directors changed since you started?
I do not believe the fundamental responsibilities of directors have changed — certainly not in the nine years that I’ve served on the board of Howard Bank. What has changed in my view is an increasing lack of tolerance for directors who do not fulfill their fundamental responsibilities, and that’s a positive change.
How have you personally changed because of those responsibilities?
I don’t think that I have personally changed. I’ve certainly gained a great deal of experience.
What is the most meaningful thing you get from serving?
Without question, it’s the opportunity to work with, get to know and learn from a very large group of individuals with high intellect and integrity; a wide variety of experience; [and] a commitment to excellence in the pursuit of the development of a bank [that is] successfully serving our community.





 


What would you say is the biggest challenge?
The biggest challenge, to me, is becoming and remaining fully informed about the affairs of the bank and matters effecting the bank both internally and externally.
What was your biggest trepidation about becoming a director?
Whether I would have the ability, the time and the knowledge to effectively serve the board.
What advice would you give to someone who’s interested in becoming a director?
Make sure you allocate a generous amount of time to serve. The time that’s required is far more than attending meetings. I would advise anyone who’s considering serving to make sure that they’re well informed about the organization and its affairs. I would also recommend that they as early as possible get to know and understand the CEO. The CEO is the individual conduit through which much information comes to the board and it’s the individual primarily responsible for effecting the decisions and directions of the board. I would recommend that an individual ask questions. They should be informed questions. That they listen to the responses. Responses are not always answers. They clearly should listen to views and consider views of their fellow directors and others. And, finally, to be engaged.
If you could sum up the role of a director in one word, which word would you choose?
That word would be direction. It’s not coincidental that we’re called directors.
