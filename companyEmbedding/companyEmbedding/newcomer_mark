You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Memories & Condolences






Mark...what would be a accurate way to describe you? Caring,kind,always joking and making everyone laugh. Most of all my man...I am truly convinced you took a bullet for me thus changing my life for the good. Like you took me by the hand to the realm of happiness. Thank You so much Mark, for I will love and be grateful to you forever.Thank You for saving my life,Love,Rdp

Uncle Mark,I am a little late in writing this, just didn't have the courage to say goodbye. I am so proud to call you my Uncle. No matter what happened in my life or the decisions that I made, you were the only person that never judged, or said a word, for that I am so grateful. I will always remember the conversation that we just had on the telephone just 3 weeks ago. You told me how I did such a great job raising my son, and that he is such a good kid, and you were so excited that he went fishing, and caught some fish just for you and brought them to you, and you told me how you were going to put them on the grill. I am so sorry that I couldn't be there to say goodbye to you, but when I come to N.Y. to visit, I will visit you, along with Grandma, and Grandpa. We will have your memories forever. My favorite ones are the fun times on Christmas Eve. You always put on the best firework show. You are now with Grandma and Grandpa, and will watch over us all. I will always love you! Love Tracie

My condolences to your family for their loss. Even though it's been a number of years, Mark was at the core a great friend, trusted, generous, adventurous, high spirited, fun-loving and  multi-talented. I'll always remember you driving up to Moose River Plains with Johnny M's King Klipsh speakers in the back of your truck, and then connecting to my awesome car stereo. The Adirondacks were and always will be rocking in your memory!  Rest in peace my friend!Paul CAPDMF White

It's been many years since I've seen you, Mark, but the memories of all the pranks and fun times with you during the Our Lady of Pompei years still make me laugh after all this time. Who of us would ever think as kids that the days of losing our childhood friends would ever come? May Eternal Light shine upon you, my friend. You will be missed....

My Dearest Mark,I can try to tell you how I love you but words can never express my true love and appreciation for who and what you have been to me in the past 10 yrs. I relied on your help totally and you've touched my life in a way no one has! My ego wasn't ready for you to leave us and now I wander around in disbelief and grief. I never told you just quite how much I appreciated what you've done for me. You were a blessing I probably didn't deserve.thank you for all the wonderful help, laughs and fireworks. Even if some people didn't appreciate them there were more that did!my life is richer because of you!all my LOVEGuy

I love you little brother always have always will. If I could give you back your life in place of mine I whole heartdly would  I will love and miss you emcilly  Barb

I will never forget the night of Xmas eve at my house with my whole yard full of huge holes with atomic firecrackers that lit up the whole sky and the neighborhood . You blew up my ceramic pigs, we all run inside the next thing that happens here comes 4 cop cars knocking on my door on Xmas Eve, we just  kept singing 5 Golden Rings! This is one of the so many crazy things we did as we grew up together Mark, I am going to miss you MU OR MA, we had some fun , laughter, many sad times, many family great times, alot of great Christmas and holiday fun times! You watched all my children grow up and grandchildren, you watched my son become a Marine, I don't know what else to say I thought you would still be here to talk to me for a while as my baby brother why aren't you I don't understand why did this happen so soon I didnt get a chance to say goodbye its not fair , Ron made strawberry jam for you , and you didn't even try it yet, this is not fair. We love you Mark, Ron and I will miss you terribly but we know you will be with Dad & Mom and baby sister Donna, and please send us butterfly kisses I need alot lately!!!

I feel very blessed to have known you, sir. You are a fun, giving man who always made me feel welcome and loved regardless and I will forever be grateful for your simple, open and loving heart.

Uncle Mark, you are going to be missed by so many, you were a great uncle and always spunky! You taught Theo a lot about woodworking which will always be remembered. You were always there for anyone any time of day and never expected anything in return, as I sit here under a tree on my lunch with tears just rolling down my cheeks I knowyou & grandma are taking well care of each other and are probably looking down on me. You have gained your angel wings and are flying high, you were my moms little brother and we are all still in disbelief that you are gone. Please continue to watch over our family as we all grieve through this difficult time. I love you Uncle Mark give Grandma and Grandpa a kissfor me & tell them how much they are greatly missed! RIP LOVE YOU!

Memories & Condolences






Walden Family, I am the chaplain that stayed with you at the BJC hospital during Mark's visit. I wanted to again extend my deepest condolences. I also wanted to let you know that your entire family has been in my prayers. Jesus told us, "Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted." I pray that you continue to find support in each other and know that you are never alone. Mark will always be with each of you. God Bless. Clara UshmanChaplainBJC St Peter's, Progress West





                            ~ Clara Ushman  - May 8, 2017
                        








My deepest sympathies and warmest hugs goes out to all those who loss Mark.  May you gather together to provide support, comfort, and talk about the hilarious memories of Mark that will bring joy to your heart on your difficult days.  Please know that the Holy scriptures tells us at Psalms 34:18 that God is "near to those that are broken at heart, and those who are crushed in spirit he saves."  May you call out to the Almighty and receive this wonderful attention.





                            ~ Marsha         - May 8, 2017
                        








Dear Jeannie:Don't know where to begin or what to say.  Believe the last time I saw Mark was at his dad's funeral.  Through my girls Suzanne and Stacey, Michael and Lisa kept me  informed of Mark and his son.  Also that Mark became a grandpa with a new grandson. Congratulations great grandma.  I'm a great grandma too by my granddaughter Courtney (Suzanne's daughter) who has a 5 year old boy.I'm 77 now and remarried to Ernie Alexander (76)  after Rich passed away in 2001.  Ernie and I were high school sweethearts and he looked me up after Rich's passing.  To make a long story short we have been married for approx. 12 years and live in Rockport, TX. I was totally shocked by the news of Mark's passing and can only tell you it just shouldn't be at such a young age.  If you get this note, please feel free to contact me at shirleyalexander28@sbcglobal.net or Ph. No. 361-463-9822. Stay strong girl, life is a bitch and then you die, right.





                            ~ Shirley Alexander (Walden)  - May 6, 2017

Memories & Condolences






Love you dad.





                            ~ Marcy Benjamin  - February 14, 2017
                        








Marcia - I went to school with Mark and were in many classes together starting in the 7th grade.  My memories of those early years - he was one of the coolest guys in class.  As we got older, 'cooler' evolved to being a genuinely sincere, nice, engaging individual.  It wasn't surprising to read of his love of animals given how big hearted he was with his classmates.  My sympathies to you and your daughters.  Ed Elze





                            ~ Ed Elze  - February 10, 2017
                        








Marcia,marcy, mickayla Im sorry to hear about Mark/Dad passing. my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.





                            ~ Barbara Palleschi  - February 7, 2017
                        








Marcia,  So sorry to hear about Mark's passing.  My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.





                            ~ Debbie Vennett  - February 7, 2017
                        








I am so sorry to read of Mark's passing. I lived near him when we were children and I attended school with him. I will forever remember his smile, his laugh, his passion and energy in life. My condolences to the family, you are in my thoughts.





                            ~ Mary Fox  - February 7, 2017
