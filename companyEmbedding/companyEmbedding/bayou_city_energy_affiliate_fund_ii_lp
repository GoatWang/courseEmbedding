							Bayou City Raises Approximately $1.0 Billion in Two Years for E&P Investments; Closes Second Fund at $310 Million Hard Cap					


Houston, TX – April 3, 2017 – Bayou City Energy (“Bayou City”, “BCE”, or the “Firm”) has now raised $946 million since its 2015 inception to be invested in the North American E&P sector. Most recently, the Firm reached its $310 million hard cap and held the final closing of Bayou City Energy II, L.P. (“Fund II”) on March 31, 2017. 
William McMullen, BCE Founder and Managing Partner, said: “The appetite for oil and gas investments is spectacular. Investors are looking for attractive entry points and differentiated ways to create value in the E&P space. We are fortunate to have such sophisticated partners that possess a clear understanding of the upstream oil and gas landscape. With the closing of our second fund, we have more dry powder to find and cultivate deals that meet our exhaustive criteria.” 
Bayou City makes privately negotiated, control equity investments in the upstream space in the general range of $5 million to $50 million per platform company. The Firm also seeks to make dedicated drilling capital commitments (“Drilling Partnerships”) to leading operators in order to accelerate the development of de-risked locations. 
McMullen added: “We want to thank our current and newest investors for their trust and support. We already closed one transaction in Fund II, the purchase of preferred stock in High Mesa, Inc., and look forward to adding additional platform companies and drilling partnerships soon.” 
Mark Stoner, BCE Partner, concluded: “We are pleased to have raised our second fund within such a short time period. The capital needs of E&P operators remain heightened in this lower for longer price environment, and BCE is committed to partnering with experienced management teams capable of efficiently deploying capital in both our core strategies, platform companies and drilling partnerships.” 
Latham & Watkins LLP served as fund formation counsel. Bayou City did not engage a placement agent in connection with the formation of the fund.
About Bayou City Energy
Bayou City is a private equity firm focused on making investments in the North American upstream oil and gas sector. Bayou City targets privately negotiated investments through two complementary strategies: providing buyout and growth equity capital for operators with current production and identified upside, and partnering with leading operators to provide dedicated drilling capital in off-balance sheet structures. The BCE team, combined with the Firm’s Advisory Board and strategic relationship with Argus Energy Managers, provide operators access to expertise, capital, and trusted partnership.

Bayou City Energy Raises $310M For Second E&P Fund
Apr 3 2017  |  5:46pm ET

Private equity investor Bayou City Energy has raised $310 million in capital commitments for its second energy-focused buyout fund.
The new fund, named Bayou City Energy II, L.P., was oversubscribed and closed at its hard cap, the company said in a statement. The final closing was held on March 31.
As with its previous investment pools, the company will make privately negotiated, control equity investments in the North American E&P sector, with investments running between $5 million and $50 million per platform company. The company also enters into dedicated drilling partnerships to leading operators in order to accelerate the development of de-risked locations. One transaction has been made from Fund II, the company added. 
“The appetite for oil and gas investments is spectacular,” said William McMullen, founder and managing partner of Bayou City, in the statement. “Investors are looking for attractive entry points and differentiated ways to create value in the E&P space. We are fortunate to have such sophisticated partners that possess a clear understanding of the upstream oil and gas landscape.” 
Latham & Watkins LLP served as fund formation counsel. No placement agent was used.
Headquartered in Houston, Bayou City targets privately negotiated investments through two complementary strategies: providing buyout and growth equity capital to operators, and providing dedicated drilling capital in off-balance sheet structures. With the closing of Fund II, the company has now raised a total of $941 million for investments in the upstream oil and gas sectors in North America.

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.

The Firm pursues privately negotiated investments through two complementary strategies: Providing buyout and growth equity capital for small operators with current production, and partnering with leading operators to provide dedicated drilling capital in off-balance sheet structures. BCE Management Bayou City is led by Founding Partner William McMullen, formerly of White Deer Energy and Denham Capital, and Partner Mark Stoner, previously Vice President of Finance at Alta Mesa Holdings, L.P. The Partners are supported by Chief Financial Officer Kristin Eby MacKelvey and Senior Associate Andrew Koehler. Commenting on the launch, Mr. McMullen said: "Our team has quickly worked to high-grade our proprietary pipeline of opportunities, and is very much in execution mode. The results of these efforts are borne out in Bayou City's first acquisition which closed on June 15, 2015. This initial investment is emblematic of the Bayou City approach to value creation. We have partnered with a seasoned and highly qualified management team in a producing asset that generates meaningful production and cash flow despite prior under-exploitation. We plan to make targeted investments in the field to improve operational efficiencies, replace obsolete equipment with modern oilfield technology, recomplete existing wells into new productive zones and drill relatively low-risk infill development wells." Mr. Stoner added: "Small operators have historically been underserved by the institutional capital market. Oilfield operators work hard to boot-strap a concept into production and reserves but are often disproportionately vulnerable to cash flow disruptions during volatile market cycles like the one we are currently experiencing. Bayou City's strategy is to help small E&P companies fill the funding vacuum and provide the capital and expertise needed to unlock significant value for all stakeholders." BCE Advisory Board In addition to its investment professional staff, the Firm's strategic efforts are supplemented by an Advisory Board composed of industry leaders. Members of the Advisory Board include Charles Cherington (Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Intervale Capital), Gregory Beard (Head of Natural Resources and Senior Partner at Apollo Global Management), Alan Clemens (Technical Advisor to Quantum Energy Partners and Chairman of Rio Oil & Gas II, LLC), and Thomas Perich (Chairman of Andrews Kurth LLP). BCE expects to add additional members to its Advisory Board in the coming months.BCE Partners Bayou City was formed with an arm's length arrangement with Intervale Capital, LLC ("Intervale"), a private equity firm focused exclusively on oilfield services with offices in Houston and Boston. The relationship affords Bayou City access to Intervale's deep network of industry relationships and portfolio of leading oilfield service companies. Mr. Cherington said: "We could not be more delighted to collaborate with the Bayou City team. Intervale's portfolio companies include a broad range of service providers and industry participants who can work alongside Bayou City's small operators to identify best-in-class environmental, safety and operational practices. Effectively, the arrangement brings 'in-house' a comprehensive suite of operational expertise previously inaccessible or financially impractical -- a partnership that, in my view, is groundbreaking in the smaller-end of the energy private equity landscape."About BCE Bayou City Energy is a private equity firm focused on making investments in the North American upstream oil & gas sector, targeting deal sizes of $5 to $50 million. Bayou City targets privately negotiated investments through two complementary strategies: Providing buyout and growth equity capital for small operators with current production, and partnering with leading operators to provide dedicated drilling capital in off-balance sheet structures. The BCE team, combined with the Firm's highly qualified Advisory Board and strategic relationship with Intervale Capital, provide small to mid-sized operators access to expertise, capital and quality services typically available only to much larger enterprises.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextKristin Beck, transgender Navy SEAL hero: 'Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy'Business InsiderEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredHighest ranking retired transgender officer slams new plan: I think Trump is ‘being influenced by Pence’Business InsiderFacebook results beat estimates as mobile ad sales soar, stock at record highReutersAmazon’s Echo rivaled by Xiaomi and Facebook: rptYahoo Finance VideoWomen Everywhere Should Carry This Tiny DeviceSiren SongSponsoredMoney Basics: What is a hedge fund?Yahoo FinanceWhite House press secretary threatens to end briefing amid grilling over Trump's transgender banBusiness InsiderPhil Mickelson trash-talked Jordan Spieth at the Open Championship — and Phil is going to have to eat his wordsBusiness InsiderDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredMcCain slams Trump's transgender military ban, says it's why 'major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter'Business InsiderTrump forges ahead to tax reformYahoo Finance VideoMajor indices hit new closing highs; Facebook earnings on tapYahoo FinanceStart Earning Miles With The Best Travel CardWise BreadSponsoredTrump announces that Apple's top supplier, Foxconn, is building a $10 billion TV factory in WisconsinBusiness InsiderAmazon earnings — What you need to know in markets on ThursdayYahoo FinanceSens.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate.

Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Overview
The Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. Bull and Bear 3X Shares seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index. There is no guarantee the funds will meet their stated investment objectives.
These leveraged ETFs seek a return that is 300% or -300% of the return of their benchmark index for a single day. The funds should not be expected to provide three times or negative three times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
