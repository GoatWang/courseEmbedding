Salesforce is an easy-to-use, cloud-based CRM (customer relationship management) solution used by businesses in every industry to increase sales, generate more leads, improve customer service, and ultimately grow. With no hardware or software to maintain, Salesforce scales to your business needs and helps you keep costs down and do more with small teams.
It’s the business management solution for those who don’t want the hassles of business software — and there’s nothing to install. You simply log in through a Web browser and everything you need to succeed with your sales process, lead generation, and account management is at your fingertips.
In fact, Salesforce CRM solutions save your company time and money by automating tasks that can keep your people from focusing on customers and big picture initiatives. And because our products work 100% in the cloud, they eliminate the need for costly on-premises IT staff, costly repairs, downtime, and software upgrades.

Low setup costs. No hardware, no software, no hassle.
Automatic upgrades: 3 times a year.
Out-of-the-box and customizable CRM to run your business in one place.

Improve productivity for you and your team with integrated email, easy collaboration, streamlined processes, and mobile CRM.

Need to ensure your salespeople have access to the information they need when out at customer meetings? No problem. Our CRM system is fully mobile, so your data is available on any connected device, at any time.
On average, Salesforce helps our customers boost their sales by 37%. But the benefits of Salesforce CRM for small business don’t end when you make a sale. Customer service benefits, too. Our solutions help to build stronger relationships with your current customers, win new ones, and accelerate business growth. And intelligent marketing automation helps you focus resources on the tasks that really add value, while a common platform for all your data helps to build strong relationships across all your channels, including social, Web, email, and customer call centers.

Manage sales - Salesforce.com




















Run and grow your
business with the world's
#1 CRM solution.






What is CRM?
The definition of CRM is customer relationship management. In a nutshell, CRM lets you store and manage prospect and customer information, like contact info, accounts, leads, and sales opportunities, in one central location. You’ll discover that it’s not just a fancy contact list. Ultimately, a CRM solution is a game-changing piece of technology for every industry under the sun — from retail and manufacturing, to real estate, construction, and many more.
As a result, CRM can help you:

Increase leads
Close more deals, faster
Drive customer loyalty and satisfaction

Salesforce gives you all you need to work smarter and faster, and help you keep your customers happy.

Small business CRM from Salesforce
Even if your customer base is small, no one can keep every interaction — ones that have happened, or need to happen — memorized and organized.
At Salesforce, we believe small businesses can use technology as a force multiplier to punch way above their weight. Our cloud-based CRM solution levels the playing field for your small business.
Because Salesforce is in the cloud, it can grow and scale with your business. You can easily add features from tons of apps in our marketplaces without adding costly infrastructure, and Salesforce upgrades are instantly implemented as soon as they’re available without disruption. With all your information on customers, prospects, and leads stored on a single online platform, everyone in your business has access to the latest information — no more version control headaches or out-of-date spreadsheets. Need to ensure your salespeople have access to the information they need when out at customer meetings? No problem. Our CRM system is fully mobile, so your data is available on any connected device, at any time.
On average, Salesforce helps our customers boost their sales by 37%. But the benefits of Salesforce CRM for small business don’t end when you make a sale. Customer service benefits, too. Our solutions help to build stronger relationships with your current customers, win new ones, and accelerate business growth. And intelligent marketing automation helps you focus resources on the tasks that really add value, while a common platform for all your data helps to build strong relationships across all your channels, including social, Web, email, and customer call centers.

Grow faster with the
world's #1 CRM solution,
Salesforce.






Sell, service, market, and connect to grow your business every day.

Salesforce is an easy-to-use, cloud-based CRM (customer relationship management) solution used by businesses in every industry to increase sales, generate more leads, improve customer service, and ultimately grow. With no hardware or software to maintain, Salesforce scales to your business needs and helps you keep costs down and do more with small teams.
It’s the business management solution for those who don’t want the hassles of business software — and there’s nothing to install. You simply log in through a Web browser and everything you need to succeed with your sales process, lead generation, and account management is at your fingertips.
In fact, Salesforce CRM solutions save your company time and money by automating tasks that can keep your people from focusing on customers and big picture initiatives. And because our products work 100% in the cloud, they eliminate the need for costly on-premises IT staff, costly repairs, downtime, and software upgrades.
What makes Salesforce ideal for you?

It’s a cloud-based CRM solution.
Low setup costs. No hardware, no software, no hassle.
Automatic upgrades: 3 times a year.
Out-of-the-box and customizable CRM to run your business in one place.
Scales with your business. Add users when you need to.
Integrate with best-in-class apps.
Enterprise-level cloud security for businesses of any size.
It helps increase sales.






Track and manage contacts from lead to customer. Give sales the info they need for a precise follow-up.




Personalize pitches and win more deals with a complete view of the customer — their account, activity history, and connections.




Improve productivity for you and your team with integrated email, easy collaboration, streamlined processes, and mobile CRM.




Automate repetitive tasks, and focus on following up, building relationships, and closing deals, not administrative duties.





On average, Salesforce customers see a 37% jump in sales revenue.

Small business CRM from Salesforce
At Salesforce, we believe small businesses can use technology as a force multiplier to punch way above their weight. Our cloud-based CRM solution levels the playing field for your small business.
Because Salesforce is in the cloud, it can grow and scale with your business. You can easily add features from tons of apps in our marketplaces without adding costly infrastructure, and Salesforce upgrades are instantly implemented as soon as they’re available. With all your information on customers, prospects, and leads stored on a single online platform, everyone in your business has access to the latest information — no more version control headaches or out-of-date spreadsheets. Need to ensure your salespeople have access to the information they need when out at customer meetings? No problem. Our CRM system is fully mobile, so your data is available on any connected device, at any time.
On average, Salesforce helps our customers boost their sales by 37%. But the benefits of Salesforce CRM for small business don’t end when you make a sale. Customer service benefits, too. Our solutions help to build stronger relationships with your current customers, win new ones, and accelerate business growth. And intelligent marketing automation helps you focus resources on the tasks that really add value, while a common platform for all your data helps to build strong relationships across all your channels, including social, Web, email, and customer call centers.

Manage sales - Salesforce.com




















Run and grow your
business with the world's
#1 CRM solution.






What is CRM?
The definition of CRM is customer relationship management. In a nutshell, CRM lets you store and manage prospect and customer information, like contact info, accounts, leads, and sales opportunities, in one central location. You’ll discover that it’s not just a fancy contact list. Ultimately, a CRM solution is a game-changing piece of technology for every industry under the sun — from retail and manufacturing, to real estate, construction, and many more.
As a result, CRM can help you:

Increase leads
Close more deals, faster
Drive customer loyalty and satisfaction

Salesforce gives you all you need to work smarter and faster, and help you keep your customers happy.

Small business CRM from Salesforce
Even if your customer base is small, no one can keep every interaction — ones that have happened, or need to happen — memorized and organized.
At Salesforce, we believe small businesses can use technology as a force multiplier to punch way above their weight. Our cloud-based CRM solution levels the playing field for your small business.
Because Salesforce is in the cloud, it can grow and scale with your business. You can easily add features from tons of apps in our marketplaces without adding costly infrastructure, and Salesforce upgrades are instantly implemented as soon as they’re available without disruption. With all your information on customers, prospects, and leads stored on a single online platform, everyone in your business has access to the latest information — no more version control headaches or out-of-date spreadsheets. Need to ensure your salespeople have access to the information they need when out at customer meetings? No problem. Our CRM system is fully mobile, so your data is available on any connected device, at any time.
On average, Salesforce helps our customers boost their sales by 37%. But the benefits of Salesforce CRM for small business don’t end when you make a sale. Customer service benefits, too. Our solutions help to build stronger relationships with your current customers, win new ones, and accelerate business growth. And intelligent marketing automation helps you focus resources on the tasks that really add value, while a common platform for all your data helps to build strong relationships across all your channels, including social, Web, email, and customer call centers.
