                Carey CreditIncome Fund
            
Carey Credit Income Fund (CCIF) is a non-traded business development company (BDC)

capital appreciation.

                What Is Carey Credit Income Fund?
            
CCIF's current offering, Carey Credit Income Fund – I (CCIF – I), is a feeder fund in a master/feeder structure that is designed to provide its investors with: 


Current Income
Capital Preservation
Capital Appreciation, to a lesser extent



                        There is no guarantee these objectives and goals will be achieved.
                    









                HOW DOES CCIF CREATE VALUE FOR ITS INVESTORS?
            
CCIF intends to invest primarily in large, privately-negotiated loans to private middle market U.S. companies, focusing on senior secured debt investments.
CCIF seeks to provide value for the investors of its feeder funds through its experienced management team and disciplined investment strategy that seeks to capitalize on the supply/demand imbalances in the market.






Management
W. P. Carey Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, LLC, parent companies of the Advisors to CCIF, have a 50+ year aggregate track record, and both play an active role in sourcing, evaluating and monitoring portfolio investments.






Alignment
W. P. Carey Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, LLC have made an initial commitment of $50 million in CCIF, effectively aligning their interests with those of the feeder fund shareholders.1






Opportunity
U.S. middle market companies are continuously looking for capital to invest into their businesses. CCIF seeks to capitalize on the shortage in supply of financing from traditional lenders by providing loans to these companies.2




1The Sub-Advisor’s alignment of interest today is maintained by Guggenheim Partners, LLC, the parent company of Guggenheim Partners Investment Management LLC, the Sub-Advisor.
2CCIF seeks to primarily invest in the senior secured debt of private middle market American companies.

Investing in privately held middle market companies involves a number of risks including reduced access to capital, diminished ability to
withstand financial distress and limited liquidity.







 HOW WILL CCIF GUIDE INVESTORS IN THEIR SEARCH FOR INCOME?
CCIF is the master fund, which pools investor capital raised through its feeder funds—such as the current fund offering, CCIF – I. Both master and feeder share the same investment objectives and strategies. All portfolio investments are made by Carey Credit Income Fund, the master fund.


 

 Investors can only acquire shares in a feeder fund, which invests substantially all of its assets in the common shares of CCIF at net asset value, which will vary over time. CCIF, the master fund, and the feeder funds share the same investment objectives and strategies. The imposition of fees and expenses may affect a non-traded BDC’s ability to generate income.







                ExperiencedManagement Team
            
W. P. Carey Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, LLC have a 50+ year aggregate investment track record. Both firms have a shared commitment to protecting shareholders’ wealth.



 


 W. P. Carey Inc. is a publicly traded REIT that provides long-term sale-leaseback and build-to-suit financing for companies worldwide.  Its portfolio of global real estate has an enterprise value of $10.7 billion. In addition, W. P. Carey manages a series of investment programs with approximately $13.0 billion in AUM.1






 


Guggenheim Partners, LLC is a global investment and advisory firm with more than $260 billion in AUM.2 Its Corporate Credit team’s long-term investment focus combined with its emphasis on downside protection has made it the investment manager of choice for many insurance companies, public pensions, foundations, and high-net-worth investors.






1As of March 31, 2017.
2 Assets under management are as of March 31, 2017. Guggenheim Partners, LLC assets include consulting services for clients whose assets are valued at approximately $59 billion.

Investors in a feeder fund will not be acquiring an interest in W. P. Carey Inc. or Guggenheim Partners, LLC, parent companies of the Advisors to CCIF.

Nuveen Covered Call Closed-End Funds 
For income-oriented investors who are seeking the growth and diversification potential of equities, but who desire higher income and reduced volatility, covered call closed-end funds (also known as equity option closed-end funds) can be an attractive diversifying portfolio opportunity.



Covered Call Strategies for Today's Income Investors 
Nuveen's covered call closed-end funds have been designed to meet the income, risk, and diversification needs of income-oriented investors. Combining a traditional equity portfolio strategy of persistently selling covered calls, then monetizing the long-term expected total returns into quarterly cash distributions, results in the strong potential for a diversifying, higher-yielding and more stable investment.

Nuveen S&P 500 DynamicOverwrite Fund (SPXX)


Nasdaq

Nuveen Nasdaq 100 DynamicOverwrite Fund (QQQX)


DJIA

Nuveen Dow 30SM DynamicOverwrite Fund (DIAX)



What are covered call strategies?
							Covered call strategy funds invest in a portfolio of stocks, and sell call options on either individual stocks or stock indices, for the purpose of enhancing total return, reducing volatility, and providing a measure of downside protection over time.  The fund receives a premium from the buyer of the call option, and must sell or deliver the underlying stock (or cash, in the case of a stock index call option) if the call option is exercised by the buyer.  The value of the stocks that are linked to call options sold, relative to the value of full stock portfolio, is termed the Option Overwrite percentage.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.
