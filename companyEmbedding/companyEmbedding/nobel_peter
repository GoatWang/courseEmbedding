Peter Nobel (/noʊˈbɛl/; Swedish: [nʊˈbɛl]; born 1931) is a Swedish human rights lawyer and a member of the Nobel family, who served as Sweden's first Ombudsman for discrimination (1986–1991), Secretary General of the Swedish Red Cross (1991–94), and an expert for the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (1998–2001).
Peter Nobel is a descendant of the industrialist and humanitarian Ludvig Nobel, the founder of Branobel.
Like several other members of his family, among them Marta Helena Nobel-Oleinikoff, he is a fierce critic of the Bank of Sweden's prize in Economics, and what he and his family sees as misuse of their family name by the awarding institution. He argues that no member of the Nobel family has ever had the intention of creating a prize in economics.[1]
