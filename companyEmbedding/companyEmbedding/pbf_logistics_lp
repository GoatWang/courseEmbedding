PARSIPPANY, N.J., Feb. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- PBF Logistics LP (NYSE:   PBFX, the "Partnership") announced today that a wholly-owned subsidiary has entered into an agreement to acquire four refined product terminals located in the greater Philadelphia region (the "East Coast Terminals") from an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. for a total consideration of $100.0 million. This acquisition expands the Partnership's storage and terminalling footprint and introduces third-party customers to the Partnership's revenue base. The acquisition is expected to be financed through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings from the Partnership's senior secured revolving credit facility and equity, which may include common units sold to our sponsor, PBF Energy. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.
PBFX Chief Executive Officer Thomas Nimbley said, "The acquisition of the East Coast Terminals is PBFX's first third-party acquisition, adds meaningful third-party, fee-based revenue and represents an attractive acquisition multiple. The addition of the East Coast Terminals increases the Partnership's total capacity by over 100% to approximately 8.1 million shell barrels and diversifies its customer and asset base. We expect the acquisition to be accretive to distributable cash flow upon closing." Mr. Nimbley continued, "PBF Logistics has been able to execute its strategy and deliver growth to our unitholders. PBF Energy, as a sponsor, is committed to the continued growth and strategic development of PBF Logistics. We are excited about the transaction and look forward to welcoming the East Coast Terminals employees and customers to the PBF Logistics family. 
Located in the Philadelphia market, the East Coast Terminals are ideally situated in the sixth largest metropolitan area in the United States with significant local demand for refined products.  The terminals provide a critical link for the approximately 1.3 million barrels per day of refining capacity located within 100 miles of the terminals and associated downstream demand.  With extensive pipeline, truck and deep-water marine connectivity, the East Coast terminals have the flexibility to accommodate a wide variety of potential customer requirements.   
The East Coast Terminals are expected to allow PBF Logistics to leverage its expanded footprint and capitalize on commercial opportunities with new customers and leverage opportunities with PBF Energy due to the close proximity of PBF Energy's East Coast refining system. In conjunction with the transaction, the Partnership expects to invest approximately $5 million, from cash on hand, to improve infrastructure in order to increase throughput capability at the East Coast Terminals. Based on a total transaction cost of $105 million, including the $5 million investment and synergy opportunities, the Partnership expects the East Coast Terminals to generate approximately $15 million of pro forma EBITDA, of which approximately two-thirds is expected to be from third-party customers. 
The assets to be acquired include a total of 57 product tanks with a total shell capacity of approximately 4.2 million shell barrels, pipeline connections to the Colonial, Buckeye, Sunoco Logistics and other proprietary pipeline systems, 26 truck loading lanes and marine facilities capable of handling barges and ships.  
Non-GAAP Measures  
PBF Logistics LP Reconciliation of Amounts under US GAAP to Forecasted EBITDA (unaudited, in millions)



Reconciliation of East Coast Terminals Forecasted  





Net Income to pro forma EBITDA: 










Forecasted net income                                                                   


$8.7



Add: Depreciation and amortization expense                       


5.3



Add: Interest expense, net and other financing costs        


1.0



Pro forma EBITDA                                                                            


$15.0

 
The Partnership defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:

our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods; 
the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unit holders; 
our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and 
the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.
The Partnership's management believes that the presentation of EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash from operations or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some but not all items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. Due to the forward-looking nature of forecasted EBITDA, information to reconcile forecasted EBITDA to forecasted cash flow from operating activities is not available as management is unable to project working capital changes for future periods at this time.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
