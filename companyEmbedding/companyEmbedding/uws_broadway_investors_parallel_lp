Fort Washington Raises $450 Million in Private Equity Funds
Capital raised exceeds target 
CINCINNATI – January 20, 2015   Fort Washington Capital Partners Group ("FW Capital"), the institutional private equity division of Fort Washington Investment Advisors, Inc., is pleased to announce the final closing of private equity funds in two investment strategies:  Fort Washington Private Equity Investors VIII, LP and its parallel vehicle (together, "Fund VIII") and Fort Washington Private Equity Opportunities Fund III, LP and its parallel vehicle (together, "Opportunities III").
Fund VIII, a private equity fund-of-funds, closed with $300 million of capital commitments in December 2014, significantly above the fund’s original target of $200 million. Opportunities III, a special situations private equity fund, closed at its target fund size and hard-cap of $150 million in capital commitments in May 2014. The $450 million in aggregate capital raised from investors is the largest ever for these FW Capital strategies.
"We are very pleased with the support from our existing investors, new investors, and their consultants," said Steve Baker, managing director and deputy head of private equity. "Raising capital in two strategies in just under 17 months is a testament to our team’s track record, capabilities, and relationships with our investment partners. This is really an exceptional step for our private equity business. We set out to raise $350 million and were oversubscribed due to significant investor interest in our two strategies."
Fund VIII launched with a target of $200 million in capital commitments. However, because of outstanding support from institutional investors and consultants, FW Capital increased its target to $300 million.  Fund VIII was formed to make primary investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds that FW Capital believes exhibit an attractive investment strategy.  Fund VIII represents a continuation of FW Capital’s primary investment strategy of targeting smaller, leading fund managers.
Opportunities III launched with a target fund size and hard-cap of $150 million in capital commitments, which was achieved when it held a final closing in May 2014. FW Capital formed Opportunities III to continue its demonstrated strategy of investing in special situations with unique and/or complicated structuring requirements, and acquiring limited partnership interests in private equity funds on the secondary market.

About Western & Southern Financial Group, Inc.

   While its heritage may be Western and Southern, Western & Southern Financial Group covers the Northern and Eastern US as well. The company offers a variety of life insurance products and annuities, accident and supplemental health coverage, mutual funds, and other investment management products and services. Western & Southern's financial services include mutual fund administration, trust services, financial advisory, and real estate development; it owns or manages some $69 billion in assets. The company is licensed in most states and in Washington, DC.
  
Operations

   Western & Southern Financial Group operates more than a dozen subsidiaries that offer everything from critical illness insurance to funds and annuities. Some of the company's subsidiaries include Western & Southern Life Insurance, (life and health insurance products, fixed annuities), and Western-Southern Life Assurance subsidiary (universal life, term life, and annuities). Other insurance divisions include Columbus Life Insurance, Integrity Life Insurance, Lafayette Life Insurance, and National Integrity Life Insurance Company.
  

   For affluent clients seeking investment advice, Western & Southern operates Fort Washington Investment Advisors to manage private equity assets for corporate and government institutions and wealthy individuals; it has more than $39 billion under management. Other financial services include mutual fund management through Touchstone Investments.
  

   The company's Eagle Realty Group participates in commercial real estate investment. Eagle Realty Group was the development manager for the recently built Great American Tower in Cincinnati. The skyscraper is the city's tallest building and opened up to occupants in 2011, with its primary tenant being hometown insurance rival American Financial Group.
  

   Other member companies include IFS Financial Services, Peppertree Partners, Touchstone Advisors, Touchstone Securities, W&S Financial Group Distributors, and W&S Brokerage Services.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The company markets its products and services through a sales force of direct representatives; it also sells through a network of independent agents and financial planners. It also conducts advertising activities through television commercials. Western & Southern's customer base is wide and varied, consisting of individuals and families of all income levels, large corporations, small to midsized businesses, financial institutions, real estate investors, and not-for-profit entities.
  
Financial Performance

   Like many conservative mutual insurers, Western & Southern holds a long-term investment strategy that has served it well financially. In 2015, it posted net revenue of $3.3 billion, an increase of 7% compared to 2014.  This was fueled by a spike in revenue from insurance premiums and product charges driven by a rise in life and health premiums and annuity sales. After declining in 2014, profits jumped 1% in 2015 due to a decrease in other operating expenses and income tax expenses.
  
Strategy

   Western & Southern tends to grow its business and customer base by launching new products aimed at filling gaps in its existing areas of operation. It is looking to reach otherwise underserved middle-market customers by extending weekend and evening sales, expanding its online sales presence, and providing more bilingual sales information online.
  

   In 2015 W&S Financial Group Distributors launched of a new variable annuity living benefit rider, Guaranteed Lifetime Income Advantage Plus.
  

   That year Washington Capital Partners Group (the institutional private equity division of Fort Washington Investment Advisors) closed private equity funds in two investment strategies: Fort Washington Private Equity Investors VIII, LP and its parallel vehicle (together, Fund VIII) for $300 million; and Fort Washington Private Equity Opportunities Fund III, LP and its parallel vehicle (together, Opportunities III) for $150 million.
  

   In 2015, W&S Financial Group Distributors introduced Indextra, a single premium deferred fixed indexed annuity issued by Integrity Life Insurance.
  
Company Background

   Western & Southern was founded in 1888.
