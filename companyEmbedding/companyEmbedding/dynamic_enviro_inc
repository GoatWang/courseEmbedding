When asked what he liked about Spilltration products, Brant said:
“Spilltration products are compact and take up 400% less space than traditional spill control materials.  This allows us to bring more firepower to bear at the scene of the spill.”
“The SpillBoa sorbent barrier is amazing.  It deploys 40X faster than traditional sorbent boom.  So, we can contain spills more quickly and save money for our customers.”
“And, Spilltration materials allow us to cleanup hydrocarbons in wet weather, where traditional spill materials are ineffective.”
“On top of all that, you can squeeze and reuse Spilltration products, reducing our waste substantially.”
“We plan to continue to expand DEI services and look forward to using Spilltration products to help us be more competitive and serve or clients better.”
