History[edit]
The company's roots in the Madison area date back more than 150 years to its predecessor company, the Madison Gas Light and Coke Co., which was founded in 1855. The Madison Electric Light and Power Co. began delivering electric service in 1888. At the time, Madison had a population of 13,000.

In 1896, the Four Lakes Light and Power Company and the Madison City Gas Light and Coke Co. combined and incorporated to become Madison Gas and Electric Co.
The Madison Gas and Electric Company Powerhouse was built in 1902. In 1915, it was remodeled at a cost of $150,000. The building was designated a landmark by the Madison Landmarks Commission in 2002.
In 2001, the company formed a holding company named MGE Energy, Inc. and Madison Gas and Electric Co. became its main subsidiary.
Electricity[edit]
The company owns, operates and manages electric generating facilities and electric distribution facilities. The utility serves 146,000 electric customers, including the city of Madison and some suburban communities in Dane County.
Owned generating facilities:

Blount Generating Station

Combustion turbines and solar units at Madison, Wisconsin

History[edit]
The company's roots in the Madison area date back more than 150 years to its predecessor company, the Madison Gas Light and Coke Co., which was founded in 1855. The Madison Electric Light and Power Co. began delivering electric service in 1888. At the time, Madison had a population of 13,000.
In 1892, the Four Lakes Light and Power Co. bought Madison Electric Light and Power Co. and operated as Madison's electricity provider for the next four years.
In 1896, the Four Lakes Light and Power Company and the Madison City Gas Light and Coke Co. combined and incorporated to become Madison Gas and Electric Co.
The Madison Gas and Electric Company Powerhouse was built in 1902. In 1915, it was remodeled at a cost of $150,000. The building was designated a landmark by the Madison Landmarks Commission in 2002.
In 2001, the company formed a holding company named MGE Energy, Inc. and Madison Gas and Electric Co. became its main subsidiary.
Electricity[edit]
The company owns, operates and manages electric generating facilities and electric distribution facilities. The utility serves 146,000 electric customers, including the city of Madison and some suburban communities in Dane County.
Owned generating facilities:

Blount Generating Station
West Campus Cogeneration Facility
Combustion turbines and solar units at Madison, Wisconsin
Columbia Energy Center at Portage, Wisconsin
Natural gas combustion turbine at Marinette, Wisconsin
MGE's Rosiere Wind Farm in Kewaunee County, Wisconsin
Top of Iowa Wind Farm in north-central Iowa

The company also has long-term electric purchase power agreements.
Natural gas[edit]
The company purchases natural gas and owns distribution facilities to serve its customers. The utility serves 152,000 natural gas customers throughout the city of Madison, some suburban communities in Dane County and six other Wisconsin counties.
Green energy options[edit]
MGE has a green energy program called Green Power Tomorrow. Customers have the option of purchasing renewable energy for their home and/or business. In addition, the company offers a solar energy buy-back program called Clean Power Partners.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Madison Gas & Electric Company has received 3.45 out of 5 stars based on 2 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

About us - Energy Factor



















































        About us
      


Welcome to Energy Factor, an online resource covering the cutting-edge technology and innovations that are helping to meet tomorrow’s energy needs.
Sponsored by ExxonMobil, Energy Factor uncovers the untold stories that ultimately matter to all of us as we develop safe and reliable energy sources for the future. We highlight the communities and visionaries we collaborate with both in the U.S. and abroad to bring you informed, entertaining, and unexpected content.
We invite you to explore wide-ranging topics from the development of low-emission diesel fuel from algae, to the dramatic challenges of producing energy in some of the world’s most inhospitable places.
As we forge new paths in technology and science, Energy Factor gives you the opportunity to peer into tomorrow along with us through this bold multimedia publication.
Energy lives here.

Make a Difference on Earth Day
Enter our video contest for Grades 4-8. Students could win a party worth up to $500 for their classroom.
Here's how to enter. Students should:

Think of an activity for Earth Day in their home, school, park or other favorite place. Good examples are actions to save energy and reduce their carbon footprint. They can:
	
 Walk to school and they can record all the things around them that use energy.
 Record all the hours they use an appliance in their home for a week, like the TV or lighting. Learn about how much energy they use. Then make a video about their activities to reduce their family's energy use.
 Interview someone you know who owns an electric vehicle.
Make a video of their family creating a recycling area in the garage or backyard.
 
These are just a few ideas but we want them to develop their own. They can be creative on Earth Day and everyday!

Create a fun video capturing their Earth Day activity.
Work with their teacher to submit their entry to the YouTube website. And complete the entry form at: mge.com/earthday/entry

You can find the complete contest rules at: mge.com/earthday/rules

We will post the entries on our Facebook page so they can learn from other kids in your school and other Madison area schools.
Deadline for entry is May 1, 2017.


This contest is sponsored by:
