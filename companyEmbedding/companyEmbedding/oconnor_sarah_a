Who is Sarah O’Connor? 
Sarah O’Connor is living proof of the power of goal-oriented thinking. Building on her qualifications and experience promoting healthy lifestyles and fitness, Sarah set herself the goal of becoming a professional athlete and came through with flying colours – from competing in her first amateur event in 2011 to being awarded her professional competitor card in just two years.
Sarah’s journey reflects her personal mantra…
A goal is a dream with a ‘due by’ date
As a teen living in country South Australia, Sarah loved being outdoors and devoted lots of her time to competitive sport.  Her pastimes ranged from athletics and swimming to team sports and horse riding.  Sarah’s choice of university study built on that love – a Bachelors Degree in Exercise and Sport Science at Griffiths University in Queensland, Australia.
Sarah revelled in the lifestyle ‘up north’ on the sunny Queensland Gold Coast where a wide range of physical activities could feature in her fitness regime year round.  She took full advantage of those opportunities – running and walking on the beach, weight training, early morning boot camps, competitive beach volleyball, basketball and netball, to name a few.
Following university, Sarah practiced as an exercise physiologist and personal trainer.  Later, she moved back to South Australia where she spent time with family and worked with clients in a hospital-based gym.
Sarah went after her dream
In 2010, inspired by a motivational speaker who asked the audience to write down a lifetime goal – she entered the world of fitness competitions. While preparing for comp, Sarah experienced first hand the benefits of focusing on nutrition – the power of eating.  Sarah competed in her first State Title only six months later, winning first place for sports modelling.
2011 saw Sarah placing well in seven body building competitions.  She finished the year on a high, winning the INBA Natural Universe Overall Sports Model Title.
Sarah’s drive and determination carried through into 2012, earning her first place in every competition she entered.  The ‘crowning glory’ for Sarah was being awarded the 2012 Overall INBF Amateur World Figure Title in Atlantic City, USA and receiving her Pro-card.  In 2013, Sarah followed through with fourth in her first American Pro Figure competition.
Sarah O’Connor realises her goals while helping others reach theirs
Sarah’s career has gone from strength to strength both personally and professionally.  In 2013 Sarah launched her online training business, the success of which is evident in the testimonials received from her clients.  The success of Sarah’s competition preparation programs is demonstrated in her clients’ results.
Sarah is a winner!
2015 saw Sarah compete 10 times – 7 events in Australia and 1 event each in New Zealand, South Africa and America – winning or placing 2nd in her division at every event!
2016 was the highlight of her competing career (so far) seeing her compete 3 times, coming away with 3 wins and being awarded her WFF pro card.  Even more, Sarah took home the ultimate title of WFF Pro Ms Universe Sport Model 2016.
Sarah continues to shine as a competitor.
Sarah is…
Ms Universe 2016

Sarah O'Connor ... Ms Universe 2016

An exciting day for Sarah!

What a journey!
Thanks to my sponsors Green Tea x50, Kee Massage Therapy, @ OolalaCosmetics and @ CompTanAustralia
 
At WFF Worlds , Sarah competed in Sports Model & took away 2 titles:
Over 30’s Amateur Ms Universe
and
Pro Sport Model Ms Universe
 
Sarah says…
It’s a little surreal.
I’m now the proud holder of:

2 Amateur Universe Titles (2011 and 2016)
1 Pro Universe Title (2016)
1 Amateur World title (2012)


Not bad for someone who started competing at age 33!

A Natural Bodz star
> Back
Here’s an interesting fact…
Sarah started her body building ‘late’ at age 33, competing for the first time in 2011.
Sarah’s Natural Bodz Profile spread from 2012 gives the details…
South Australian born Sarah* began her journey into health and fitness at an early age.  She was house captain through high school and played a number of sports including basketball, netball, athletics, swimming and beach volley ball.  After high school she moved to the Gold Coast and earned her Bachelors Degree in Exercise Science.

In August 2010, Sarah set herself the goal of becoming a Pro Figure Athlete.  In 2011, she entered 7 sports/fitness model competitions placing in all 7 and finishing the year by winning the 2011 International Body Building Association (INBA) Natural Universe Tall Class Sports Model and overall Ms Sport Model Titles.
In November 2012, Sarah travelled to Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA, to compete in the International Natural Body Building Federation (INBF) world titles and returned home to Australia with the Overall Figure Amateur World Title.  Sarah  plans her first WNBF Pro Figure Competition in the USA in 2013.
The success Sarah has achieved in both Fitness Modelling and figure events is no doubt attributed to her years in the industry. She has launched her own website offering personal training plans to help others reach their personal health and fitness goals.

> Back
Sarah says…
I grew up in the Barossa Valley, South Australia.  I was sports house captain through high school and played a number of sports including basketball, netball, athletics, swimming and beach volley ball.  After high school, I moved to the Gold Coast and gained my Bachelors Degree in Exercise Science.  Over the years I have worked as a personal trainer, exercise physiologist, flight attendant and Medical Sales Rep.
I decided to turn my passion into what I do all the time.  I launched my website offering clients around the world online personal training and nutrition plans, 12 week challenges and accountability programs for all fitness levels.  I have a real passion to help as many people I can achieve their health, fitness and wellbeing goals.
When did your journey into health and fitness begin and was there anyone who inspired you to get involved in the industry?
I was at a sales conference for work in Port Douglas where Trevor Hendy was the guest speaker.  He told us to write down one thing that we always wanted to achieve in life.  I wrote down that I would like to compete in a fitness competition.  That marked the start of my competing career.

You have won a number of Sports Model and Fitness Model titles across various organisations. Can you list some of your achievements and any of the highlights of your competition career to date?

Do you feel that Fitness Modelling Events have opened the door to more competitors who otherwise would not or could not compete as a Figure competitor?
Yes, definitely.  I think the Fitness Model division is a lot more ‘achievable’ for people starting out and also provides a great foundation for those with a future goal of becoming a figure competitor.
> Back
With the introduction of Fitness Models rounds at the Qld ANB Asia Pacific, do you think that this has provided additional opportunities otherwise not available in the past?
Yes, the new fitness model category is a great division.  It provides a division for athletes who like to lean down further than what is required for sports model or bikini but do not want to be as muscular as a figure competitor or body builder.   I especially liked this division as it suited my body type.  It also provided a great stepping stone to advance into future.  I also think the fitness model round is great from the spectators’ point of view as it generally showcases the athletic and healthy look to which they aspire.
What’s the Fitness Scene like in your home town of Adelaide? There always seems to be a good number of competitors from SA…
Adelaide is starting to embrace the fitness lifestyle and is producing some fantastic athletes.  The Adelaide people really get behind the federations with the numbers of competitors growing every year.

There is a fine line between conditioning of a Figure athlete and a Fitness Model.  Do you think this is controlled more through dietary means or training?
Although weight lifting is imperative for building your underlying muscle and symmetry, the conditioning required for competing as a Figure athlete is largely based on your eating plan.  I do not believe in crash dieting.  My advice is to make it a priority to find an experienced nutritionist to tailor the right eating plan for you and your body type.  What works for me may not work for you.
> Back
Let’s talk about your exercise program.  How many days a week do you workout with weights and how much cardio work?
During competition season, I train one muscle group per day five days a week with an occasional full body circuit on the six day.  I have one complete day of rest per week and complete high intensity interval sprints 4-5 days per week leading up to a competition.
It takes a strong mind-set to hit the gym and stick to a clean diet plan.  How do you keep on track week after week leading up to a comp?
First of all I lock in my competitions for the year and set myself monthly and weekly targets.  I keep myself on target with visualisation.  To give you an example, last year I found a photo of the athlete who won the world title which I had set my sights on.  I put a picture of her standing on stage on my laptop screensaver.  Each and every morning I opened my laptop and visualised myself standing on that stage with that trophy  and imagined the feeling of achieving my goal.
> Back
I am a big believer that…
Goals are DREAMS with a ‘due by’ date.
What this means is dream big, set your ‘due by’ date.  However, make sure you set weekly targets to keep you on track to your end goal and, finally, visualise yourself daily achieving your dream.

Motivation or lack thereof, is often a stumbling block for most people… What is your biggest motivator, and what advice can you offer to others?
From a young age I have a really deep need to be the best I can be at everything I do.  This keeps me motivated every day.  My advice is to focus on yourself.  Don’t worry about what everyone else is doing.  Just put everything into doing your best.
At what point does exercising go from a positive lifestyle to an obsession and how can we prevent this?
I think that when you are finding that your rest days are the hardest days of the week, you are could be flirting with obsession and over training.  Rest and recovery is just as important as diet and training.  To help prevent an exercising obsession, I make sure rest days are scheduled into every weekly training plan I write.
> Back
If you could only do three exercises, what would they be in order of importance?
Legs, back and interval sprints.
Do you prefer to split your routine and, if so, what is your current split?
My weight training split is shoulders, back, legs, chest and abs, biceps and triceps.
What sort of cardio and how long would you spend per session on average?
I find high intensity interval sprints are the most effective way to lean down.  I generally do 20-15mins.

Teena found the answer at 46
Stats: Loss of 3.4kg and 58.4cm (My pants were tight before the challenge)
> Back
I’ve always been fairly active and had a relatively healthy diet (or so I thought).
After having children (1 singleton and twins) I had stacked on some weight, so decided to go to Weight Watchers.  I lost weight and then, at the age of 40, I signed up for my first fun run and took up jogging.
Things were going along quite well – up until I got sick and was diagnosed with Glandular Fever.  Because I had glandular fever for over 8 months my liver began to fail and I was constantly fatigued and felt like I had the flu all the time.  Worst of all, I stacked on all the weight that I had lost, plus a little bit more.  I tried to keep exercising but I had no energy – so it was a vicious cycle.
Over weight and not exercising… NOT my problem!
A friend started to deal with an online personal trainer, so I decided to give him a go.  Unfortunately, after 3 months, I had only lost a little weight and I felt like I was just wasting my money.  I think he was used to dealing with overweight people who didn’t exercise.  This wasn’t my problem and he offered little advice to help.
I noticed a friend of mine – Debbie Block – had made some amazing transformations.  She looked amazing and I wondered what she had been doing.  I also thought there was NO WAY I could do what she was doing – she was so toned and muscular – I was too old and unfit to even try it right?
I wasn’t interested in competing but I really wanted to lose weight and tone up
But, my curiosity got the better of me so I asked her what she had been doing and she told me that she had an eating and exercise plan from Sarah O’Connor.  I wasn’t interested in competing but I really wanted to lose weight and tone up – and I wondered if Sarah could help me.  Debbie assured me that Sarah could help – so I sent an email to find out!
Sarah organized a time to call me – I told her all about my past, what had happened to my liver, my non-existent metabolism and how frustrated I was – because all of a sudden I’d gone from being fit and slim – to a lumpy, tired and defeated person who felt like the battle with my weight and health was a uphill climb!!
I signed up… one day before my birthday and two weeks before Christmas and New Years!
Sarah said she would help so I signed up for the 8 week challenge.  I was apprehensive because it was the 14th of December, one day before my birthday and two weeks before Christmas and New Years!! But, I did it anyway – and it was the best decision of my life!
The first four weeks were pretty tough – I had cravings and a lot of bad habits to eliminate!
And, eating 6 meals a day was a real challenge!!  To lose weight you have to eat lettuce all day right?  NO!! Sarah told me to trust her and the process, so I did!
I noticed that the measurements were going down…
I chose my birthday as my first cheat meal, Christmas Day for another and New Year’s for another (and it was more than 2 hours!!).  My weight fluctuated and I didn’t lose much at all – but I noticed that the measurements were going down.  I was FINALLY toning up – and losing weight in areas that I’d never been able to lose it before – arms, thighs and glutes!
Preparing my food 3 days in advance has saved me time and money!!  There is no chance of me grabbing junk food anymore because my food is ready to go!
I started to lose weight…
Slowly but surely, with lots of guidance and encouragement from Sarah, I started to lose weight – and the last 4 weeks I lost weight every week – and, best of all, I lost lots of centimetres!  My pants were looser, I didn’t have to jump up and down to get my pants over my hips – I was getting RESULTS!!  Other people were starting to notice and commenting on how good I was looking.
I feel great!
Best of all I FEEL great – the great food has made my insides feel clean; the intake of 2-3 litres of water has improved my complexion.
I still like to have my cheat meal – but don’t feel deprived the other days of the week.  And, I’m finding that making the healthier choice is so much easier because I actually prefer the taste!
I am 46 years old and I think I’ve finally found the secret to success!  I am confident that I will reach my goal weight – but I have learnt that it’s not about the scales any more – it’s more about how I feel and how I look!
… this system does work!!
For anyone who is serious about making a change in their life for the better – this system does work!!  There are no pills or potions – it’s all about eating the right food at the right time and incorporating some exercise and weights to help tone.
It’s not easy – but it’s something that is achievable and can be maintained for the rest of my life!
And, my life will be longer because I am fuelling my body with goodness.
Thank you Sarah!!
There aren’t enough words to describe how much I appreciate what you have done for me.

Changes for Bonnie
> Back
New Zealand-based client Bonnie Ridley was 7 weeks into a program with me when she sent through this message.
Hey Sarah
I really wanted to say thank you for all your help… particularly how reassuring and understanding you have been. Also, thank you for the time you took explaining the reasoning behind certain things I am eating and why I should, the effects on my body, and also your help with the training I should do. It means a lot.
All the help you have given me since being with you over the last 2 months is crazy and it truly has helped me get back on my feet. After my last comp I really did spiral out of control. I hit such a low point due to a combination of injury meaning I could not train and then relationship factors; I took it all out on myself through food. I had such a negative outlook on food that ranged from secret eating and binge eating to not eating at all.
To be honest, part of me never thought I could get back into shape again.  I got really bad anxiety over the way I looked.  I was even too embarrassed to go to the gym anymore because I was worried people would make fun of the weight I had put on… which sounds so silly when I write it down.
I put my original start up photo next to my 7 week update photo and I can’t believe how much has changed. I’m embarrassed I ever got to the first photo but so motivated to see what I was able to achieve and get my body looking like in 7 weeks thanks to your help. So excited to see what we can bring to stage!
Your nutrition and training plan and guidance has helped so much more than you probably realise. Not just physically, but mentally. So, thank you so much for helping me become comfortable in my own skin again, realising I am capable of bigger and better things and restoring my relationship with food and nutrition.
I have so much admiration and respect for you.
Thanks again. xx

Belinda says it all!
> Back
I first started with Sarah about 12 months ago. I found out about her through social media. I got in contact with her and straight away I found her to be such a lovely person.
We talked about goals
 
We talked about goals and what I was aiming for. I signed up for a 12 Week Challenge to lose some weight and tone up. With Sarah’s help I started training and went on a nutrition plan.  As the 12 weeks went by I received emails every week from her… some had expert info about nutrition or training and others were an accountability survey.
The expert info was awesome.  It gave that personal touch and also helped to explain and teach methods for training, eating and your overall well being. Each week I sent back the survey and within a couple of days Sarah would be in touch answering any questions I had and giving words of encouragement to help keep me motivated and on the right track.
Knowing Sarah believed in me made all the difference
> Back
Even though some weeks it was hard, to know that she was there and believed in me made all the difference!
At the end of the 12 weeks I wasn’t where I wanted to be. So, I spoke with Sarah.  I was so happy with all the help she had already given me I decided to continue with her for an 8 Week Challenge.  I had a pretty good reason to give it my all in the upcoming 8 weeks as it took me right up until my wedding day!!
It took me right up to my wedding day
 
Having a serious goal in mind made a big difference.  All Sarah wanted for me on my wedding day was to look my best!! Similar to the 12 Week Challenge, I received an accountability survey every week.  It really helped me to keep on track and I was able to let Sarah know how I was feeling and where I was up to in the whole process!!
Every time I felt like I was struggling or felt down Sarah was there to remind me of how good I could feel and look on my wedding day! She was right.
The hard work was worth it!
 
When I look back at the photos I can see the hard work that went into those 8 weeks. with all the ups and downs.  It was worth it. I felt beautiful and all I wanted to do was send Sarah a pic so she could see that we made it!!!
After the wedding we stayed in contact.  I was starting to get so used to the training and nutrition that I wanted to keep going, I wanted a new goal. Sarah and I talked again and we decided that I would compete in Season A 2016. Prep began in January.
Sarah tailored programs for me
 
Being a part of TeamOC is one of the BEST and most AMAZING experiences I have had and I will be forever grateful for having Sarah behind me through the prep. I am from a very small country town.  It has a second hand gym with old weight machines and limited equipment. I went through with Sarah what was available to me and she was able to tailor programs for me in detail.  If there was ever anything I was not able to do with the limited equipment I had available, I would let Sarah know and she would give me an alternative straight away.
Comp day was awesome!
> Back
When it was comp day, I was competing on my own but Sarah was there by the phone the whole time. Throughout the whole day we kept in contact.  After each class I went out in I would talk to her straight away, send photos and have her coach me as the day went on. It was so awesome!
I could not be happier with what Sarah has provided for me. I have learnt so much from her.  To have started with the challenges and then become a part of TeamOC has been so rewarding.  I feel so lucky to not only call Sarah my coach but one of my beautiful friends. We have been able to build an awesome relationship and without all her help with training, knowledge and nutrition I would not be where I am today. I have found a love of life, passion and happiness and I could not be more grateful to Sarah.

Danni's lifestyle change
> Back
I’ve always enjoyed going to the gym, I love lifting weights and I’m addicted to that feeling you get after smashing a great cardio session.
My food plan that’s tailored exactly to my (fussy) eating is amazing. I really enjoy eating food from it instead of eating it because it’s healthy and I want results or because I have to.  It’s a real lifestyle change.
In saying this, you cannot reach your goals until you believe you can achieve them. Having you there to support, encourage, guide and motivate me through these 12 weeks has been a blessing and I couldn’t have done this without you. It’s such a mind game but seeing these changes has motivated me to keep going through the silly season and strive towards achieving my goals.
Thank you. Xx

From Rhys - competitor!
> Back
Some time back, I set myself a 15 week goal to get up on stage at the INBA Queensland titles in Australia.  I achieved it but in no way was this an easy task.  No partying, so many nights in, food prep, 2 hours of training a day, water loading and depletion.  So much you need to go through, but…
I enjoyed the process … loved it
I have so much respect for athletes that compete in the fitness and bodybuilding industry, now more then ever.  The dedication and the drive you need to achieve this goal has to be intense or you will fail.
During the 15 weeks comp prep, my coaches Sarah O’Connor and Grant Pieterse stuck with me and pushed me through to what I look like today.
I found out 7 weeks into it that I was gluten and lactose intolerant and had to change my whole diet and start from scratch.  I am so glad to have had the opportunity to learn about nutrition and training with competing from the very best coaches.
12.5kg down and 13% body fat loss is the best feeling ever
It’s time to learn more about the process!  I am so excited to get back out there with a better rig then before.  Can’t thank my coaches enough xx

Sara's recommendation
> Back
I was originally recommended to Sarah by a friend for a healthy sustainable off-season meal plan.  It became very clear early on how committed to her clients Sarah is, and how motivating and caring she is.
Sarah is something special
Sara Stockham – ANB Sports Model Bikini round
This actually inspired me to compete again!  I have competed before with other coaches but Sarah is something special.  We kept in contact almost daily, and she provided me with answers to my questions almost immediately throughout the whole prep, as well as posting me her theme wear to borrow!
Sarah was always there for me all hours of the day or night.  She always gave me positive energy that would always lift my spirit if I was doubting myself or questioning my progress.
… so helpful and supportive
I was most impressed with how comprehensive the Peak Week and post-competition reverse dieting and training regime was.  This is where I struggled last time I competed and it was so refreshing to know that Sarah valued this part of the journey so highly and was so helpful and supportive.
With her coaching, Sarah provides weekly expert advice and on-line progress surveys, frequent telephone calls, and is available 24/7.  She was also comp prepping at the same time, and never put her own clients second.
She has become somebody I look up to, and would call a mentor and a friend.  Sarah is inspirational and so supportive.  Sarah and her team work closely to provide the best nutritional and training programs to achieve absolutely the best results no matter what your goals are.
I would recommend Sarah to anybody
The training programs are challenging, but fun, and change every few weeks, which I loved.  I would recommend Sarah to anybody wanting online competition prepping, or even just guidance with training or maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
Even though my competition season is over, I know Sarah is somebody I will always keep in touch with.  I am feeling the healthiest and happiest I have ever been.
Thanks for being amazing.

From Danni - Winner!

Danni Quinlivan says…
This competition prep experience has been one of the most fulfilling and life changing experiences I have had to date. I am beyond thankful to Sarah O’Connor.  I will never go anywhere else for coaching or nutrition.  Sarah’s own success is a testament to Sarah’s professionalism and capability in the field of fitness, sport, nutrition and competing.
Since competing, I feel like I walk taller, am stronger mentally, emotionally and physically, am more confident, make better choices (food and non-food related) and am all round happier.
Anyone can go to the gym and eat ‘clean’ but it takes a very specialised person, with in-depth-knowledge, to be able to successfully coach someone to get ready for a body building stage.
I’m a 29 year old accountant who sits down all day, had a terrible diet and a serious sweet tooth, yet Sarah transformed me into a 2nd place IFBB Bikini division winner.
There is no way I could have done this one my own and I owe it all to Sarah.
Sarah’s own success is a testament to Sarah’s professionalism and capability in the field of fitness, sport, nutrition and competing.
Even though I didn’t have any local TEAM OC competitors (in Perth, Western Australia) I still felt very much a part of Sarah’s team.  Sarah was always only a phone call or email away and she was always there for me.   Sarah’s information and eXpert Info files were always so thorough and extremely helpful.  A critical component of the service she provides.  These are great. 
The smaller things – like the weekly count down emails – were also a nice touch in the personalised service.  The YouTube motivation videos where also an A+ resource.  It helped me to source my own motivational videos as well.  I would regularly listen to them at work with a head set on just to zone out.

Courtney sums it up
> Back
I was recommended to Sarah by a friend in the gym who had previously competed using Sarah’s comp prep.  I have always dreamed of competing and finally threw away doubts and fears and signed up with Sarah after chatting to her.
Throughout prep I had many questions for Sarah.  I even doubted her advice sometimes but I always listened and she always explained why we took certain approaches.  Everything always made sense and she always put my health first.
Even being online and having Sarah prepping for the competition worked too.
Sarah was always so supportive.
I love all my meals and loved the training program.  It changed every few weeks and was individualised to my needs.  Sarah was honest at each check in and helped me focus on my goal towards stage.  At the competition Sarah was by my side helping and giving me the confidence that I needed!
After comp Sarah made sure to check in with me.  Even after months Sarah still chats and checks in on how my fitness is going.  She is so down to earth and caring, I recommend all who are interested in comp prep to Sarah!
Best experience!

O’Connor 1
Abstract
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme found in almost all living cells. It is a 
tetramer, and takes pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, and converts it to lactate, as well
as converts it to lactate, as well as converting NADH to NAD
+
. The LDHA gene was 
previously amplified using PCR, and isolated from the pET plasmid from 
E. coli
. The 
LDHA gene was eventually ligated with 
E. coli
T4 DNA Ligase. This ligation product of 
the LDHA gene was chemically transformed to make them competent cells. The plasmid
was purified and restriction analysis was used to determine the identity of the plasmid. 
Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to determine the success of the LDH-pET digest 
from another group’s colonies, since most of the class had no colonies after 
transformation. The protein sequences of the human and chicken LDHA gene were 
aligned and compared with a percent matrix of 84.89%, and the LDHA gene in 
E. coli
underwent screening expression to determine what induction conditions best express 
the LDH protein.
Introduction
Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) is found in nearly all cells and is a tetramer. LDH 
has 5 isoforms that are all homo-tetramers and hetero-tetramers that differ in subunit 
composition, in which the number of muscle (M) subunit encoded by LDHA gene and 
heart (H) subunit encoded by LDHB gene vary. LDH takes pyruvate, the final product of 
glycolysis, and converts it to lactate and takes NADH and converts it to NAD
+
, and is 
considered a reversible reaction (Augoff). To purify lactate dehydrogenase, or any 
protein, purification is performed at optimal pH, low temperature (4°C), minimum time, 
and minimized exposure to proteases.









O’Connor 2
Before transformation, the LDHA gene was amplified using PCR (Polymerase 
Chain Reaction), which produces multiple copies of the particular DNA fragment using a
template DNA sequence, two oglionucleotide primers flanking this sequence, a 
thermostable DNA polymerase, and dNTPs (deoxyribose nucleoside triphosphates) 
(Garibyan). The LDHA gene was then cut out using restriction enzymes, which are 
produced by bacteria and recognize specific sequences in dsDNA (double-stranded 
DNA), and cleave at or near the site (Berg). The LDHA gene was then ligated using T4 
DNA Ligase, which forms two covalent phosphodiester bonds between the 3’ OH ends 
of one nucleotide with the 5’ P end of another nucleotide. The two separate DNA 
molecules collide with each other and stick, and the T4 DNA Ligase seals the DNA 
molecules together with ATP (Wilson). 
The ligation reaction of the LDHA gene undergoes the process of transformation.
