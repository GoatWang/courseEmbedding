Ignyta Seems To Be On Track With Entrectinib - Ignyta, Inc. (NASDAQ:RXDX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Ignyta Seems To Be On Track With EntrectinibNov.18.15 | About: Ignyta, Inc. (RXDX) Shark Traders Long/short equity, momentum, short-term horizon, bondssharktraders.comSummaryRXDX just announced that it sold $30 million worth of common stocks to Eli Lilly and Company.
        Phase 1 of Entrectinib showed positive results and Phase 2 has been initiated in September 2015.
        RXDX R&D expenses increased in Q3 2015 compared to the same quarter last year, which indicates the money is being used in a productive way.
        Cantor Fitzgerald started covering RXDX and issued a buy rating after its Q3 2015 earnings report was published.
        Company Overview
Ignyta Inc (NASDAQ:RXDX) is a biotechnology company involved in developing precision drugs for cancer patients. Ignyta Inc mainly targets patients with tumors and try to design drugs based on a strategy called Rx/Dx.
Rx/Dx strategy is known as the integrated therapeutic and diagnostic system that tries to guess a potential solution for curing the tumors by pairing each of the solutions with biomarker-based companion diagnostics. Hence, the product candidates of Ignyta Inc would help a very narrow pool of patients who have a higher probability of getting cured.
Currently, Ignyta Inc has several product candidates in the pipeline, including RXDX-101, now known as Entrectinib. After Seeking Alpha contributor Steven Breazzano did a great job profiling the company in February 2014, there have been several major developments over the last 20 months. We believe investors would benefit from an updated analysis of the recent key developments.
 
Ignyta Inc has several internal discovery stage programs known as Spark programs and a handful of other product candidates in the pipeline. However, we will only discuss about its most promising product candidate, the Entrectinib ((RXDX-101)) and recent financial developments.
 Entrectinib Phase 2 Clinical Trial Began
 Followers of Ignyta Inc may already know that Entrectinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of TrkA, TrkB and TrkC, as well as ROS1 and ALK.
Figure 1: Ignyta Inc Stock Spiked Over 110 Percent After Releasing Phase 1 Clinical Trial Data of Entrectinib

On June 1, 2015, Ignyta Inc released the Phase 1 clinical trial data of Entrectinib and announced that they have found the recommended Phase 2 dose. Within days of releasing the clinical trial data of the Phase 1, Ignyta Inc stock price spiked to $18.75 per share, representing a 110 percent increase.
In September 2015, Ignyta Inc participated in the 2015 European Cancer Congress ((ECC 2015)) in Vienna, Austria and discussed about the interim results from Phase 1. During the ECC 2015, Ignyta Inc said that their ALKA-372-001 and STARTRK-1 studies had a total 92 patients who received solid tumor doses in a varied range.
During these two clinical trials, Ignyta Inc found that patients tolerated the Entrectinib doses very well. However, some of the adverse side effects caused due to the treatment included fatigue, dysgeusia, paresthesia, nausea, and myalgia. They said there were only three serious adverse events. Nonetheless, once the dose was modified, all these events became reversible and Ignyta Inc was able to resolve the issues.
 
Out of the 92 participants in the Phase 1, only 18 participants met the Phase 2 eligibility criteria. Later, only 9 patients remained on the treatment plan with durable responses of up to 21 treatment cycles. The studies concluded that Entrectinib can have an objective tumor response in the central nervous system.
Current Financial SituationFigure 2: Ignyta Inc's Total Expenses Compared to Its Cash and Equivalents
Since Ignyta Inc currently does not market any products, it does not have any top line. Hence, investors have to keep an eye on the burn rate of the company. By the end of Q3 2015, Ignite Inc had a cash and equivalents of $57.57 million and total expenses of around $14.3 million.

Earlier this month, Ignyta Inc announced that it has obtained an exclusive license for the taladegib oncology development program from Eli Lilly for $2 million cash payment and an additional 1.2 million common stocks.
Concurrently, Eli Lilly entered into a stock purchase agreement with Ignyta Inc and bought an additional 1.5 million common shares of Ignyta Inc at $20 per share. It means they have effectively invested $30 million in the company.
At the current burn rate, Ignyta Inc would be able to continue its operation for at least two more quarters based on its current level of liquidity. However, if we include the available-for-sale securities, it would have $163.1 million on the books against only $31 million in long-term debt.
In the third quarter of 2015, out of the $14.3 million expense, $10.4 million went into its research and development. Compared to only $8.6 million in Q3 2014, this represents a 21 percent increase. It is always good to know that the bulk of the initial funding is being spent on R&D. The general and administrative expenses were only $3.9 million.
ConclusionEarlier this week, Cantor Fitzgerald started coverage for Ignyta Inc and issued a buy rating after its Q3 2015 EPS came out at -$0.49, a solid -$0.11 higher than Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of -$0.60.
Although getting FDA approval for the Entrectinib is still a matter of the distant future, the Phase 1 study showed promising results.
With the stock purchase agreement with Eli Lilly, Ignyta Inc has secured its liquidity situation in the short term and with promising results from Phase 2, it would be much easier to raise additional funds if needed.
In September 2015, the STARTRK-2 Phase 2 clinical trial of Entrectinib was initiated. In this trial, 100 leading cancer centers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia would allow their patients to participate. We can only hope the results come bearing good news.
 
We believe the overall good financial standing of the company along with the latest developments around its lead product candidate, Entrectinib, indicates that Ignyta Inc is on course to become a leading precision oncology biotechnology company. Secondary investors should carefully follow and study this company as we believe the stock price has huge upside potential in the long-run.

Ignyta, Inc. Granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Entrectinib by U.S. Food and Drug Administration
May 15 17
Ignyta, Inc. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) to entrectinib for the treatment of NTRK fusion-positive, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors in adult and pediatric patients who have either progressed following prior therapies or who have no acceptable standard therapies. Entrectinib is the company’s investigational, orally available, CNS-active tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting tumors that harbor NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, or ALK gene fusions. The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite development and review timelines of potential new medicines for use in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

			Ignyta Clinical Trials		


admin 


			2016-12-01T11:23:43+00:00		

Rx/Dx and Cancer Clinical Trial EnrollmentReferring patients to clinical trials can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Furthermore, even if that referral is successful, by entering a trial, the patient risks losing the personal care of the physician he or she has come to know and trust. At Ignyta, we’re working to streamline the referral and evaluation process, cutting the time from first contact to trial enrollment to reduce the burden on both patient and provider.
Our unique Rx/Dx ability and our heritage in molecular diagnostics allow us to more efficiently confirm results of local molecular patient screening for trial enrollment. Ignyta’s central diagnostics lab also handles testing for clinical sites to help pinpoint difficult-to-find eligible patients who would otherwise miss gaining access to our investigational therapies. Working with community oncologists, we can ensure the patient is cared for and that the doctor/patient relationship is preserved throughout the clinical trial process.
Both Patients and Providers Have Concerns About TrialsFor some patients with cancers that have been resistant to treatment, clinical trials for therapies in development are not just an interesting option – they may be their only hope. This fact motivates Ignyta to keep both patient and provider concerns top-of-mind when structuring and conducting trials. Knowing that both patients and providers are acutely concerned about the availability of trials, Ignyta is continually building an ever-growing network of study sites to bring trials closer to patients across the US and around the globe.
Accessibility is one thing; enrollment is another. The trials testing and enrollment process can be challenging for both the patient and the provider. Our exclusive Rx/Dx capability, along with in-house molecular diagnostic (Dx) testing, keeps the entire process under one roof, providing the smoothest possible enrollment process and the best communication, with the least red tape.
We believe consistent attention to both patient and provider concerns results in the best experience and the best outcomes for both.
 ×
Leading Concerns About Clinical Trial Participation

For Patients:

Location/Travel: “I’m too far away from any of the medical centers that do the trials.”
Awareness: “Information about side effects,” “If they work or not.”
Accessibility: “Getting access to them, or even learning about them…”

For Providers:

Convenience: “Time to discuss, geographic location of the trial, and distance from patient”
Location: “Travel and then follow-up if it cannot be done locally”
Patient Eligibility: “Exclusion criteria: I don’t want to waste the patient’s and family’s time sending them to the institution to find out they don’t qualify.”
Patient Retention: “Fear of losing the patient.”

			NTRK Fusions		


admin 


			2017-02-13T13:05:07+00:00		

Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase 1 – NTRK FusionsThe neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinases are a family of genes (NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3) that encode the proteins TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, respectively. They function as receptors that span the cell membrane, sensing extracellular signals, like the binding of neurotrophin molecules, and transferring the signal to the cell’s intracellular environment through kinase activity. Trk receptors are particularly essential to neuronal development.1, 2 The aberrant expression of rearranged NTRK genes, encoding Trk fusion proteins, has been detected in a wide range of cancers (e.g., salivary gland cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer) and suggests that signaling by these receptors may be important in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, and/or apoptosis in the subset of patients whose tumors harbor such gene fusions (see Table 1). It is thought that an NTRK fusion that joins the kinase portion of the gene to various N-terminal partners (as described below) results in their constitutive activation in a ligand-independent manner.1,2
NTRK1One of the first receptor kinases found to be involved in a fusion event that led to the development of cancer was neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase type 1 (NTRK1), which encodes the protein TrkA. This gene was originally identified as a fusion oncogene in colon carcinoma.3,4 TrkA is a 140 kDa glycoprotein comprised of an extracellular (N-terminal) ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.4 Upon binding to its ligand, nerve growth factor (NGF), TrkA dimerizes and undergoes autophosphorylation of its intracellular domain. This results in subsequent activation of intracellular signaling molecules, including RAS, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), thus stimulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival.4,5
Abnormal expression of the TrkA protein was recently identified in tumor and liver metastases of a patient with colorectal cancer who was refractory to standard therapy. Molecular characterization unveiled a novel fusion between the LMNA and NTRK1 genes within chromosome 1, resulting in the formation of a fusion oncogene (LMNA–NTRK1) with transforming potential.6 The patient was treated with a Trk inhibitor, entrectinib, and achieved a partial response, which was maintained for approximately 5 months (March 2014 – July 2014). This was the first clinical evidence of efficacy for therapeutic inhibition of TrkA using a Trk inhibitor in a solid tumor.6
In lung cancer patients, one study identified NTRK1 rearrangements in 3 of 91 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (3.3%), and this study also identified 2 additional gene fusion partners for NTRK1: MPRIP and CD74, both of which resulted in constitutive activation of the resulting fusion kinase and were also oncogenic (Table 1). 7 As in colorectal cancer, there is also evidence for therapeutic inhibition of lung tumors with NTRK1 rearrangements; during Phase I trials, one patient with metastatic lung cancer harboring an NTRK1 rearrangement displayed a partial response to entrectinib, including a complete response for all brain metastases.8
NTRK1 fusion events are now being more widely screened for and increasingly recognized across multiple cancer types. A recent survey of Northeastern US patients with pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma (N=28), for example, identified a single patient (4%) with diffuse follicular papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) harboring a fusion between the gene translocated promoter region (TPR) and NTRK1.9 Another recent study identified the previously described LMNA– NTRK1 and a fusion between tropomyosin 3 TPM3–NTRK1 fusion genes in a total of 3 of 147 patients (2%) from a Korean colon cancer population using next-generation RNA sequencing.10 This study found that tumors harboring these NTRK1 gene rearrangements did not have somatic mutations in other oncogenes like KRAS, NRAS, or PIK3CA, and both fusion proteins were shown to be oncogenic, as their expression in NIH3T3 cells resulted in transformation and tumor formation in immunocompromised mice.10 In a sampling of 140 Spitzoid skin neoplasms, which included 75 Spitz naevi, 32 atypical Spitz tumors, and 33 Spitzoid melanomas, NTRK1 rearrangements were detected in a total of 16.4% of the samples (23 patients), with 8, 8, and 7 patients, respectively, harboring rearrangements in the respective tumor types.11
NTRK2TrkB, which is encoded by the NTRK2 gene, was identified in 1991 to be a functional receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), but unlike TrkA, it does not bind to NGF.12,13 When expressed in cell lines, TrkB has been shown to regulate cellular effects for both BDNF and NT-3, although NT-3 is the weaker of the 2 known ligands.12,13 Like TrkA, ligand binding to TrkB causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of its catalytic domain, resulting in the activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including the RAS-MAPK, phospholipase-C gamma (PLCg), and PI3K pathways, which mediate its cellular effects.2 Some of the implicated roles for altered TrkB signaling in cancer include its role in suppressing anoikis, or apoptosis in response to loss of cell matrix interaction (thereby promoting a more invasive phenotype), and a potential role of the BDNF/TrkB-signaling axis in overcoming resistance to other cancer therapies, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, as previously observed in colon cancer cells.14,15
Like NTRK1, gene fusion events involving NTRK2 are also becoming increasingly recognized in various cancers. Two novel NTRK2 rearrangements were identified in a study conducted by the International Cancer Genome Consortium and PedBrain Tumor Project, which examined 96 pilocytic astrocytomas, the most common form of childhood brain tumor.16 In both cases, expression of the aberrant fusion kinase resulted in ligand-independent dimerization and constitutive activation of the kinase.16 Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas has also recorded novel fusions involving NTRK2 in lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell head and neck cancer, and low-grade glioma (Table 1).
NTRK3TrkC, encoded by NTRK3, is the primary receptor for NT-3, and like TrkB and TrkA, it mediates the effects of its ligand on neuronal growth and differentiation during development.2 In 1998, a fusion between the NTRK3 gene and an ets-type transcription factor (ETV6, also called TEL) was reported in congenital fibrosarcoma (CFS). This fusion transcript encoded a protein with a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, believed to be involved in dimerization, fused to the protein tyrosine kinase domain of TrkC.18.19 The resultant fusion protein was subsequently shown to result in dysregulation of downstream signaling pathways.18, 20
In 2003, a fusion between ETV6 and the NTRK3 gene was also found to be expressed in human secretory breast cancers (SBC), a rare but clinically distinct subtype of breast cancer.17 Transcripts for this fusion were detected in 11 of 12 SBC cases (92%).17 In a recent survey of Northeastern US patients with pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC; N=28), a total of 6 patients (22%) with varying PTC phenotypes were found to harbor an NTRK3 fusion, most commonly with the ETV6 gene (n=5 of 6 cases, 1 unknown fusion partner).9 Interestingly, the high incidence (26% overall) of NTRK1 and NTRK3 rearrangements in the pediatric PTC population in this study (overall 26%) was notably higher than that reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for adult PTC, as well as that observed in sporadic and radiation-induced PTCs.9
The STARTRK-2 trial is enrolling patients with NTRK, ROS1, and ALK fusions.

			Rx – Precision Medicine Pipeline

Precision Medicine (Rx) Pipeline: Ignyta’s Molecularly Targeted TherapiesAt Ignyta, our Rx (therapeutic) efforts are focused on developing and commercializing molecularly targeted therapies that help eradicate cancer. We believe these powerful precision medicines represent the future of cancer treatment, giving healthcare providers new tools in the battle against molecularly defined malignancies.
Learn more below about Ignyta’s portfolio of precision therapeutics in development, and visit our clinical trials page to find out more about getting your patients enrolled in a trial of one of Ignyta’s groundbreaking targeted therapies.
 
Take a Look into Ignyta’s Development PipelineOur precision medicine (Rx) pipeline, working hand-in-hand with our molecular diagnostic (Dx) technologies, creates the combined Rx/Dx capability that sets Ignyta apart from others, resulting in potentially faster determination of patient eligibility for an Ignyta clinical trial.
  By taking several different approaches to halt cancer progression, Ignyta is developing and commercializing molecularly targeted therapies that, sequentially or in combination, eradicate residual disease.
Entrectinib – Targeting NTRK, ROS1, ALK fusionsCurrently undergoing STARTRK-2, a global, potentially registration enabling Phase 2 clinical trial, entrectinib is a potent, CNS-active, orally available, selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, ROS1, and ALK proteins. This product candidate was designed to target cancers harboring activating molecular alterations to the corresponding subset of oncogenes. Learn more about gene fusions in cancer, data from the entrectinib ongoing Phase I and Phase II trials, and clinical responses. Click here to Learn more about Entrectinib (RXDX-101), and NTRK, ROS1, and ALK Fusions, as well as data from the entrectinib ongoing Phase I and Phase II trials, and clinical responses.
RXDX-105 – Targeting RET and Other Kinase TargetsAn orally available, VEGF-sparing, potent RET inhibitor. A Phase Ib basket study of RXDX-105 is currently underway.
Learn more about RET fusions.
Taladegib – Targeting Hh/SMOA small molecule hedgehog/smoothened inhibitor. In normal cells, the hedgehog molecule acts as a ligand that can bind the smoothened transmembrane receptor and set off a signaling cascade that can influence early development and replication of adult stem cell populations. Stem cells that acquire molecular changes activating the hedgehog/smoothened pathway can transform into tumor precursors; this process has been implicated in some forms of brain cancer, skin cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Targeting these stem cells in combination with other therapeutics could potentially help eradicate residual disease.
RXDX-106 – Targeting TYRO3, AXL, MERRXDX-106 is a small molecule, pseudo-irreversible inhibitor of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases.  This product candidate is currently in late-stage preclinical development. RXDX-106 binds to each of its targets – for example, as a TYRO3 inhibitor – and forms non-covalent bonds with a slow off-rate that ensure continued signaling attenuation long after the molecule becomes undetectable in the patient’s serum. This could translate into a short half-life followed by a longer period of potential tumor-suppressing activity. It also appears to potentiate the immune system, particularly in combination with other agents.
Learn more about Pan-TAM Inhibitors.

More than a Job – A Difference: People, Culture, and Careers

At Ignyta, we believe that our mission starts with creating a truly great place to work, where people can bring the best parts of themselves to bear on some of humanity’s greatest challenges. We want to be more than a leading biotech company, working to create groundbreaking cancer drugs. We want Ignyta to be a truly great company.


From the Ignyta 2016 Employee Survey
The single thing that inspires people most about Ignyta is the focus on results for patients, and the feeling that they’re making a difference in cancer research and treatment for actual people. Second is the sense of inspiration they feel from consistently working with smart, motivated people who do great work.

 As you’ll read on our Vision & Values page, this is The Flame, the thing that unites us:
“We are passionate about working on superior products that improve our patients’ lives, we are warmly loyal to each other and to those we work with (partners, collaborators), and for (patients, shareholders), and we are a company of self-starters seeking to be the best at what we do.”
The People of Ignyta
We recently asked the team here at Ignyta what they like (and don’t) about the company, their job, and people with whom they work. Our people said they loved that Ignyta maintains a “small company feel,” even as we grow and change, and that Ignyta’s strong commitment to excellence and the collaborative culture that supports it keep them wanting to do – and give – their best.

From the experienced leadership team that doesn’t take itself too seriously (come on, our clinical trials are named after a science fiction series…) to the vibrant, collaborative employee culture, Ignyta’s team members truly believe they’re working with the best to change cancer care on behalf of patients everywhere.

The Patrick M. O’Connor Beacon Program Ignyta co-founder Patrick O’Connor exemplified the Beacon value, and one of his interests was to help young people in their careers. In 2013, during Ignyta’s early days Patrick started an informal summer internship program, which has persisted and grown to this day. To commemorate this commitment to scientific internships, as first introduced to Ignyta by Patrick, and in honor of his distinguished life, dedication and service to patients and young scientists, Ignyta launched the Patrick M. O’Connor Beacon Program at Ignyta in July 2016:

As one of Ignyta’s founding scientific leaders in the field of precision medicine in oncology, Patrick M. O’Connor, Ph.D., believed that having young scientists work in Ignyta’s scientific labs would help them hone their scientific skills and enable them to choose a career path that best suits their scientific interests. Honoring this belief, Ignyta invites student interns every summer to join us in our pursuit of developing precision therapeutics and companion diagnostics that benefit cancer patients worldwide.

For more information on the Patrick M. O’Connor Beacon Program, contact hr@ignyta.com, and please read Ignyta CEO Jonathan Lim’s tribute, “A Shining Beacon: How My Cancer Researcher Friend Ignited My Resolve to Fight Cancer before He Died from Cancer.”

Information for InvestorsA New Dawn in the Fight Against Molecularly Driven Cancers
In the past, people referred to “curing cancer” as an unrealistic goal, a euphemism for things that couldn’t be conceived or achieved. But treating cancer becomes less mysterious every day, and today Ignyta is writing a new story, identifying the genomic causes of cancer and creating targeted cancer drugs that attack cancer at its source. Ignyta’s combination of precision therapeutics (Rx) and molecular diagnostics (Dx) creates a powerful “Rx/Dx” approach that excels at identifying and targeting hard-to-treat cancers in hard-to-find patients.
More than just a cancer drug company, Ignyta is a leader in biotechnology and precision medicine for cancer, working with healthcare providers to change the way we think about cancer, creating targeted therapies for genomically caused cancers, and putting powerful tools in the hands of those who need it most – ultimately bringing hope – and a new future – to patients with cancer.
 Ignyta is currently enrolling patients in clinical trials, including the STARTRK-2 trial of entrectinib. Learn more about Ignyta’s advantage in identifying and enrolling patients in clinical trials, as well as study eligibility, enrollment information, clinical trial locations, and more.

			Ignyta’s Story

Ignyta’s StoryIgnyta’s audacious goal is to eradicate residual disease in precisely defined patient populations by 2030.
Click through the yearly slides to read the story of Ignyta from our founding through today. And visit our offices in San Diego to see the Ignyta interactive timeline wall (also shown here) which includes our audacious future goals, all the way through 2030.
From our founding in 2011 as a molecular diagnostic company to our inexorable march towards achieving our bold vision for patients, this is Ignyta’s timeline – your story, our story…the story we’re writing every day.
 201120122013201420152011

2011 – Ignyta is founded to catalyze precision medicine for the benefit of patients

From our earliest days, we have focused on becoming the best precision medicine company in the world, using trailblazing science to fuel exceptional patient benefit, employee engagement, and shareholder value.
This is the image that sparked the launch of Ignyta. It shows a heat map of DNA methylation signatures found in fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) cell lines, showing that FLS from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) seems dissimilar from patients with osteoarthritis (OA), a finding that could be used for potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
Ignyta was founded by Jonathan Lim and Gary Firestein to explore the use of DNA methylation as a potential novel diagnostic tool for autoimmune disease.

2012

2012 – Ignyta’s foundational core values are set

From our earliest days, we have focused on becoming the best precision medicine company in the world, using trailblazing science to fuel exceptional patient benefit, employee engagement, and shareholder value.
On October 3, 2012, when the entire company could still fit comfortably in a small conference room, we conducted a “Values Jam” (original notes shown here) to define how we work to accomplish our goals. The resulting values (with the original values icons below) paint the picture of Ignyta’s unwavering commitment to patients and the values we abide by every day as we work tirelessly on their behalf. See the complete list and their explanations on the Ignyta Vision and Values page, and learn more about the people who live these values every day on our People, Culture, and Careers page.

The original Ignyta Values icons.

2013

2013 – Ignyta pursues an integrated Rx/Dx model

In May 2013, we added precision therapeutics (Rx) to our arsenal and became one of the only companies capable of end-to-end in-house identification, testing, and (eventually) treatment of molecularly driven cancers in certain hard-to-find populations.
In October 2013, we successfully in-licensed entrectinib – a Trk, ROS1, and ALK inhibitor from Nerviano Medical Sciences, and our Rx/Dx model was fully realized.
Today, Ignyta’s foundation remains a singular, unwavering focus on patients, enabled by an integrated Rx/Dx model that allows Ignyta to quickly locate and effectively target patients for whom Ignyta’s groundbreaking therapies can provide new hope.

2014

2014 – Ignyta presents landmark Trk inhibitor response at ASCO and achieves CLIA certification

To the left are the pre-treatment and Cycle 1 CT scans of a 75-year-old female patient with Trk fusion metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to multiple prior therapies, including FOLFOX, FOLFIRI/cetuximab, and irinotecan. Her partial response was the first-ever response in a patient with a Trk fusion cancer treated with a Trk inhibitor.

At ASCO 2014, Ignyta first presented evidence of Trk as a druggable target in oncology. In November of that year, Ignyta’s San Diego diagnostic laboratory passed the State of California survey for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification, granting Ignyta permission to offer molecular diagnostic services to patients. This represented a milestone for Ignyta’s integrated Rx/Dx approach to serving cancer patients.

2015

2015 – Ignyta puts entrectinib on the map at ASCO and launches STARTRK-2

At ASCO 2015, Ignyta presented Phase I clinical trial data for entrectinib, demonstrating that the drug candidate was well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. A recommended Phase 2 dose was determined, and a 91% response rate in patients’ meeting expected Phase 2 eligibility criteria was observed. Ignyta initiated the STARTRK-2 pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial of entrectinib in September 2015.
Pictured here are the CT scans of a 46-year-old male patient (“Mr. Z”) with NTRK1 fusion non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastatic to the brain that was refractory to carboplatin/pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, docetaxel, and vinorelbine. Mr. Z’s health rapidly deteriorated, and he was admitted to hospice care.
Mr. Z was subsequently enrolled in Ignyta’s STARTRK clinical trial of entrectinib, and the results were dramatic. Visit the Ignyta Patient Stories page to read Mr. Z’s amazing story, and the stories of other patients Ignyta has had the honor to treat in our clinical trials.
