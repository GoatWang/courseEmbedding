      Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2014-C24
    





September 30, 2016 03:14 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 19 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB), series 2014-C24 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates. A full list of rating actions follows at the 
      end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to the overall stable performance of the pool's 
      underlying collateral. The pool continues to perform as expected at 
      issuance. The pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 
      0.70% to $1.267 billion from $1.276 billion at issuance. There are no 
      specially serviced loans, and Fitch has not designated any loans as 
      Fitch Loans of Concern. There are two loans (0.73% of the current 
      balance) on the master servicer's watchlist due to deferred maintenance. 
      The transaction remains concentrated, as the top 10 loans represent 
      60.2% of the pool, and the top 20 represent 80.2%.
    

      The largest loan in the pool, the Mall of Victor Valley (9.1%), is 
      secured by a 574,723 square foot (477,384 sf of collateral) regional 
      mall located in Victorville, CA. The property was originally built in 
      1986 and renovated in 2013. The largest tenants include JCPenney, which 
      represents 19.2% of net rentable area (NRA) with a lease expiring in 
      September 2032, Sears (16.4% of NRA, expiry October 2019), and Cinemark 
      Theatre (13% of NRA, expiry November 2021). The property has maintained 
      high levels of occupancy and stable performance throughout its operating 
      history. As of the June 2016 rent roll, the property was 98% occupied. 
      The servicer-reported net operating income (NOI) debt service coverage 
      ratio (DSCR) of 2.57x as of year-end (YE) 2015.
    

      The next largest loan in the pool, the Grapevine Mills (9.1%), is 
      secured by a 1.625 million sf (1.337 million sf of collateral) regional 
      mall located in Grapevine, TX. The subject is located 10 miles north of 
      the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and contains a mix of 
      traditional mall tenants as well as outlet tenants. The tenants include 
      Burlington Coat Factory (7.5% of NRA, expiry January 2018), Neiman 
      Marcus (3.3% of NRA, expiry April 2018, and Bed Bath & Beyond (3% of 
      NRA, expiry January 2017). As of the March 2016 rent roll, total mall 
      occupancy was at 94%, with in-line occupancy of 89%. The 
      servicer-reported NOI DSCR was 3.25x as of YE 2015. The transaction 
      interests represent the A-3 and A-4 notes and are pari passu with A-1 
      and A-2 notes securitized in JPMBB 2014-C23 and A-5 and A-6 notes in 
      JPMBB 2014-C25.
    

      The third largest loan in the pool, the Columbus Square Portfolio 
      (7.6%), is secured by a portfolio of five retail/community facility 
      units and an underground parking garage, totaling 494,244 sf. The 
      collateral is located between 97th and 100th streets on Columbus and 
      Amsterdam avenues in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan. The 
      largest tenants include Quik Park (16.9% of NRA, expiry May 2029), Whole 
      Foods Market (12.6% of NRA, expiry September 2029), and Mandell School 
      (8.9% of NRA, expiry March 2030). Occupancy has dropped slightly at the 
      property year-over-year to 96% as of YE 2015 from 100% as of YE 2014. As 
      a result, NOI DSCR was reduced to 1.37x YE 2015 from 1.51x YE 2014. The 
      transaction interests represents the A-4 note and are pari passu with 
      the A-1 note included in WFRBS 2014-C22, the A-2 note included in JPMBB 
      2014-C23, and the A-3 note securitized in WFRBS 2014-C23.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks for all classes remain Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2014-C24 - MarketWatch

Investor Alert























press release


					Sept. 30, 2016, 3:14 p.m. EDT
				
Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2014-C24
























NEW YORK, Sep 30, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has affirmed 19 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB), series 2014-C24 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates. A full list of rating actions follows at the 
      end of this release.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








The affirmations are due to the overall stable performance of the pool's 
      underlying collateral. The pool continues to perform as expected at 
      issuance. The pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 
      0.70% to $1.267 billion from $1.276 billion at issuance. There are no 
      specially serviced loans, and Fitch has not designated any loans as 
      Fitch Loans of Concern. There are two loans (0.73% of the current 
      balance) on the master servicer's watchlist due to deferred maintenance. 
      The transaction remains concentrated, as the top 10 loans represent 
      60.2% of the pool, and the top 20 represent 80.2%.


                                        








The largest loan in the pool, the Mall of Victor Valley (9.1%), is 
      secured by a 574,723 square foot (477,384 sf of collateral) regional 
      mall located in Victorville, CA. The property was originally built in 
      1986 and renovated in 2013. The largest tenants include JCPenney, which 
      represents 19.2% of net rentable area (NRA) with a lease expiring in 
      September 2032, Sears (16.4% of NRA, expiry October 2019), and Cinemark 
      Theatre (13% of NRA, expiry November 2021). The property has maintained 
      high levels of occupancy and stable performance throughout its operating 
      history. As of the June 2016 rent roll, the property was 98% occupied. 
      The servicer-reported net operating income (NOI) debt service coverage 
      ratio (DSCR) of 2.57x as of year-end (YE) 2015.


                                        








The next largest loan in the pool, the Grapevine Mills (9.1%), is 
      secured by a 1.625 million sf (1.337 million sf of collateral) regional 
      mall located in Grapevine, TX. The subject is located 10 miles north of 
      the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and contains a mix of 
      traditional mall tenants as well as outlet tenants. The tenants include 
      Burlington Coat Factory (7.5% of NRA, expiry January 2018), Neiman 
      Marcus (3.3% of NRA, expiry April 2018, and Bed Bath & Beyond (3% of 
      NRA, expiry January 2017). As of the March 2016 rent roll, total mall 
      occupancy was at 94%, with in-line occupancy of 89%. The 
      servicer-reported NOI DSCR was 3.25x as of YE 2015. The transaction 
      interests represent the A-3 and A-4 notes and are pari passu with A-1 
      and A-2 notes securitized in JPMBB 2014-C23 and A-5 and A-6 notes in 
      JPMBB 2014-C25.


                                        








The third largest loan in the pool, the Columbus Square Portfolio 
      (7.6%), is secured by a portfolio of five retail/community facility 
      units and an underground parking garage, totaling 494,244 sf. The 
      collateral is located between 97th and 100th streets on Columbus and 
      Amsterdam avenues in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan. The 
      largest tenants include Quik Park (16.9% of NRA, expiry May 2029), Whole 
      Foods Market (12.6% of NRA, expiry September 2029), and Mandell School 
      (8.9% of NRA, expiry March 2030). Occupancy has dropped slightly at the 
      property year-over-year to 96% as of YE 2015 from 100% as of YE 2014. As 
      a result, NOI DSCR was reduced to 1.37x YE 2015 from 1.51x YE 2014. The 
      transaction interests represents the A-4 note and are pari passu with 
      the A-1 note included in WFRBS 2014-C22, the A-2 note included in JPMBB 
      2014-C23, and the A-3 note securitized in WFRBS 2014-C23.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








The Rating Outlooks for all classes remain Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.


                                        








Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:

Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

Why do we ask for Social Security?



Social Security Number


Why do we ask for your Social Security Number

Freddie Mac takes protecting your privacy seriously. We ask for your Social Security Number (SSN) to help us confirm that the requested information is being given to the mortgage holder or to someone authorized by the mortgage holder to receive the information.
We ask for your SSN because it allows us to quickly and accurately determine if your mortgage is held by Freddie Mac and to deliver an answer to you immediately. Providing a SSN increases the speed and accuracy of the look-up response.
We take measures to protect the SSN that you deliver to us (see below).

How do we handle your SSN after you enter it?

The SSN you enter within this form is only used to answer your specific look-up request. We do not save the number you enter or distribute it to a third party for any other purpose.
All information you enter in this form is transmitted from your web browser to our site via an encrypted communication channel. Please review our privacy policy for more details.

Do you have to provide your SSN number?

No. If you wish, you may submit an email request that does not require your SSN. Our customer service representatives will respond as quickly as they can, but given current demand it may take several days. Please be patient.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB), series 2014-C24 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are due to the overall stable performance of the pool's underlying collateral. The pool continues to perform as expected at issuance. The pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.70% to $1.267 billion from $1.276 billion at issuance. There are no specially serviced loans, and Fitch has not designated any loans as Fitch Loans of Concern. There are two loans (0.73% of the current balance) on the master servicer's watchlist due to deferred maintenance. The transaction remains concentrated, as the top 10 loans represent 60.2% of the pool, and the top 20 represent 80.2%.The largest loan in the pool, the Mall of Victor Valley (9.1%), is secured by a 574,723 square foot (477,384 sf of collateral) regional mall located in Victorville, CA. The property was originally built in 1986 and renovated in 2013. The largest tenants include JCPenney, which represents 19.2% of net rentable area (NRA) with a lease expiring in September 2032, Sears (16.4% of NRA, expiry October 2019), and Cinemark Theatre (13% of NRA, expiry November 2021). The property has maintained high levels of occupancy and stable performance throughout its operating history. As of the June 2016 rent roll, the property was 98% occupied. The servicer-reported net operating income (NOI) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 2.57x as of year-end (YE) 2015.The next largest loan in the pool, the Grapevine Mills (9.1%), is secured by a 1.625 million sf (1.337 million sf of collateral) regional mall located in Grapevine, TX. The subject is located 10 miles north of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and contains a mix of traditional mall tenants as well as outlet tenants. The tenants include Burlington Coat Factory (7.5% of NRA, expiry January 2018), Neiman Marcus (3.3% of NRA, expiry April 2018, and Bed Bath & Beyond (3% of NRA, expiry January 2017). As of the March 2016 rent roll, total mall occupancy was at 94%, with in-line occupancy of 89%. The servicer-reported NOI DSCR was 3.25x as of YE 2015. The transaction interests represent the A-3 and A-4 notes and are pari passu with A-1 and A-2 notes securitized in JPMBB 2014-C23 and A-5 and A-6 notes in JPMBB 2014-C25.The third largest loan in the pool, the Columbus Square Portfolio (7.6%), is secured by a portfolio of five retail/community facility units and an underground parking garage, totaling 494,244 sf. The collateral is located between 97th and 100th streets on Columbus and Amsterdam avenues in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan. The largest tenants include Quik Park (16.9% of NRA, expiry May 2029), Whole Foods Market (12.6% of NRA, expiry September 2029), and Mandell School (8.9% of NRA, expiry March 2030). Occupancy has dropped slightly at the property year-over-year to 96% as of YE 2015 from 100% as of YE 2014. As a result, NOI DSCR was reduced to 1.37x YE 2015 from 1.51x YE 2014. The transaction interests represents the A-4 note and are pari passu with the A-1 note included in WFRBS 2014-C22, the A-2 note included in JPMBB 2014-C23, and the A-3 note securitized in WFRBS 2014-C23.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks for all classes remain Stable. Due to the recent issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:--$27 million notes A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$184 million notes A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$41 million notes A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$190 million notes A-4A1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$75 million notes A-4A2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$297.3 million notes A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$66.6 million notes A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$76.2 million notes A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;Read More--$76.2 million notes B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$47.7 million notes C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$200.2 million notes EC at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$81 million notes D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$25.4 million notes E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$14.3 million notes F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;--$957.3 million* notes X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$76.2 million* notes X-B1 at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$81 million* notes X-B2 at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$25.4 million* notes X-C at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$14.3 million* notes X-D at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.Class A-S, B, and C certificates may be exchanged for class EC certificates and class EC certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, B, and C certificates.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
