You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.

Investment Philosophy

We use a COMMON-SENSE APPROACH to discovering INTRINSICALLY
 VALUABLE COMPANIES.

We believe that investors are best served by owning a portfolio of companies, both emerging and established, that have significant growth opportunities and competitive advantages that allow them to sustain their profitability while returning capital to shareholders over time. Rather than trying to guess which way the market or certain stocks may move in reaction to short-term news, we look to participate in the profitability of companies that will achieve superior long-term corporate performance.
We are business analysts, not stock market pundits. We spend our time learning as much as possible about the industry trends, competitive dynamics and customer demands that give rise to intrinsically valuable companies. Many investors, on the other hand, are nothing more than stock market speculators, analyzing the stock market instead of the actual companies in which they invest. While it is seductive to think that an investor can guess which way the market will turn, sustainable returns are generated through investing capital based on extensive analysis of the specific businesses in which you take a position.

We believe the best approach to investing in the stock market is based on identifying strong businesses, evaluating what these companies are worth and then buying the stock of these companies when they are priced at a discount to their intrinsic value. The attraction of this approach is based on the timeless nature of its applicability.
While we bring our own take on the best way to evaluate investment opportunities and construct portfolios, the core of our process is the same essential approach used by many of the truly great investors over the last century. We think this will be the approach used by many of the truly great investors over the next century as well. While various styles of investing come in and out of favor, buying great companies at compelling prices based on the amount of cash earnings they can return to shareholders over time, is a common-sense approach that has worked over the long-term. It is an easy to understand but difficult to execute task and one on which we focus all of our time and energy.
We are business analysts, not stock market speculators. We spend our time learning as much as possible about the industry trends, competitive dynamics and customer demands that give rise to intrinsically valuable companies. We put our clients’ capital to work based on extensive analysis of the specific businesses in which we invest.
Importantly, we think that all investments that create cash flow have an intrinsic value that is distinct from the price set by the market. Investments like artwork, gold and other commodities do not have this same type of intrinsic value. They are instead worth exactly what people are willing to pay for them. Investments such as bonds or stocks, which generate cash flows, are valuable even if there is no market in which to sell them.
While market prices frequently are a good approximation of an investment’s intrinsic value, the key to long-term performance is doing the deep research required to identify those instances in which market value deviates from intrinsic value. Identifying and exploiting these occasions of market mispricing is the focus of our investment management process.












Case Study

Ensemble can help manage your assets to
COUNTERBALANCE POSITIONS HELD ELSEWHERE.

Michael oversees a significant base of assets on behalf of his extended family. He makes asset allocation and long-term planning decisions himself and places his family’s capital with various investment managers that demonstrate superior results within their area of focus.
Michael hired Ensemble Capital to manage his allocation to U.S. equities. Ensemble’s approach to equity management allows our clients to participate across the typical value vs. growth categories and regardless of whether small, medium or large capitalization stocks offer the best investment opportunities. Michael’s interest is in achieving the strongest possible long-term investment returns while minimizing risk. Ensemble Capital’s approach of building a focused portfolio of superior companies trading at reasonable valuations was a good fit for Michael’s long-term approach to investing.

Unlike the large majority of separate account investment managers who offer only a small set of “model portfolios,” Ensemble built a custom portfolio for Michael. This meant that we were able to reduce his portfolio’s exposure to energy stocks to offset some significant energy holdings that Michael’s family held elsewhere. We also enabled Michael to harvest significant capital gains in his portfolio with us to match against losses realized in another portfolio.
Importantly, working with Ensemble for his U.S. equity allocation meant that Michael had direct access to the portfolio manager working on his account. Speaking with his various portfolio managers is an important aspect of how Michael gathers the information he needs to set his overall asset allocation and make investment decisions.
In addition to providing quarterly statements and performance reports, Ensemble meets with Michael regularly in person and by phone to discuss the portfolio and the general state of financial markets. We also provide on-demand reporting to the accounting firm that handles Michael’s complex financial holdings.
To protect the privacy of our clients, case studies appearing on this website are fictionalized but represent typical client engagements.












Stock Selection
ENSEMBLE PERFORMS DEEP, ORIGINAL RESEARCH
TO IDENTIFY COMPANIES WE BELIEVE WILL PRODUCE
STRONG RESULTS WITH LIMITED RISK.







Stock Selection  |  How We Pick Stocks

We CAREFULLY CONSTRUCT CUSTOMIZED PORTFOLIOS of these
companies on behalf of each client.

Original in-house research is at the heart of our investment process. We look for companies that have superior competitive positioning and create real cash earnings on behalf of shareholders at a higher than average rate. These companies achieve above-average returns on the capital they invest into their businesses while growing at sustainable and attractive levels.

return on invested capital
ability to grow

We understand that any potential investment is far more than a blip on a stock screen; it’s a business. And, ultimately, businesses exist to create value for their owners. To this end, we focus on finding attractive businesses that deliver real and sustainable shareholder value. We believe return on invested capital (ROIC) – that is, the realized cash return on each dollar invested in the business – is the key metric to determine the value-creating ability of any company. We focus on companies that generate high or improving ROIC, as those businesses, all else equal, deliver the greatest shareholder value.

We look first for durable companies that we believe have bright prospects and limit our investments to those that pass our rigorous tests. Only after this assessment positively identifies an investment opportunity do we work to establish what we believe is a reasonable estimate of the company’s intrinsic value. We then require the stocks we add to our portfolio to be trading at a substantial discount to our estimate of that intrinsic value.
We do extensive fundamental research to identify companies with these characteristics. The attributes we look for include strong and durable competitive advantages, high and sustainable returns on invested capital, competent and shareholder-oriented management, long-term growth opportunities, and sustainable levels of debt.
The focus of our investment process is in identifying the small number of companies that we believe have the ability to potentially produce a relatively predictable stream of cash flow generation. It is these companies that we believe we have the capacity to make a reasonable estimate of their intrinsic value and therefore identify those times when the market price of their stock offers a compelling investment opportunity.
While we believe we can identify these relatively rare companies, we also acknowledge that the large majority of companies have relatively unpredictable futures. We believe that most investors, including ourselves, are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the intrinsic value of the large majority of publicly traded companies or of the stock market as a whole (which of course is largely made up of these unpredictable companies). Our view on these other companies and on the market as a whole is not negative, but simply agnostic. Rather than seeking to pass judgement on all investment opportunities, we restrict our investments to those we think we can make an informed decision about and decline to hold an opinion about investments that do not pass this test.








Stock Selection  |  Expectations Matter
Even the most attractive business does not have unlimited value. Frequently, the market will have excessively optimistic or pessimistic expectations about a company’s prospects, which are often reflected in stock valuations. Our objective is to identify companies with outstanding profitability and growth characteristics, at times when the market does not fully appreciate them.
We always seek to pay a compelling price for the businesses in which we invest. A fundamental element of our research process is estimating what a potential investment is worth — that is, its intrinsic value. Alongside our company due diligence, we use several methods to derive that estimate. We consider traditional valuation metrics, but we also generate an informed estimate of the economic profits a company can deliver now and into the future. We only invest client capital in companies which trade at a meaningful discount to our intrinsic value estimate, taking great care not to assume that every great company is also a great investment opportunity.









Portfolio Management
INTELLIGENCE IS KNOWING.
WISDOM IS KNOWING WHAT TO DO.







Portfolio Management  |  How We Manage Portfolios

The portfolio management process is a critical aspect of RISK CONTROL.

We believe that there are two key elements of successful portfolio management that are not practiced by the majority of investors. While it is possible to be successful without abiding by these guidelines, not sticking with them makes superior performance much more difficult to achieve.







Portfolio Management  |  The True Cost of Diversification

Investment diversification has a SWEET SPOT. Too much can be
costly — and too little can be much worse.

Over the years, the financial services industry has broadly accepted and promoted the mistaken idea that more diversification is always better. Both academic and real world studies show that for a portfolio of stocks, the risk reduction benefits of additional diversification is minimal beyond 20 to 30 positions. In addition, the cost of diversification beyond this point outweighs the potential benefits — adding a 50th or 100th position to a portfolio requires adding an investor’s 50th or 100th best idea.
At Ensemble, we invest our clients’ equity assets in 20-25 stocks. This degree of focus provides the benefits of diversification while keeping our clients’ assets in our best ideas. With this level of focus, we are able to know every company in our portfolio inside and out.

Research shows that the benefits of diversification are optimized at between 15 and 30 holdings. Yet the vast majority of mutual funds hold hundreds of stocks or more. Owning hundreds of stocks makes mediocre performance the most likely outcome. Most great investors over the years have instead focused their portfolios in a mix of stocks that prevents any one investment going wrong from damaging long term results while retaining the ability to keep their clients’ assets in their best ideas.
In addition to diversifying within our clients’ stock portfolios, we work with each client to determine an appropriate level of lower volatility holdings – such as bonds and/or cash – to maintain overall portfolio volatility at a level that fits his or her financial situation and personal outlook.


PARETO'S DIVERSIFICATION 

Universe of public domestic stocks (NYSE and Nasdaq) 6,000
Universe of S&P 500 index 500
Typical actively managed equity mutual fund portfolio 200
Optimally diversified portfolio 25
 
Like the Pareto principle (the majority of the beneficial effect arises from the minority of the causes), Ensemble invests in highly-focused, customized client portfolios of 20 to 25 positions. Selected by our own proprietary research, we believe these positions offer the greatest potential for market performance, as supported by academic research, real-world studies, and our own firm's superior performance over the last 15 years. 






Portfolio Management  |  Investing vs. Trading

We focus on making MULTIYEAR INVESTMENTS in companies we
think will thrive over the LONG TERM.

Our analysis focuses on the positive and negative developments that are likely to play out over the next 3 to 5 years or longer. Because we seek to benefit from superior long-term corporate performance in excess of market expectations, our holding period is designed to match the multiyear period over which corporate performance unfolds.
Our clients care primarily about the long term performance of their assets and our investment analysis is focused on meeting those long term goals. The majority of investors instead focus myopically on the positive and negative developments that are likely to occur in just the next couple of quarters. This short term focus leads investors to pay high prices for what’s hot now or sell at low prices in the face of transitory difficulties.

Our average holding period for a stock is three or more years. The average holding time of a stock by the typical Wall Street firm on the other hand is just 11 months. Other investors’ short term focus plays to our advantage, allowing us to buy stocks that have fallen due to short term issues or sell stocks that have increased excessively in price based on passing good fortunes.
We believe investors are best served by seeking to benefit from long-term economic value creation at the companies in which they invest, while actively tracking their portfolio and buying or selling when market prices make such transactions attractive. Typically, this leads to longer holding periods. However, if our original assessment of a company’s prospects weakens or market prices increase dramatically in the short term, we will adjust our position as necessary.

11 monthsWall Street average holding time













Portfolio Management  |  Fixed Income

Over long time periods, we believe that stocks will deliver
SUPERIOR INVESTMENT RETURNS compared to bonds and cash.

The price of stocks' long-term outperformance is short-term volatility. Therefore, when clients have short- to medium-term needs for their assets or simply wish to avoid some of the volatility inherent in stocks, we add bonds and cash equivalents to their portfolios.
Rather than seek to take undue risk in this portion of client portfolios in search of slightly higher returns, we focus on building very high-quality portfolios of bonds that we believe fairly compensate investors in light of their reduced level of risk. Our primary concern in fixed income investing is credit risk — that is, the risk the bond issuer will not deliver on its obligation to make timely interest and principal payments. We focus on issuers’ financial health, analyzing their cash flows, leverage and liquidity – but also their operating histories and management strength. In this sense, our bond analysis is not that dissimilar from key elements of our stock analysis – and we perform this research regardless of whether the issuer is a corporation, municipality or other borrower.

Investing in bonds does not rest on credit analysis alone. We are particularly mindful of interest rate and inflation risks, as these factors will affect bond prices regardless of an issuer’s credit quality. As a result, these external forces can negatively impact those clients seeking reduced portfolio volatility or those who need to meet specific liabilities at given points in time. So while we cannot control or even predict the direction of broad market forces like interest rates or inflation, we do position our bond holdings to minimize those risks.
Ultimately, while bonds contribute to overall portfolio returns, we believe they should primarily be a source of stability and relative safety in client portfolios. In building our bond portfolios we seek to minimize risk and maximize peace of mind.

ENSEMBLE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
IS AN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM
WHOSE INTERESTS ALIGN WITH YOURS.















We offer CUSTOMIZED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT SERVICES,
FEE-ONLY OBJECTIVE ADVICE and UNPARALLELED CLIENT SERVICE.

Ensemble Capital Management builds focused investment portfolios to help you preserve your success and enhance your future.
Serving clients with assets ranging from about $2 million to over $95 million, Ensemble offers a high level of personalized service to individuals, families, trusts, foundations and nonprofits.









Investment Management

We believe that a LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE is an investment advantage.


We believe that exceptional investment returns are based on superior original research and the willingness to think independently rather than follow the crowd. Our investment philosophy is rooted in the idea that stocks and bonds represent a claim on future cash flow and are not simply trading vehicles. Our deep fundamental research is designed to identify outstanding companies, whose future prospects are not fully appreciated by the market. We build focused portfolios of these investment opportunities with the intent to hold them for multi- year periods so that we can participate in what we believe will be their superior corporate performance.
We build personalized portfolios for each client, matching investments to a client’s goals, objectives and tolerance for volatility. Unlike many financial advisory firms that invest their clients’ assets in mutual funds or an in-house model portfolio, we invest in individual stocks and bonds that we deem most attractive for each client.We charge a simple investment management fee based on a percentage of your assets under our management. This investment management fee is the only fee we charge and we accept no commissions or other payments from third parties.

FROM ASSETS TO OUTCOME














Services

Investment EXPERTISE AMPLIFIED by comprehensive service.

Built upon our deep investment experience, Ensemble Capital Management also offers a comprehensive and superior range of wealth management services and solutions to our clients to meet their unique financial needs.
Our team of dedicated specialists advances your objectives with a primary focus on efficiency. Our financial recommendations always integrate with your desired lifestyle to solve your financial goals. Our unparalleled client service, independent advice and experience make our recommendations simple and effective to implement.










OUR SERVICES INCLUDE

Comprehensive financial reporting and analysis
Charitable planning
Retirement analysis
Equity compensation and stock option analysis
Insurance analysis
Education planning
Analysis and review of estate tax strategies
Tax coordination
Coordination with client’s attorney and accountant
on trust and estate strategies

The Financial Advisor Landscape
The financial advisor landscape includes stock brokers, registered investment advisors, wealth managers, financial planners and many other financial professionals, all of whom play different roles and have different responsibilities to their clients.
Although many advisors use different terminology, in general advisors come in some version of the following:

Investment managers directly invest in a portfolio of stocks and bonds on behalf of their clients.
Asset allocators outsource investment management via mutual funds or other investment vehicles and concentrate instead on which managers to hire on behalf of their clients.
Fiduciary advisors have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of their clients and are paid to offer objective advice.

Non-fiduciary advisors are salespeople. Like all salespeople they are paid to sell a product or service and have no legal obligation to offer objective advice or act in the best interest of their clients.
Ensemble Capital is a fiduciary investment manager. We are paid to deliver objective advice.






OUR FEES COMPLETELY DEPEND ON THE VALUE OF YOUR
ACCOUNT — RISING WHEN YOUR ACCOUNT VALUE
INCREASES AND FALLING WHEN IT DECREASES.







Our INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED with yours —
to make your investments grow while MINIMIZING RISK.

Unless special circumstances exist, we do not outsource investment management services and the only fee you pay is ours. You do not typically pay a second layer of fees to mutual funds or other investment vehicles as do the clients of asset allocation-focused advisors.









Financial Planning  |  Long Term Planning

The PLANNING ADVICE you want, WHEN YOU WANT IT.

Whether you are working and building your portfolio, in retirement or overseeing a complex multigenerational asset base, Ensemble Capital can provide the advice you need. As registered investment advisors our work with clients goes far beyond picking stocks and bonds. When you hire Ensemble Capital, one of our portfolio managers will become your personal financial advisor assisting you in making complex financial decisions.






RETIREMENT PLANNING
If you are working and building your wealth, we’ll help you consider how much you will need to support your lifestyle after you retire and the tools available to help you get there.

INCOME PLANNING
If you are retired, we’ll work with you to understand how much spending your portfolio can support over the long term and advise you on the investment approach that is most likely to meet your goals.

MULTIGENERATIONAL WEALTH
Ensemble Capital is proud of the fact that many of our clients have two or three generations of family wealth under our management. If you are looking to put money into trust for your children or grandchildren or help fund their education, transfer assets to the next generation or otherwise coordinate multigenerational wealth management, we’ll work closely with you to make sure that this complex planning process is managed seamlessly.

ASSET ALLOCATION
After discussing your goals for your various portfolios, we’ll recommend an asset allocation that will best support your plans. Importantly, we’ll discuss the implications of various asset allocations so that you fully understand the basis for our recommendations.

STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK
If you have stock options or restricted stock, we will advise you on the best way to diversify your holdings or build a broader portfolio around these core concentrated positions.

MISCELLANEOUS
Our clients rely on us for a variety of financial advice. When we do not have expertise in the specific topic, we make it our job to locate the right person to help.








THE ENSEMBLE WEALTH MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Our 6-step wealth management process is based on the Financial Planning Practice Standards of the CFP® Board. Whether you are focused on a single issue or a more comprehensive and complex plan, we will help you achieve your financial goals:





Define Our Planning Relationship
This first step helps you understand the planning process and determine whether the focus will be 
									on one particular planning interest or creating a comprehensive plan.





Monitor the Plan and Your Progress
We will monitor your progress towards your 
									goals and help you take into account life events 
									that may change your initial situation or goals.


Refine Your Financial Goals and Gather Data
We discuss your goals and gather 
the data we needed to create your plan. We 
ask about your financial situation and any 
other relevant information.





Implement Recommendations
Once you decide which recommendations 
									you wish to implement, we can help guide 
									you through the implementation process and 
									coordinate with other professionals, such as 
									attorneys, accountants, or insurance agents.

Our PROCESS


Analyze Your Financial Situation
We will perform a comprehensive 
analysis to assess your current situation 
and determine what you must do to 
meet your goals.





Present Recommendations
Based on the analysis of your financial status, we 
									will develop and present concrete recommendations that 
									address your goals. We will walk you through our recommendations 
									and the implications of each particular alternative so you can make 
									an informed decision about your action plan.





Implement Recommendations
Once you decide which recommendations 
									you wish to implement, we can help guide 
									you through the implementation process and 
									coordinate with other professionals, such as 
									attorneys, accountants, or insurance agents.





Monitor the Plan and Your Progress
We will monitor your progress towards your 
									goals and help you take into account life events 
									that may change your initial situation or goals.




REFINE AND REPEAT












Portfolio Customization  |  Custom Built Portfolios

We are DEDICATED to producing the best RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS possible in a UNIQUE PORTFOLIO that reflects your SPECIFIC SITUATION.

Unlike many advisors who place clients in a “model portfolio” that reflect their generic investment needs – aggressive, conservative, income, etc – we custom build each portfolio from the bottom up to fit each client.
When building your portfolios we take into account both quantitative and qualitative aspects of your personal situation.
Most importantly, every trade we place on your behalf will be made with your particular situation in mind. Rather than trying to make you conform to a cookie-cutter investment model, we spend the time and energy needed to customize a portfolio built just for you.






TAX CONSEQUENCES
Before liquidating your existing portfolio, we examine your tax situation and the implications of any unrealized gains or losses you might have. If warranted, we will continue to hold certain legacy positions in order to defer gains or losses until a more opportune time.

LEGACY HOLDINGS
In addition to tax related motivations for holding legacy positions, occasionally a client will have a holding of special importance. In these cases, we are happy to hold the position on a permanent basis while keeping the client updated on the investment characteristics of the holding.

EMPLOYMENT IMPLICATIONS
Being located mid-way between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, it is not unusual for our clients to work for companies whose prospects are driven by many of the same inputs that drive financial markets. If desired, we can customize your portfolio to help diversify some of the risk embedded in the nature of your work.

INCOME NEEDS
In general, we attempt to maximize the total return, both income and capital appreciation, of our clients’ portfolios. However, if you require a certain level of current income, we will customize both your equity and fixed income holdings to meet this need.







Portfolio Customization  |  Client Service

CLOSE CONTACT with our clients is how Ensemble provides SUPERIOR FINANCIAL ADVICE.

When you first engage our services, we’ll have an in-depth conversation about your financial situation and set long-term objectives. But an initial meeting only sets initial goals. Over time, we’ll be in regular contact with you in person, by phone or by video conference.
We think the best financial advice is delivered within the context of a relationship built on trust. By keeping in close touch with you, we hope to build a more nuanced understanding of your financial life.
Truly comprehensive financial advice needs to be delivered in coordination with tax and legal advisors. To that end, we seek to establish strong working relationships with your other advisors and make sure that our advice to you is fully aligned with their expertise and advice.

Just as importantly, we want our clients to understand us and the investment decisions that we make on their behalf. We believe that investments are far more than blips on a stock screen and enjoy the opportunity to explain the individual investments we make to clients who are interested.
Unlike many firms who assign relationship managers to work with clients, our investment management team works directly with you. This means that when you have questions about specific investments in your account, your portfolio manager is able to discuss our thinking in depth. Discussing our investment analysis and the financial markets with clients is one of our favorite parts of our jobs.
In addition to regular conversations and meetings, our team is available at all times to answer any questions you may have or assist you in any way. From opening accounts to transferring money to obtaining financial information, we can be reached at any time and will provide you with what you need immediately.

CASE STUDY | FINANCIAL ADVISING
JOHN AND WENDY HAD RECENTLY RETIRED
 AND WANTED TO RETHINK THEIR LONG-TERM STRATEGY.

They came to Ensemble Capital looking for help to better understand their overall financial picture and to make sure that their investment strategy was aligned with their long-term goals.
The couple had a living trust, an IRA in John’s name and a large 401k with the employer from which Wendy had recently retired. Their two children are adults and their daughter was expecting her first child.
We sat down with John and Wendy in their home and spoke at length about their plans for the future. They discussed their desire to maintain a relatively modest lifestyle, while also being able to travel extensively. They were also interested in setting aside money to help pay for their soon-to-be-born grandchild’s education. Since they had recently retired, they were also contemplating becoming more involved in some of the nonprofits they had long supported and were interested in understanding how they could best provide financial support.

Having witnessed the financial crisis of 2008 and with memories of the Dot Com crash still vivid, John and Wendy were eager to figure out how they could maintain a stable, conservative portfolio while making sure that their asset base supported their spending now and for the rest of their lives.
After getting to know the couple, collecting details of their financial life and learning more about how they regarded money and the financial markets, we set out a plan that we felt would balance their various priorities. We then worked with John, Wendy, their CPA and lawyer to put the plan in place.
The 401k was rolled over into a newly created IRA to give Wendy maximum control over her investment options. We built out an asset allocation plan across the trust and two retirement accounts that reduced the impact of stock market volatility while also striving to make sure that their spending power would keep up with inflation over time and accounted for the fact that the couple did not currently need to take distributions from their IRAs, but would be required to soon.
Working with their lawyer, we helped establish a trust account for their grandchild that would be available to use for both K-12 schooling as well as college.
Finally we established a small donor advised fund to maximize the tax benefits of the John and Wendy’s charitable giving.
Over time, as John and Wendy’s lives evolve, their grandchildren grow up and their priorities change, we’ll stay in close touch with them, modifying their investment plan to keep it constantly aligned with their goals and objectives. While our advice is rooted deeply in financial analysis, it also recognizes that John and Wendy are unique individuals whose feelings about money and financial markets are a critical input into designing an investment plan that works for them.

Philanthropic Planning

About ONE-QUARTER OF ENSEMBLE ASSETS under
management are held in PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS, NONPROFIT ENDOWMENTS,
 CHARITABLE TRUSTS and other PHILANTHROPIC ACCOUNTS.

While our main efforts are concentrated on investment research and portfolio management, we also have developed special expertise in philanthropic planning.
Sean Stannard-Stockton, our president and chief investment officer, is well known in the philanthropic community for his popular Tactical Philanthropy blog that he authored from 2006 to 2011 as well as his regular columns in the Financial Times and Chronicle of Philanthropy. If you have an interest in maximizing the charitable impact and tax benefits of your giving, we can work with you to develop a philanthropic plan that meets your needs. We will then coordinate the creation of a private foundation, donor advised fund, charitable trust or other philanthropic account.

We work with both established philanthropic entities as well as help major donors design and implement philanthropic plans. If you are a major donor who wants to establish a philanthropic giving vehicle, we can help. For established foundations, we can provide a fresh perspective on your investment management needs.
We start by sitting down with you and reviewing your historical giving and goals for the future. Our first priority is to help you maximize your charitable impact. Once we’ve established what you want to accomplish, we will recommend a giving vehicle (or combination of tools) that meets you needs. We’ll also work with your accountant to design a plan that maximizes the tax benefits of your giving.
Whether you decide to set up a private foundation, donor advised fund, charitable trust or a combination, we’ll steer you through the process of implementation. While we do not offer legal or tax advice, we are very familiar with the tax and legal considerations of philanthropic planning and will work with you and your other advisors to put everything in place.
For new and existing foundations, charitable trusts and donor advised funds, we offer our investment management services with a specialized focus on the unique characteristics and goals of charitable accounts.
Our philanthropic planning services are available to all clients for no additional fee.













Private Foundations
Donor Advised Fund
Charitable Trusts













Private foundations are the MOST FLEXIBLE of
the various charitable vehicles.

They are a distinct legal entity that is controlled by your family. When you make a gift of appreciated stock into your foundation, you avoid paying capital gains taxes, take an income tax deduction for the full market value of the gifted stock, and permanently shield those assets from the estate tax.
Foundations are unique philanthropic entities that can engage in a variety of innovative charitable strategies. We help clients explore concepts such as loaning money to nonprofits, making grants to international organizations or otherwise leveraging the private foundation in ways not available to individual donors.

In addition to the tax and operational benefits of starting a foundation, there are important advantages for families who wish to engage in philanthropy together. Foundations are controlled by a board, frequently made up of family members. By providing a framework for coming together to talk about your most deeply held values and beliefs, private foundations facilitate making philanthropy part of your family tradition.
While there is no minimum donation required to launch a foundation, we generally feel that foundations should be considered by families who can make an initial donation of $1 million or more.





A donor advised fund is essentially a
“CHARITABLE CHECKING ACCOUNT.”

A donor advised fund allows you to avoid paying capital gains tax on asset transferred in, take an income tax deduction for the fair market value of those assets and then send charitable gifts to nonprofits at whatever time is right for you. Assets in a donor advised fund grow free of taxation, building your giving capacity.
A donor advised fund has the advantage of being incredibly simple and allows you to easily fund your philanthropy with assets you may not have considered in the past. In addition to stock or cash, you can deposit partial or whole interests in real estate, privately held businesses, and other non-publicly traded assets into a donor advised fund. In some cases, donor advised funds may offer larger tax deductions than private foundations to families who make large gifts in relation to their annual income.

Unlike a foundation, which is controlled by a board selected by the donor, a donor advised fund is an account held by a separate charity. A donor advised fund gives you the option to recommend grants to any public charity. All of the check writing and administration is handled on your behalf. By reducing the after tax cost of giving to charity and by streamlining the giving process, a donor advised fund can help maximize your enjoyment of philanthropy.
The nonprofits that offer donor advised funds require minimum donations of as little as $5,000. However, Ensemble Capital requires an initial donation of at least $250,000 for major donors who wish to engage our services.





Charitable remainder trusts (CRTs) pay income to an individual and, at a later date, pay the principal to a designated nonprofit.

CRTs are excellent vehicles for individuals who plan on leaving a portion of their estate to charity, but need to continue receiving income from their investment portfolios. Charitable lead trusts (CLTs) pay an annual amount to a designated nonprofit and transfer the principal back to the grantor or another person at some future date. These trusts can be structured to pull future tax deductions into the present or to significantly reduce gift and estate taxes on transfers of assets to heirs.
CRTs allow you to deposit highly appreciated assets (often common stock, real estate or privately-held business interests) and defer paying capital gains tax when they are sold. This allows you to tax efficiently exchange non-income producing assets for a diversified portfolio. You also receive an income tax deduction for the present value of your eventual gift to a nonprofit.

CRTs come in various forms with each having a different method of determining income payments. Ensemble consults with you to determine the best strategy to meet both current and future income needs by creating either a fixed income payment or an income stream that has the potential to grow over time.
CLTs give you two options to reduce your taxes. If your objective is an income tax deduction, a CLT can be structured so that annual payments are made to a nonprofit and the principal is returned to you at some point in the future. You can take an income tax deduction for the present value of the planned annual gifts in the year the trust is created. Alternatively, a CLT can name an heir as the beneficiary of the principal interest and be structured to enable a gift and estate tax deduction. If you forego an income tax deduction, you can use the present value of the annual payments to reduce the amount of the gift. In this way, you can make large transfers of assets to your heirs while minimizing the associated taxes.












CASE STUDY | PHILANTHROPIC PLANNING
LAURA HAS WORKED IN SILICON VALLEY FOR 15 YEARS AND IS TURNING
 HER INTEREST TOWARD HER PHILANTHROPIC IMPACT.

After working at a series of unsuccessful startups, she co-founded a company that eventually was acquired by a major consumer web company.
Now in her mid-40’s, Laura consults with new startups and has some significant investments in early stage companies. But her main interest these days is in her philanthropic work. She sits on the board of two nonprofits and has recently been learning more about how donors can achieve the most impact from their investments of time and money.
After spending time learning about Laura’s past work in technology and her current nonprofit work, Ensemble Capital proposed that she launch a private foundation. In addition, we suggested that she open a donor advised fund to receive a donation of her interest in a privately held business, which would receive more favorable tax treatment than if donated to her private foundation.

In addition to building a platform for her philanthropic giving and crafting an investment plan that would support her philanthropic interests, we also worked with Laura to build a philanthropic policy statement that laid out her focus areas and clarified what she sought to achieve.
While Laura uses her foundation and donor advised fund as vehicles to support her annual giving, we also helped her explore other creative ways that she could advance her philanthropic mission. Recognizing that donors can bring networks and expertise to the table as well as money, Laura’s foundation organized a summit for a number of organizations she supports to learn more about how nonprofits can effectively deploy social media. We also worked with Laura to have her foundation make a loan to a nonprofit and recently she’s been exploring the idea of having her foundation offer scholarships to students from her home town who want to work in engineering or other technology related fields.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
You are now leaving Ensemble Capital and will be redirected to the Ensemble Fund website.
CONTINUECancel

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund. You may obtain a prospectus on this website or by calling the transfer agent at 1-800-785-8165. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of the principal amount invested. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be successful in meeting its objectives. The Fund invests in common stocks which subjects investors to market risk. The Fund invests in small and mid-cap companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Fund invests in undervalued securities. Undervalued securities are, by definition, out of favor with investors, and there is no way to predict when, if ever, the securities may return to favor. The Fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. More information about these risks and other risks can be found in the Fund’s prospectus. The Fund is a non-diversified fund and therefore may be subject to greater volatility than a more diversified investment.
