More than $60 billion has flowed into U.S. debt ETFs this year, boosting assets to more than $520 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Retail and institutional investors are increasingly adopting these products as a cheaper, more liquid way to get exposure to the bond market. The funds can also be used in place of swaps and futures, or as an aid in transitioning portfolios from one asset class to another.




BlackRock also appointed derivatives expert Jim Hill as an adviser to its ETF business, Garville said. Hill, who’s worked at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG, also started Monday. He’ll support BlackRock’s attempt to increase the use of fixed-income ETFs by institutions, mostly working with the ETF capital markets and distribution teams.BlackRock has more than 80 debt-focused ETFs in the U.S. with a combined $263 billion in assets; the funds have absorbed about $30 billion since Dec. 31, Bloomberg data show.— With assistance by Shannon D Harrington
