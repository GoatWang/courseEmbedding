bebe stores, inc. Promotes Liyuan Woo to Chief Financial Officer | Business Wire
























































bebe stores, inc. Promotes Liyuan Woo to Chief Financial Officer






April 30, 2013 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BRISBANE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--bebe stores, inc. (NASDAQ: BEBE) today announced that it has promoted 
      Liyuan Woo to the position of Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). Ms. Woo, 
      who currently serves as the Company’s Principal Accounting Officer and 
      Vice President-Corporate Controller, has been with bebe stores since 
      2010. She will also retain the Principal Accounting Officer title and 
      will be responsible for global finance, accounting, treasury, tax, 
      compliance, planning and strategic corporate development. Ms. Woo will 
      report directly to bebe stores’ Chief Executive Officer, Steve Birkhold.
    


      As CFO, Ms. Woo will succeed Walter J. Parks, Chief Operating Officer 
      (“COO”) and Chief Financial Officer, who is departing the Company 
      effective May 3, 2013. The Chief Operating Officer position will be 
      eliminated and CEO Steve Birkhold will assume the COO responsibilities. 
      The Company said that the change in management responsibilities 
      reflected the desire for a flatter, more streamlined organizational 
      structure to quickly advance the vision for the future of the bebe brand.
    

      “We are pleased to be able to recognize Liyuan Woo’s talent, 
      accomplishments and strategic financial skills by promoting her to the 
      CFO role,” said Mr. Birkhold. “We are also grateful to Walter Parks for 
      his many contributions to bebe during the past ten years, and for his 
      assistance over the four months since I joined the Company in helping to 
      facilitate the transition and position bebe for a new level of success.”
    

      Prior to joining bebe, Ms. Woo held a Senior Manager position with the 
      accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, LLP in its Mergers and Acquisitions 
      Transaction Services Group. In that role, she advised private equity 
      firms and strategic buyers in a variety of industries on mergers and 
      acquisitions, capital structure analysis and recapitalizations, 
      leveraged buyouts, financial due diligence and transaction modeling.
    

      bebe stores, inc. is a global specialty retailer, which designs, 
      develops and produces a distinctive line of contemporary women’s apparel 
      and accessories under the bebe, BEBE SPORT, bbsp and 2b bebe brand 
      names. bebe currently operates 245 stores, of which 192 are bebe stores, 
      including the on-line store bebe.com, and 53 are 2b bebe stores, 
      including the on-line store 2bstores.com. These stores are located in 
      the United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Canada. bebe 
      also distributes and sells bebe branded product through its licensees in 
      approximately 24 countries.
    

      The statements in this news release, other than the historical financial 
      information, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated 
      results. Wherever used, the words “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” 
      “believe” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. 
      Any such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and 
      uncertainties and the company's future results of operations could 
      differ materially from historical results or current expectations. Some 
      of these risks include, without limitation, miscalculation of the demand 
      for our products, effective management of our growth, decline in 
      comparable store sales performance, ongoing competitive pressures in the 
      apparel industry, changes in the level of consumer spending or 
      preferences in apparel, loss of key personnel, difficulties in 
      manufacturing, disruption of supply, adverse economic conditions, and/or 
      other factors that may be described in the company's annual report on 
      Form 10-K and/or other filings with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially 
      impact revenues and profitability are difficult to predict.

Chief financial officer, Bebe 
How do you unwind: It’s funny that I used… more 










 


Education: B.A., accounting, Bentley University.
Proudest professional accomplishment: With the departure of the former-CEO and the board level turn over, my strong partnership with the new CEO and being a co-pilot with other executive members drove us to refocus the brand messaging to emphasize women’s empowerment, to fine-tune our strategic positions and messaging. I am proud to see the beginning of our turnaround!





Best mentor: Sharon McCollam, CFO at BestBuy, with whom I first connected when I became the CFO at bebe. Her war stories and golden nuggets of advice were invaluable, and I still draw wisdom from our conversations today.
How to help women in business advance: Mentoring, sponsoring and influencing other women and setting examples are important for leadership development. Share our own experiences, learned wisdom and war stories with other women. There are common mistakes and self-inflicted roadblocks to success we can refine and correct.
Dream super power: Time travel. One life is not enough to savor every moment, so second and third servings please!
Surprising fact about you: I spent a month in India to practice Ashtanga Yoga. The fact that I can sit still for a month seems to surprise people.

  "We are pleased to be able to recognize Liyuan Woo’s talent,        accomplishments and strategic financial skills by promoting her to the        CFO role" 



BRISBANE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--bebe stores, inc. (NASDAQ: BEBE) today announced that it has promoted        Liyuan Woo to the position of Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). Ms. Woo,        who currently serves as the Company’s Principal Accounting Officer and        Vice President-Corporate Controller, has been with bebe stores since        2010. She will also retain the Principal Accounting Officer title and        will be responsible for global finance, accounting, treasury, tax,        compliance, planning and strategic corporate development. Ms. Woo will        report directly to bebe stores’ Chief Executive Officer, Steve Birkhold.             As CFO, Ms. Woo will succeed Walter J. Parks, Chief Operating Officer        (“COO”) and Chief Financial Officer, who is departing the Company        effective May 3, 2013. The Chief Operating Officer position will be        eliminated and CEO Steve Birkhold will assume the COO responsibilities.        The Company said that the change in management responsibilities        reflected the desire for a flatter, more streamlined organizational        structure to quickly advance the vision for the future of the bebe brand.             “We are pleased to be able to recognize Liyuan Woo’s talent,        accomplishments and strategic financial skills by promoting her to the        CFO role,” said Mr. Birkhold. “We are also grateful to Walter Parks for        his many contributions to bebe during the past ten years, and for his        assistance over the four months since I joined the Company in helping to        facilitate the transition and position bebe for a new level of success.”             Prior to joining bebe, Ms. Woo held a Senior Manager position with the        accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, LLP in its Mergers and Acquisitions        Transaction Services Group. In that role, she advised private equity        firms and strategic buyers in a variety of industries on mergers and        acquisitions, capital structure analysis and recapitalizations,        leveraged buyouts, financial due diligence and transaction modeling.             bebe stores, inc. is a global specialty retailer, which designs,        develops and produces a distinctive line of contemporary women’s apparel        and accessories under the bebe, BEBE SPORT, bbsp and 2b bebe brand        names. bebe currently operates 245 stores, of which 192 are bebe stores,        including the on-line store bebe.com, and 53 are 2b bebe stores,        including the on-line store 2bstores.com. These stores are located in        the United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Canada. bebe        also distributes and sells bebe branded product through its licensees in        approximately 24 countries.             The statements in this news release, other than the historical financial        information, contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and        uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated        results. Wherever used, the words “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,”        “believe” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.        Any such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and        uncertainties and the company's future results of operations could        differ materially from historical results or current expectations. Some        of these risks include, without limitation, miscalculation of the demand        for our products, effective management of our growth, decline in        comparable store sales performance, ongoing competitive pressures in the        apparel industry, changes in the level of consumer spending or        preferences in apparel, loss of key personnel, difficulties in        manufacturing, disruption of supply, adverse economic conditions, and/or        other factors that may be described in the company's annual report on        Form 10-K and/or other filings with the Securities and Exchange        Commission. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially        impact revenues and profitability are difficult to predict.
