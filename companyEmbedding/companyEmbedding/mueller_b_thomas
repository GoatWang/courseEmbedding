Thomas Müller (German pronunciation: [ˈtʰoː.mas ˈmʏ.lɐ]; born 13 September 1989) is a German professional footballer who plays for Bayern Munich and the Germany national team. A very versatile player, Müller plays as a midfielder or forward, and has been deployed in a variety of attacking roles – as an attacking midfielder, second striker, centre forward and on either wing. He has been praised for his positioning, teamwork and stamina, work-rate, and has shown consistency in scoring and creating goals.[3]
A product of Bayern's youth system, he made his first-team breakthrough in the 2009–10 season after Louis van Gaal was appointed as the main coach; he played almost every game as the club won the league and cup double and reached the Champions League final. Müller scored 23 goals in the 2012–13 season as Bayern won a historic treble; the league title, cup and Champions League.
Müller earned a call-up to the German national team in 2010. At the 2010 World Cup he scored five goals in six appearances as Germany finished in third place. He was named the Best Young Player of the tournament and won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer, with five goals and three assists. At the 2014 World Cup he played a major role in helping the team win the trophy, scoring five goals and receiving the Silver Ball as the tounament's second top player and the Silver Boot as the second top goalscorer, and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI and in the Dream Team.
In 2014, Müller was ranked the fifth-best footballer in the world by The Guardian.[4]

Club career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Born in Weilheim, Müller played as a youth for TSV Pähl, and at the age of 10[5] he made the 50 km journey to join local Bundesliga side Bayern Munich in 2000.[2] He progressed through the youth system and was part of the team that finished runner-up in the Under 19 Bundesliga in 2007.[6] He made his debut for the reserve team in March 2008 when he replaced Stephan Fürstner in a Regionalliga match against SpVgg Unterhaching,[7] in which he scored. He made two more Regionalliga appearances in the 2007–08 season,[8] while continuing to play for the under-19 team. The following season, Bayern's second string qualified for the newly formed 3. Liga, and Müller established himself as a key player – he played in 32 out of 38 matches[9] and scored 15 times[10] to make him the league's fifth top scorer.[11] He also became involved in the first-team under then manager Jürgen Klinsmann; he appeared in pre-season friendlies,[12][13] and made his full debut on 15 August 2008, when he came on as a substitute for Miroslav Klose for the last ten minutes of a Bundesliga match against Hamburger SV.[14] Despite Müller feeling that his performance did not go well,[15] he made three more Bundesliga appearances that season[9] and made his Champions League debut on 10 March 2009 when he was substituted on in the 72nd minute for Bastian Schweinsteiger in a 7–1 win over Sporting CP. He scored Bayern's last goal as they won the tie 12–1 on aggregate.[16]
Bayern Munich[edit]
In February 2009, Müller signed his first contract for the senior team, a two-year deal effective from the 2009–10 season, along with reserve teammate Holger Badstuber.[17]
2009–10 season[edit]
See also: 2009–10 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller was prepared to be loaned or even transferred away to find first-team football,[15] but when Louis van Gaal was appointed manager, both players became fixtures in the Bayern first team from the start of the season.[18] In the first few matches, Müller was a regular substitute, and on 12 September 2009, he was brought on against Borussia Dortmund and scored two goals in a 5–1 victory.[19] Three days later, he scored another brace in a 3–0 Champions League victory over Maccabi Haifa.[20] He rounded off September by being named the Bundesliga Player of the Month[21] and earned praise from his namesake, legendary former Bayern and Germany striker Gerd Müller.[22] After the Haifa match, Müller was in the starting XI for almost every match,[23] only missing one match, a Champions League match against Bordeaux, for which he was suspended,[24] because he was sent off in an earlier match against the same team.[25]
In February 2010, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern Munich through 2013.[26] During the second half of the season, Müller continued to be a regular first-team starter,[18] usually playing in a central striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04,[27] and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career,[28] in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern.[29] The title was confirmed a week later with a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC,[30][31] a match which Müller started.
For the season, he played in all 34 Bundesliga matches,[32] starting 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists.[18] Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in the final of the DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double.[33] Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season.[34] Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milano at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. It was not to be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César.[35] Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat,[15] but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.[18]
In a poll conducted by the sports magazine kicker, he was voted by his fellow professionals as the best newcomer of the 2009–10 season[36] and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.[37] Müller credits Van Gaal for having had the biggest part to play in his rise to success – the coach arrived with a reputation for promoting youth team players, particularly at Ajax, and consistently gave Müller his chance in the first-team, going as far to say "Müller spielt bei mir immer" ("with me, Müller will always play").[38] Müller, in return, described Van Gaal as "a genius technician" who makes players "improve every time".[15]
2010–11 season[edit]

Müller with Bayern Munich in Saint Petersburg, Russia, May 2011


Müller returned from his post-World Cup break to sign another contract extension, this time extending his stay at Bayern until 2015.[39] As with all of Bayern's World Cup participants, he missed much of pre-season,[40] and his first match back was the Supercup against Schalke 04 on 7 August.[41] He was named in the starting 11, and scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win.[42] Two weeks later he scored the opening goal of Bayern's league season in a 2–1 home win against VfL Wolfsburg.[43] Müller played in every match of the first half of the season, usually as a starter,[44] but as the team struggled for results, Müller was unable to match the previous season's goalscoring exploits,[44] being dropped to the bench,[38] and even receiving a telling off from Louis van Gaal after missing an easy chance in a 2–0 defeat against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in August.[15][45] He was philosophical about this dip in form, though,[46] and after eight league games without a goal, he scored in a 4–1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt on 27 November;[47] He followed that by scoring in consecutive league and cup wins against VfB Stuttgart three weeks later.[48][49] These goals took his tally to eight goals in all competitions[44] and included a spectacular goal to open the scoring in a 2–0 Champions League victory against Roma on 15 September.[15][50]
As his team was on its winter break, Müller was left to reflect on what he described as "an almost unbelievable first year as a pro".[46] Müller began the second half of the season in good form, but was involved in an altercation with teammate Arjen Robben, who was angered when Müller showed his displeasure at a poor free-kick Robben took during a 3–1 win at Werder Bremen.[51] Müller again played in every game of the season[52] and scored 19 goals (12 in the league),[53] but the season was less successful for Bayern, as they finished third in the league,[54] and were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the semi-finals by Schalke 04[55] and in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League by Inter Milan; Bayern had won 1–0 at the San Siro, and Müller scored 31 minutes into the second leg to make it 3–1 on aggregate, but Inter levelled the score at 3–3 in the 88th minute to go through on the away goals rule.[56] Müller's mentor Van Gaal was increasingly criticised for inflexibility in tactical, transfer and selection policy,[57] and ultimately lost his job, being replaced with Jupp Heynckes.[58]
2011–12 season[edit]
See also: 2011–12 FC Bayern Munich season
In Bayern's first DFB-Pokal game Müller was awarded the man of the match after earning two penalties which were converted by Mario Gómez and Bastian Schweinsteiger, Müller then added a third in the closing stages to secure a 3–0 victory over Eintracht Braunschweig.[59] It took Müller five matches for him to get his first league goal; he scored it against Schalke 04 in Bayern's 2–0 win. Müller then scored in Bayern's next home game in the early stages of the match, which the went on to win, 3–0. On 26 November 2011, Müller netted the opener on the half-hour in Bayern's 6–0 thrashing of FC Ingolstadt, giving him his second DFB-Pokal goal.[60] Müller was on the short-list of this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or award.[61] On 10 and 15 January, in Bayern's warm up friendlies, Müller scored three goals in two games, a brace against the India national team (which Bayern then went on to win 4–0)[62] and one goal in Bayern's other 4–0 victory over Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[63] Müller provided two assists in Bayern's win over VfB Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 February, Bayern played 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Müller ended a goal drought lasting since 24 September 2011 with a header in their 2–0 victory.[64] On 31 March 2012, Müller played his 100th Bundesliga game against 1. FC Nürnberg.[65][66] On 19 May 2012, Müller scored the opening goal in the Champions League final against Chelsea with a powerful header. He was substituted shortly afterwards. Bayern Munich, however, lost the final on penalties. Müller stated how dissatisfied he was about the amount of time he had spent on the bench recently.[67] Müller said that although he was dissatisfied he wanted to stay at Bayern.[67] During the season, Müller scored seven goals in 34 league matches, two goals in five German Cup matches, and two goals in 14 Champions League matches.[68]

Bundesliga champions SpVgg Greuther Fürth in Bayern's 3–0 victory on 27 August 2012.[69] On 2 September, he netted a brace as Bayern thrashed southern rivals VfB Stuttgart, 6–1, in front of 71,000 at the newly expanded Allianz Arena.[70][71] Müller helped Bayern achieve a record-breaking start to the league season, when he netted a brace over newly promoted Fortuna Düsseldorf on 20 October in their 5–0 victory, recording Bayern's eighth successive win.[72] Three days later, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season, netting from the penalty spot, as Bayern defeated Lille 1–0 at the French side's newly built Grand Stade Lille Métropole.[73]
On 13 December, after his good run of form in the first half of the Bundesliga season, Müller pledged his allegiance claiming he was at home in Munich and that, "There is no club to step up from when you leave FC Bayern... there almost is no better club."[74] Six days later, he signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the Allianz Arena until 2017.[75] At the winter break in the Bundesliga, he had nine goals and seven assists in 16 league appearances and a further three goals in the Champions League;[74] this gave him a total of 13 goals halfway through the season, including his strike against Borussia Dortmund in Bayern's win in the 2012 DFL-Supercup. Müller scored his first goal in Bayern's second game back from the break in a 2–0 away win over VfB Stuttgart. Müller tapped in his fifth goal of the Champions League campaign on 2 April, completing a 2–0 first leg defeat of Juventus in the quarter-finals, ending the Italian club's 18-match unbeaten record in Europe.[76] On 23 April 2013, Müller scored two goals and gave one assist in 4–0 win against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final in the Allianz Arena.[77] On the return fixture, Müller scored a header as Bayern won 3–0 and gave Barcelona their biggest defeat ever in the Champions League, with a 7–0 aggregate score.[78] Müller then went on to play an important role in Bayern's 2–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the final. On 1 June, Müller scored a penalty in the final of the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal.[79] Bayern won the cup 3–2 to complete an historic treble. Müller scored 23 goals overall in the season (including all competitions), netting 13 in the Bundesliga,[80] one in the Pokal,[80] and an impressive eight in the Champions League,[80] he also added one in the 2012 DFL-Supercup which Bayern won 2–1.[81] This topped off Müller's highest scoring season to date.[82]

In Bayern's opening 2013–14 Bundesliga fixture, Müller missed a penalty for the first time. Seconds later, the save from the penalty flicked the hand of Álvaro Domínguez which resulted in another penalty which David Alaba converted. After this, Müller stated, "I am still happy to take penalties, but I think David Alaba is the main man for spot kicks for now." He played in the UEFA Super Cup.[84] On 25 September, against Hannover 96 in the second round of the DFB-Pokal, Müller scored twice taking his cup tally to five goals in just two games.

International career[edit]

Müller represented Germany at various youth levels, starting with the under-16s in 2004.[125] In August 2009, he was called up to the under-21 team for his debut in a 3–1 friendly defeat against Turkey.[126] He earned six caps for the under-21s and scored one goal,[127] the eighth in an 11–0 thrashing of San Marino.[128]
In October of the same year, Müller's regular appearances for Bayern's first team caused Germany national team manager Joachim Löw to publicly consider him for a call-up,[129][130] despite initial reluctance from the Bayern Munich board;[131] the following month, Müller was named in the squad for a friendly against the Ivory Coast.[132] However, this coincided with the death of national team goalkeeper Robert Enke, which led to the cancellation of a match against Chile the same week.[133] With less opportunity to try out new players, and with the under-21 team facing crucial qualifiers for the 2011 European Championship, Löw and under-21 manager Rainer Adrion felt that Müller was needed at the under-21 level, and Müller was called back into the under-21s.[134]
He was back in the senior squad for its next get-together, a training session in Sindelfingen in January 2010,[135] and was named in the squad for the following match, a friendly against Argentina in March.[136] He made his debut in this game in the starting XI at the Allianz Arena, his home stadium with Bayern. He was substituted in the 66th minute for fellow debutant Toni Kroos as Germany lost 1–0.[137]
2010 World Cup[edit]
Müller was named in Germany's provisional 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players.[138] Despite suffering a scare when he fell off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol,[139] Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players.[140] He was allocated the number 13,[141] normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack,[141] and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd.[141] He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[142] He started the first game of Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia,[143] winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process.[144] He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16.[145] In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal.[146] However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball[147] and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play.[15] He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals.[148] The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.[149]
With five goals Müller ended as joint top goalscorer of the tournament. He earned the Golden Boot with these goals and his three assists.[150] He also won the Best Young Player Award over fellow nominees André Ayew of Ghana and Giovani dos Santos of Mexico.[151] For both awards, he succeeded a German teammate, Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski, respectively, from 2006.[152]
In October 2010, he was named on the shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award along with four of his Germany teammates.[153] Reflecting on his World Cup success, Müller said "I basically got lucky, I hit form at just the right time".[46]
Euro 2012[edit]
Müller started all ten of Germany's qualifiers for Euro 2012, as the team qualified for the finals with a 100% record. Müller provided assists for seven goals,[154] three of which came in a 6–2 win over Austria in September 2011 which secured Germany's qualification for the finals with two games to spare.[155] He scored three times in the campaign, two goals coming in a 4–0 win over Kazakhstan in March 2011,[156] the third in a 3–1 win over Turkey in October of the same year.[157]
Müller was included in Joachim Löw's squad for Euro 2012, where the Germans were knocked out in the semi-finals by Italy.
2014 World Cup[edit]

Müller scored his first World Cup qualifying goals on 22 March 2013, scoring Germany's opener and final goal in a 3–0 away win over Kazakhstan.[158] He also scored in the 3–0 victories over Austria and the Faroe Islands to give him four goals in Germany's successful qualification campaign.
On 16 June 2014, in Germany's opening match of the 2014 World Cup,[159] Müller scored the first hat-trick of the tournament and was named man of the match in a 4–0 win against Portugal.[160] In addition, he was also the target of Pepe's headbutt in the 37th minute, which resulted in the Portuguese defender being sent off.[159][160] He denied that he had "overplayed" the situation leading to the red card.[161] On 26 June, Müller scored the only goal of the final group match against the United States to help the Germans win Group G and dispelled fear of collusion between German coach Joachim Löw and American coach Jürgen Klinsmann to play to a draw as had occurred in 1982.[162]
On 8 July, he scored Germany's opening goal in the 7–1 semi-final defeat of Brazil.[163] This goal was Germany's 2,000th goal in its history. Müller has now scored at least five goals in each of his first two World Cups, making him only the third player to do so (after Teófilo Cubillas and teammate Miroslav Klose).[164] With the goal, he has tied Helmut Rahn with 10 World Cup goals.[164]
On 11 July, Müller was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.[165] Having played a major role in the team's World Cup triumph, Müller received the Silver Boot as the tournament's second top goalscorer with five goals,[5] and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI.[166]
Euro 2016[edit]
Müller featured in nine of ten matches during Germany's qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2016, scoring nine goals as Germany topped their qualifying group to qualify for Euro 2016.[167]
Müller started in all six matches that Germany played at the Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy,[168] Müller's shot was the first one to be saved in the penalty shoot-out during the tournament.[168] This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup.[168] Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5.[168] Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.
Style of play[edit]
Müller's role can be described as an attacking all-rounder,[149] a player able to play in a variety of forward positions. As he came through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder,[15] but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more forward roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4-2-3-1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern,[169] and on the right for Germany.[170] He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.[171]
Müller has been praised for his maturity,[172] pace, technique,[173] awareness and positioning.[46] He has been particularly noted for his composure; Germany manager Joachim Löw said he is "impervious to pressure"[15] and former Bayern manager Louis van Gaal said he has tremendous mental strength.[46] A consistent scorer and creator of goals,[174] he describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one-on-ones.[15] Müller describes this role as Raumdeuter,[175] a term that translates to "interpreter of space" (cf. Raumdeuter, "space interpreter"). During 2014 World Cup, Germany manager Joachim Löw stated that Müller "is a very unorthodox player and you can't really predict his lines of running, but he has one aim and that is 'how can I score a goal?".[176]
Personal life[edit]
Müller was born in Weilheim, Upper Bavaria, and grew up in the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media attention during his World Cup exploits.[177] His parents are Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, Simon, who is two and a half years younger.[177] He married his long-time girlfriend Lisa Trede, a semi-professional equestrian who works on a farm,[178] in December 2009 after being engaged for two years.[179] In June 2011, he became an ambassador for YoungWings, a charity that helps children who have suffered bereavement or trauma.[180]

Thomas Müller (German pronunciation: [ˈtʰoː.mas ˈmʏ.lɐ]; born 13 September 1989) is a German professional footballer who plays for Bayern Munich and the Germany national team. A very versatile player, Müller plays as a midfielder or forward, and has been deployed in a variety of attacking roles – as an attacking midfielder, second striker, centre forward and on either wing. He has been praised for his positioning, teamwork and stamina, work-rate, and has shown consistency in scoring and creating goals.[3]
A product of Bayern's youth system, he made his first-team breakthrough in the 2009–10 season after Louis van Gaal was appointed as the main coach; he played almost every game as the club won the league and cup double and reached the Champions League final. Müller scored 23 goals in the 2012–13 season as Bayern won a historic treble; the league title, cup and Champions League.
Müller earned a call-up to the German national team in 2010. At the 2010 World Cup he scored five goals in six appearances as Germany finished in third place. He was named the Best Young Player of the tournament and won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer, with five goals and three assists. At the 2014 World Cup he played a major role in helping the team win the trophy, scoring five goals and receiving the Silver Ball as the tounament's second top player and the Silver Boot as the second top goalscorer, and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI and in the Dream Team.
In 2014, Müller was ranked the fifth-best footballer in the world by The Guardian.[4]

Club career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Born in Weilheim, Müller played as a youth for TSV Pähl, and at the age of 10[5] he made the 50 km journey to join local Bundesliga side Bayern Munich in 2000.[2] He progressed through the youth system and was part of the team that finished runner-up in the Under 19 Bundesliga in 2007.[6] He made his debut for the reserve team in March 2008 when he replaced Stephan Fürstner in a Regionalliga match against SpVgg Unterhaching,[7] in which he scored. He made two more Regionalliga appearances in the 2007–08 season,[8] while continuing to play for the under-19 team. The following season, Bayern's second string qualified for the newly formed 3. Liga, and Müller established himself as a key player – he played in 32 out of 38 matches[9] and scored 15 times[10] to make him the league's fifth top scorer.[11] He also became involved in the first-team under then manager Jürgen Klinsmann; he appeared in pre-season friendlies,[12][13] and made his full debut on 15 August 2008, when he came on as a substitute for Miroslav Klose for the last ten minutes of a Bundesliga match against Hamburger SV.[14] Despite Müller feeling that his performance did not go well,[15] he made three more Bundesliga appearances that season[9] and made his Champions League debut on 10 March 2009 when he was substituted on in the 72nd minute for Bastian Schweinsteiger in a 7–1 win over Sporting CP. He scored Bayern's last goal as they won the tie 12–1 on aggregate.[16]
Bayern Munich[edit]
In February 2009, Müller signed his first contract for the senior team, a two-year deal effective from the 2009–10 season, along with reserve teammate Holger Badstuber.[17]
2009–10 season[edit]
See also: 2009–10 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller was prepared to be loaned or even transferred away to find first-team football,[15] but when Louis van Gaal was appointed manager, both players became fixtures in the Bayern first team from the start of the season.[18] In the first few matches, Müller was a regular substitute, and on 12 September 2009, he was brought on against Borussia Dortmund and scored two goals in a 5–1 victory.[19] Three days later, he scored another brace in a 3–0 Champions League victory over Maccabi Haifa.[20] He rounded off September by being named the Bundesliga Player of the Month[21] and earned praise from his namesake, legendary former Bayern and Germany striker Gerd Müller.[22] After the Haifa match, Müller was in the starting XI for almost every match,[23] only missing one match, a Champions League match against Bordeaux, for which he was suspended,[24] because he was sent off in an earlier match against the same team.[25]
In February 2010, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern Munich through 2013.[26] During the second half of the season, Müller continued to be a regular first-team starter,[18] usually playing in a central striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04,[27] and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career,[28] in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern.[29] The title was confirmed a week later with a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC,[30][31] a match which Müller started.
For the season, he played in all 34 Bundesliga matches,[32] starting 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists.[18] Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in the final of the DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double.[33] Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season.[34] Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milano at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. It was not to be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César.[35] Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat,[15] but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.[18]
In a poll conducted by the sports magazine kicker, he was voted by his fellow professionals as the best newcomer of the 2009–10 season[36] and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.[37] Müller credits Van Gaal for having had the biggest part to play in his rise to success – the coach arrived with a reputation for promoting youth team players, particularly at Ajax, and consistently gave Müller his chance in the first-team, going as far to say "Müller spielt bei mir immer" ("with me, Müller will always play").[38] Müller, in return, described Van Gaal as "a genius technician" who makes players "improve every time".[15]
2010–11 season[edit]

Müller returned from his post-World Cup break to sign another contract extension, this time extending his stay at Bayern until 2015.[39] As with all of Bayern's World Cup participants, he missed much of pre-season,[40] and his first match back was the Supercup against Schalke 04 on 7 August.[41] He was named in the starting 11, and scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win.[42] Two weeks later he scored the opening goal of Bayern's league season in a 2–1 home win against VfL Wolfsburg.[43] Müller played in every match of the first half of the season, usually as a starter,[44] but as the team struggled for results, Müller was unable to match the previous season's goalscoring exploits,[44] being dropped to the bench,[38] and even receiving a telling off from Louis van Gaal after missing an easy chance in a 2–0 defeat against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in August.[15][45] He was philosophical about this dip in form, though,[46] and after eight league games without a goal, he scored in a 4–1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt on 27 November;[47] He followed that by scoring in consecutive league and cup wins against VfB Stuttgart three weeks later.[48][49] These goals took his tally to eight goals in all competitions[44] and included a spectacular goal to open the scoring in a 2–0 Champions League victory against Roma on 15 September.[15][50]
As his team was on its winter break, Müller was left to reflect on what he described as "an almost unbelievable first year as a pro".[46] Müller began the second half of the season in good form, but was involved in an altercation with teammate Arjen Robben, who was angered when Müller showed his displeasure at a poor free-kick Robben took during a 3–1 win at Werder Bremen.[51] Müller again played in every game of the season[52] and scored 19 goals (12 in the league),[53] but the season was less successful for Bayern, as they finished third in the league,[54] and were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the semi-finals by Schalke 04[55] and in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League by Inter Milan; Bayern had won 1–0 at the San Siro, and Müller scored 31 minutes into the second leg to make it 3–1 on aggregate, but Inter levelled the score at 3–3 in the 88th minute to go through on the away goals rule.[56] Müller's mentor Van Gaal was increasingly criticised for inflexibility in tactical, transfer and selection policy,[57] and ultimately lost his job, being replaced with Jupp Heynckes.[58]
2011–12 season[edit]
See also: 2011–12 FC Bayern Munich season
In Bayern's first DFB-Pokal game Müller was awarded the man of the match after earning two penalties which were converted by Mario Gómez and Bastian Schweinsteiger, Müller then added a third in the closing stages to secure a 3–0 victory over Eintracht Braunschweig.[59] It took Müller five matches for him to get his first league goal; he scored it against Schalke 04 in Bayern's 2–0 win. Müller then scored in Bayern's next home game in the early stages of the match, which the went on to win, 3–0. On 26 November 2011, Müller netted the opener on the half-hour in Bayern's 6–0 thrashing of FC Ingolstadt, giving him his second DFB-Pokal goal.[60] Müller was on the short-list of this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or award.[61] On 10 and 15 January, in Bayern's warm up friendlies, Müller scored three goals in two games, a brace against the India national team (which Bayern then went on to win 4–0)[62] and one goal in Bayern's other 4–0 victory over Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[63] Müller provided two assists in Bayern's win over VfB Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 February, Bayern played 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Müller ended a goal drought lasting since 24 September 2011 with a header in their 2–0 victory.[64] On 31 March 2012, Müller played his 100th Bundesliga game against 1. FC Nürnberg.[65][66] On 19 May 2012, Müller scored the opening goal in the Champions League final against Chelsea with a powerful header. He was substituted shortly afterwards. Bayern Munich, however, lost the final on penalties. Müller stated how dissatisfied he was about the amount of time he had spent on the bench recently.[67] Müller said that although he was dissatisfied he wanted to stay at Bayern.[67] During the season, Müller scored seven goals in 34 league matches, two goals in five German Cup matches, and two goals in 14 Champions League matches.[68]
2012–13 season[edit]
See also: 2012–13 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller's first Bundesliga goal of the season came over 2. Bundesliga champions SpVgg Greuther Fürth in Bayern's 3–0 victory on 27 August 2012.[69] On 2 September, he netted a brace as Bayern thrashed southern rivals VfB Stuttgart, 6–1, in front of 71,000 at the newly expanded Allianz Arena.[70][71] Müller helped Bayern achieve a record-breaking start to the league season, when he netted a brace over newly promoted Fortuna Düsseldorf on 20 October in their 5–0 victory, recording Bayern's eighth successive win.[72] Three days later, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season, netting from the penalty spot, as Bayern defeated Lille 1–0 at the French side's newly built Grand Stade Lille Métropole.[73]
On 13 December, after his good run of form in the first half of the Bundesliga season, Müller pledged his allegiance claiming he was at home in Munich and that, "There is no club to step up from when you leave FC Bayern... there almost is no better club."[74] Six days later, he signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the Allianz Arena until 2017.[75] At the winter break in the Bundesliga, he had nine goals and seven assists in 16 league appearances and a further three goals in the Champions League;[74] this gave him a total of 13 goals halfway through the season, including his strike against Borussia Dortmund in Bayern's win in the 2012 DFL-Supercup. Müller scored his first goal in Bayern's second game back from the break in a 2–0 away win over VfB Stuttgart. Müller tapped in his fifth goal of the Champions League campaign on 2 April, completing a 2–0 first leg defeat of Juventus in the quarter-finals, ending the Italian club's 18-match unbeaten record in Europe.[76] On 23 April 2013, Müller scored two goals and gave one assist in 4–0 win against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final in the Allianz Arena.[77] On the return fixture, Müller scored a header as Bayern won 3–0 and gave Barcelona their biggest defeat ever in the Champions League, with a 7–0 aggregate score.[78] Müller then went on to play an important role in Bayern's 2–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the final. On 1 June, Müller scored a penalty in the final of the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal.[79] Bayern won the cup 3–2 to complete an historic treble. Müller scored 23 goals overall in the season (including all competitions), netting 13 in the Bundesliga,[80] one in the Pokal,[80] and an impressive eight in the Champions League,[80] he also added one in the 2012 DFL-Supercup which Bayern won 2–1.[81] This topped off Müller's highest scoring season to date.[82]

Müller began the 2013–14 season by playing in the German Super Cup. by scoring in seven of Bayern's 12 pre-season games. His first competitive match came against Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup.[83] On 5 August, Müller scored a hat-trick as Bayern won 5–0 in the team's 2013–14 DFB-Pokal first-round game against Schwarz-Weiß Rehden. In Bayern's opening 2013–14 Bundesliga fixture, Müller missed a penalty for the first time. Seconds later, the save from the penalty flicked the hand of Álvaro Domínguez which resulted in another penalty which David Alaba converted. After this, Müller stated, "I am still happy to take penalties, but I think David Alaba is the main man for spot kicks for now." He played in the UEFA Super Cup.[84] On 25 September, against Hannover 96 in the second round of the DFB-Pokal, Müller scored twice taking his cup tally to five goals in just two games. On 28 September, Müller scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over VfL Wolfsburg, giving him his first goal in the 2013–14 Bundesliga. Müller scored his first 2013–14 UEFA Champions League goal of the campaign and Bayern defeated Manchester City 3–1 at the City of Manchester Stadium on 2 October. He played in a match at the FIFA Club World Cup.[85]
On 17 May 2014, Müller scored Bayern's second goal in a 2–0 extra-time defeat of Borussia Dortmund in the 2014 DFB-Pokal Final, giving die Roten the tenth league and cup double in their history.[86] Müller finished as the tournament's top scorer with eight goals in five appearances.[87] He finished the season by scoring 13 goals in 31 league matches, eight goals in five DFB-Pokal matches, and five goals in 12 Champions League matches.[88]

On 9 December 2015, Müller came on as a 46th-minute substitute for Franck Ribéry in a 2–0 win against Dinamo Zagreb.[113] He failed to convert his penalty shot in the match[114] and finished the group stage with five goals from six appearances.[105] On 18 December 2015, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern, keeping him at the club until 2021.[115] On 19 December 2015,[116] Bayern defeated Hannover 96 1–0[116] with a goal from the penalty mark from Müller.[117] Bayern went on winter break after the match.[117] Müller finished the first half of the league with 14 goals from 17 appearances.[105] This includes scoring five goals from the penalty mark in six opportunities.[105] He had scored 21 goals in 25 appearances in all competitions up until the winter break.[100][105]

International career[edit]

Müller represented Germany at various youth levels, starting with the under-16s in 2004.[125] In August 2009, he was called up to the under-21 team for his debut in a 3–1 friendly defeat against Turkey.[126] He earned six caps for the under-21s and scored one goal,[127] the eighth in an 11–0 thrashing of San Marino.[128]
In October of the same year, Müller's regular appearances for Bayern's first team caused Germany national team manager Joachim Löw to publicly consider him for a call-up,[129][130] despite initial reluctance from the Bayern Munich board;[131] the following month, Müller was named in the squad for a friendly against the Ivory Coast.[132] However, this coincided with the death of national team goalkeeper Robert Enke, which led to the cancellation of a match against Chile the same week.[133] With less opportunity to try out new players, and with the under-21 team facing crucial qualifiers for the 2011 European Championship, Löw and under-21 manager Rainer Adrion felt that Müller was needed at the under-21 level, and Müller was called back into the under-21s.[134]
He was back in the senior squad for its next get-together, a training session in Sindelfingen in January 2010,[135] and was named in the squad for the following match, a friendly against Argentina in March.[136] He made his debut in this game in the starting XI at the Allianz Arena, his home stadium with Bayern. He was substituted in the 66th minute for fellow debutant Toni Kroos as Germany lost 1–0.[137]
2010 World Cup[edit]
Müller was named in Germany's provisional 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players.[138] Despite suffering a scare when he fell off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol,[139] Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players.[140] He was allocated the number 13,[141] normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack,[141] and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd.[141] He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[142] He started the first game of Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia,[143] winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process.[144] He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16.[145] In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal.[146] However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball[147] and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play.[15] He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals.[148] The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.[149]
With five goals Müller ended as joint top goalscorer of the tournament. He earned the Golden Boot with these goals and his three assists.[150] He also won the Best Young Player Award over fellow nominees André Ayew of Ghana and Giovani dos Santos of Mexico.[151] For both awards, he succeeded a German teammate, Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski, respectively, from 2006.[152]
In October 2010, he was named on the shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award along with four of his Germany teammates.[153] Reflecting on his World Cup success, Müller said "I basically got lucky, I hit form at just the right time".[46]
Euro 2012[edit]
Müller started all ten of Germany's qualifiers for Euro 2012, as the team qualified for the finals with a 100% record. Müller provided assists for seven goals,[154] three of which came in a 6–2 win over Austria in September 2011 which secured Germany's qualification for the finals with two games to spare.[155] He scored three times in the campaign, two goals coming in a 4–0 win over Kazakhstan in March 2011,[156] the third in a 3–1 win over Turkey in October of the same year.[157]
Müller was included in Joachim Löw's squad for Euro 2012, where the Germans were knocked out in the semi-finals by Italy.
2014 World Cup[edit]

Müller scored his first World Cup qualifying goals on 22 March 2013, scoring Germany's opener and final goal in a 3–0 away win over Kazakhstan.[158] He also scored in the 3–0 victories over Austria and the Faroe Islands to give him four goals in Germany's successful qualification campaign.
On 16 June 2014, in Germany's opening match of the 2014 World Cup,[159] Müller scored the first hat-trick of the tournament and was named man of the match in a 4–0 win against Portugal.[160] In addition, he was also the target of Pepe's headbutt in the 37th minute, which resulted in the Portuguese defender being sent off.[159][160] He denied that he had "overplayed" the situation leading to the red card.[161] On 26 June, Müller scored the only goal of the final group match against the United States to help the Germans win Group G and dispelled fear of collusion between German coach Joachim Löw and American coach Jürgen Klinsmann to play to a draw as had occurred in 1982.[162]
On 8 July, he scored Germany's opening goal in the 7–1 semi-final defeat of Brazil.[163] This goal was Germany's 2,000th goal in its history. Müller has now scored at least five goals in each of his first two World Cups, making him only the third player to do so (after Teófilo Cubillas and teammate Miroslav Klose).[164] With the goal, he has tied Helmut Rahn with 10 World Cup goals.[164]
On 11 July, Müller was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.[165] Having played a major role in the team's World Cup triumph, Müller received the Silver Boot as the tournament's second top goalscorer with five goals,[5] and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI.[166]
Euro 2016[edit]
Müller featured in nine of ten matches during Germany's qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2016, scoring nine goals as Germany topped their qualifying group to qualify for Euro 2016.[167]
Müller started in all six matches that Germany played at the Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy,[168] Müller's shot was the first one to be saved in the penalty shoot-out during the tournament.[168] This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup.[168] Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5.[168] Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.
Style of play[edit]
Müller's role can be described as an attacking all-rounder,[149] a player able to play in a variety of forward positions. As he came through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder,[15] but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more forward roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4-2-3-1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern,[169] and on the right for Germany.[170] He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.[171]
Müller has been praised for his maturity,[172] pace, technique,[173] awareness and positioning.[46] He has been particularly noted for his composure; Germany manager Joachim Löw said he is "impervious to pressure"[15] and former Bayern manager Louis van Gaal said he has tremendous mental strength.[46] A consistent scorer and creator of goals,[174] he describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one-on-ones.[15] Müller describes this role as Raumdeuter,[175] a term that translates to "interpreter of space" (cf. Raumdeuter, "space interpreter"). During 2014 World Cup, Germany manager Joachim Löw stated that Müller "is a very unorthodox player and you can't really predict his lines of running, but he has one aim and that is 'how can I score a goal?".[176]
Personal life[edit]
Müller was born in Weilheim, Upper Bavaria, and grew up in the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media attention during his World Cup exploits.[177] His parents are Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, Simon, who is two and a half years younger.[177] He married his long-time girlfriend Lisa Trede, a semi-professional equestrian who works on a farm,[178] in December 2009 after being engaged for two years.[179] In June 2011, he became an ambassador for YoungWings, a charity that helps children who have suffered bereavement or trauma.[180]

Thomas Müller (German pronunciation: [ˈtʰoː.mas ˈmʏ.lɐ]; born 13 September 1989) is a German professional footballer who plays for Bayern Munich and the Germany national team. A very versatile player, Müller plays as a midfielder or forward, and has been deployed in a variety of attacking roles – as an attacking midfielder, second striker, centre forward and on either wing. He has been praised for his positioning, teamwork and stamina, work-rate, and has shown consistency in scoring and creating goals.[3]
A product of Bayern's youth system, he made his first-team breakthrough in the 2009–10 season after Louis van Gaal was appointed as the main coach; he played almost every game as the club won the league and cup double and reached the Champions League final. Müller scored 23 goals in the 2012–13 season as Bayern won a historic treble; the league title, cup and Champions League.
Müller earned a call-up to the German national team in 2010. At the 2010 World Cup he scored five goals in six appearances as Germany finished in third place. He was named the Best Young Player of the tournament and won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer, with five goals and three assists. At the 2014 World Cup he played a major role in helping the team win the trophy, scoring five goals and receiving the Silver Ball as the tounament's second top player and the Silver Boot as the second top goalscorer, and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI and in the Dream Team.
In 2014, Müller was ranked the fifth-best footballer in the world by The Guardian.[4]

Club career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Born in Weilheim, Müller played as a youth for TSV Pähl, and at the age of 10[5] he made the 50 km journey to join local Bundesliga side Bayern Munich in 2000.[2] He progressed through the youth system and was part of the team that finished runner-up in the Under 19 Bundesliga in 2007.[6] He made his debut for the reserve team in March 2008 when he replaced Stephan Fürstner in a Regionalliga match against SpVgg Unterhaching,[7] in which he scored. He made two more Regionalliga appearances in the 2007–08 season,[8] while continuing to play for the under-19 team. The following season, Bayern's second string qualified for the newly formed 3. Liga, and Müller established himself as a key player – he played in 32 out of 38 matches[9] and scored 15 times[10] to make him the league's fifth top scorer.[11] He also became involved in the first-team under then manager Jürgen Klinsmann; he appeared in pre-season friendlies,[12][13] and made his full debut on 15 August 2008, when he came on as a substitute for Miroslav Klose for the last ten minutes of a Bundesliga match against Hamburger SV.[14] Despite Müller feeling that his performance did not go well,[15] he made three more Bundesliga appearances that season[9] and made his Champions League debut on 10 March 2009 when he was substituted on in the 72nd minute for Bastian Schweinsteiger in a 7–1 win over Sporting CP. He scored Bayern's last goal as they won the tie 12–1 on aggregate.[16]
Bayern Munich[edit]
In February 2009, Müller signed his first contract for the senior team, a two-year deal effective from the 2009–10 season, along with reserve teammate Holger Badstuber.[17]
2009–10 season[edit]
See also: 2009–10 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller was prepared to be loaned or even transferred away to find first-team football,[15] but when Louis van Gaal was appointed manager, both players became fixtures in the Bayern first team from the start of the season.[18] In the first few matches, Müller was a regular substitute, and on 12 September 2009, he was brought on against Borussia Dortmund and scored two goals in a 5–1 victory.[19] Three days later, he scored another brace in a 3–0 Champions League victory over Maccabi Haifa.[20] He rounded off September by being named the Bundesliga Player of the Month[21] and earned praise from his namesake, legendary former Bayern and Germany striker Gerd Müller.[22] After the Haifa match, Müller was in the starting XI for almost every match,[23] only missing one match, a Champions League match against Bordeaux, for which he was suspended,[24] because he was sent off in an earlier match against the same team.[25]
In February 2010, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern Munich through 2013.[26] During the second half of the season, Müller continued to be a regular first-team starter,[18] usually playing in a central striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04,[27] and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career,[28] in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern.[29] The title was confirmed a week later with a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC,[30][31] a match which Müller started.
For the season, he played in all 34 Bundesliga matches,[32] starting 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists.[18] Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in the final of the DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double.[33] Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season.[34] Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milano at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. It was not to be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César.[35] Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat,[15] but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.[18]
In a poll conducted by the sports magazine kicker, he was voted by his fellow professionals as the best newcomer of the 2009–10 season[36] and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.[37] Müller credits Van Gaal for having had the biggest part to play in his rise to success – the coach arrived with a reputation for promoting youth team players, particularly at Ajax, and consistently gave Müller his chance in the first-team, going as far to say "Müller spielt bei mir immer" ("with me, Müller will always play").[38] Müller, in return, described Van Gaal as "a genius technician" who makes players "improve every time".[15]

Müller with Bayern Munich in Saint Petersburg, Russia, May 2011


Müller returned from his post-World Cup break to sign another contract extension, this time extending his stay at Bayern until 2015.[39] As with all of Bayern's World Cup participants, he missed much of pre-season,[40] and his first match back was the Supercup against Schalke 04 on 7 August.[41] He was named in the starting 11, and scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win.[42] Two weeks later he scored the opening goal of Bayern's league season in a 2–1 home win against VfL Wolfsburg.[43] Müller played in every match of the first half of the season, usually as a starter,[44] but as the team struggled for results, Müller was unable to match the previous season's goalscoring exploits,[44] being dropped to the bench,[38] and even receiving a telling off from Louis van Gaal after missing an easy chance in a 2–0 defeat against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in August.[15][45] He was philosophical about this dip in form, though,[46] and after eight league games without a goal, he scored in a 4–1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt on 27 November;[47] He followed that by scoring in consecutive league and cup wins against VfB Stuttgart three weeks later.[48][49] These goals took his tally to eight goals in all competitions[44] and included a spectacular goal to open the scoring in a 2–0 Champions League victory against Roma on 15 September.[15][50]
As his team was on its winter break, Müller was left to reflect on what he described as "an almost unbelievable first year as a pro".[46] Müller began the second half of the season in good form, but was involved in an altercation with teammate Arjen Robben, who was angered when Müller showed his displeasure at a poor free-kick Robben took during a 3–1 win at Werder Bremen.[51] Müller again played in every game of the season[52] and scored 19 goals (12 in the league),[53] but the season was less successful for Bayern, as they finished third in the league,[54] and were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the semi-finals by Schalke 04[55] and in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League by Inter Milan; Bayern had won 1–0 at the San Siro, and Müller scored 31 minutes into the second leg to make it 3–1 on aggregate, but Inter levelled the score at 3–3 in the 88th minute to go through on the away goals rule.[56] Müller's mentor Van Gaal was increasingly criticised for inflexibility in tactical, transfer and selection policy,[57] and ultimately lost his job, being replaced with Jupp Heynckes.[58]
2011–12 season[edit]
See also: 2011–12 FC Bayern Munich season
In Bayern's first DFB-Pokal game Müller was awarded the man of the match after earning two penalties which were converted by Mario Gómez and Bastian Schweinsteiger, Müller then added a third in the closing stages to secure a 3–0 victory over Eintracht Braunschweig.[59] It took Müller five matches for him to get his first league goal; he scored it against Schalke 04 in Bayern's 2–0 win. Müller then scored in Bayern's next home game in the early stages of the match, which the went on to win, 3–0. On 26 November 2011, Müller netted the opener on the half-hour in Bayern's 6–0 thrashing of FC Ingolstadt, giving him his second DFB-Pokal goal.[60] Müller was on the short-list of this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or award.[61] On 10 and 15 January, in Bayern's warm up friendlies, Müller scored three goals in two games, a brace against the India national team (which Bayern then went on to win 4–0)[62] and one goal in Bayern's other 4–0 victory over Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[63] Müller provided two assists in Bayern's win over VfB Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 February, Bayern played 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Müller ended a goal drought lasting since 24 September 2011 with a header in their 2–0 victory.[64] On 31 March 2012, Müller played his 100th Bundesliga game against 1. FC Nürnberg.[65][66] On 19 May 2012, Müller scored the opening goal in the Champions League final against Chelsea with a powerful header. He was substituted shortly afterwards. Bayern Munich, however, lost the final on penalties. Müller stated how dissatisfied he was about the amount of time he had spent on the bench recently.[67] Müller said that although he was dissatisfied he wanted to stay at Bayern.[67] During the season, Müller scored seven goals in 34 league matches, two goals in five German Cup matches, and two goals in 14 Champions League matches.[68]
2012–13 season[edit]
See also: 2012–13 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller's first Bundesliga goal of the season came over 2. Bundesliga champions SpVgg Greuther Fürth in Bayern's 3–0 victory on 27 August 2012.[69] On 2 September, he netted a brace as Bayern thrashed southern rivals VfB Stuttgart, 6–1, in front of 71,000 at the newly expanded Allianz Arena.[70][71] Müller helped Bayern achieve a record-breaking start to the league season, when he netted a brace over newly promoted Fortuna Düsseldorf on 20 October in their 5–0 victory, recording Bayern's eighth successive win.[72] Three days later, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season, netting from the penalty spot, as Bayern defeated Lille 1–0 at the French side's newly built Grand Stade Lille Métropole.[73]
On 13 December, after his good run of form in the first half of the Bundesliga season, Müller pledged his allegiance claiming he was at home in Munich and that, "There is no club to step up from when you leave FC Bayern... there almost is no better club."[74] Six days later, he signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the Allianz Arena until 2017.[75] At the winter break in the Bundesliga, he had nine goals and seven assists in 16 league appearances and a further three goals in the Champions League;[74] this gave him a total of 13 goals halfway through the season, including his strike against Borussia Dortmund in Bayern's win in the 2012 DFL-Supercup. Müller scored his first goal in Bayern's second game back from the break in a 2–0 away win over VfB Stuttgart. Müller tapped in his fifth goal of the Champions League campaign on 2 April, completing a 2–0 first leg defeat of Juventus in the quarter-finals, ending the Italian club's 18-match unbeaten record in Europe.[76] On 23 April 2013, Müller scored two goals and gave one assist in 4–0 win against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final in the Allianz Arena.[77] On the return fixture, Müller scored a header as Bayern won 3–0 and gave Barcelona their biggest defeat ever in the Champions League, with a 7–0 aggregate score.[78] Müller then went on to play an important role in Bayern's 2–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the final. On 1 June, Müller scored a penalty in the final of the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal.[79] Bayern won the cup 3–2 to complete an historic treble. Müller scored 23 goals overall in the season (including all competitions), netting 13 in the Bundesliga,[80] one in the Pokal,[80] and an impressive eight in the Champions League,[80] he also added one in the 2012 DFL-Supercup which Bayern won 2–1.[81] This topped off Müller's highest scoring season to date.[82]

Müller began the 2013–14 season by playing in the German Super Cup. by scoring in seven of Bayern's 12 pre-season games. His first competitive match came against Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup.[83] On 5 August, Müller scored a hat-trick as Bayern won 5–0 in the team's 2013–14 DFB-Pokal first-round game against Schwarz-Weiß Rehden. In Bayern's opening 2013–14 Bundesliga fixture, Müller missed a penalty for the first time. Seconds later, the save from the penalty flicked the hand of Álvaro Domínguez which resulted in another penalty which David Alaba converted. After this, Müller stated, "I am still happy to take penalties, but I think David Alaba is the main man for spot kicks for now." He played in the UEFA Super Cup.[84] On 25 September, against Hannover 96 in the second round of the DFB-Pokal, Müller scored twice taking his cup tally to five goals in just two games. On 28 September, Müller scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over VfL Wolfsburg, giving him his first goal in the 2013–14 Bundesliga. Müller scored his first 2013–14 UEFA Champions League goal of the campaign and Bayern defeated Manchester City 3–1 at the City of Manchester Stadium on 2 October. He played in a match at the FIFA Club World Cup.[85]

After the 2013–14 season, Müller signed a new contract keeping him at Bayern until 2019[89] and rejected a contract offer from Manchester United.[5][90] Müller played in the DFL-Supercup,[91] which was Bayern's first match in the 2014–15 season. Bayern lost the match 2–0.[91] His first goal of the season was against Preußen Münster in the DFB-Pokal on 17 August 2014.[92] Then in the opening match of the Bundesliga,[93] on 22 August 2014,[94] Müller scored the opening goal of Bayern's Bundesliga season against VfL Wolfsburg.[95] Bayern went on to win the match 2–1.[94] On 11 March 2015, Müller scored two goals against Shakhtar Donetsk in a 7–0 win[96] to draw level with former teammate Mario Gómez as the top-scoring German player in UEFA Champions League history.[97] He subsequently became the leader when he scored in a 6–1 win against Porto on 21 April 2015.[98] He finished the season with 13 goals in 32 league matches, a goal in five DFB-Pokal matches, and seven goals in ten Champions League matches.[99]
2015–16 season[edit]
See also: 2015–16 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller started the season by playing in the DFL-Supercup against VfL Wolfsburg.[100] He started the league season with two goals against Hamburger SV,[101] a goal against 1899 Hoffenheim,[102] two goals against Bayer Leverkusen,[103] and a goal against FC Augsburg[104] in the first four matchdays. He had scored from the penalty spot against Bayer Leverkusen[103] and Augsburg.[104] He failed to score in his next three Bundesliga matches.[105] He failed to convert a penalty shot against Mainz 05 on matchday seven.[106] His next Bundesliga goal came when he scored two goals against Borussia Dortmund on matchday eight.[105] One of the goals was scored from the penalty spot.[107] His goalscoring continued in other competitions. He scored two goals against Wolfsburg in the second round of the DFB-Pokal,[108] and in Champions League, two goals against Olympiacos,[109] two goals against Arsenal,[110] and a goal in the return leg against Olympiacos.[111] In scoring in the home win over Olympiacos, Müller became the youngest player to win 50 UEFA Champions League games, beating the record of Lionel Messi by 14 months.[112]
On 9 December 2015, Müller came on as a 46th-minute substitute for Franck Ribéry in a 2–0 win against Dinamo Zagreb.[113] He failed to convert his penalty shot in the match[114] and finished the group stage with five goals from six appearances.[105] On 18 December 2015, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern, keeping him at the club until 2021.[115] On 19 December 2015,[116] Bayern defeated Hannover 96 1–0[116] with a goal from the penalty mark from Müller.[117] Bayern went on winter break after the match.[117] Müller finished the first half of the league with 14 goals from 17 appearances.[105] This includes scoring five goals from the penalty mark in six opportunities.[105] He had scored 21 goals in 25 appearances in all competitions up until the winter break.[100][105]
On 12 March 2016, Müller scored a brace in a 5–0 victory over Werder Bremen.[118] Four days later, with Bayern trailing Juventus 1–2 in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, he scored a 91st-minute equaliser before Bayern won in extra time 4–2 (6–4 aggregate).[119]
On 19 April 2016, Müller scored both goals in Bayern's 2–0 defeat of Werder Bremen in the DFB-Pokal semi-final. His first goal of the match was his 150th for the club in all competitions.[120]
On 3 May 2016, Müller had a penalty kick saved by Jan Oblak in the Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Atlético Madrid. The match ended in a 2–1 win for Bayern but the team was knocked out on the away goals rule.[121]
He finished the season by scoring 20 goals in 31 league matches, four goals in five German Cup matches, and eight goals in 12 Champions League matches.[105] He didn't score in the German Super Cup.[100]
2016–17 season[edit]
Müller started the season by winning and scoring in the 2016 DFL-Supercup against Borussia Dortmund on 14 August 2016.[122] In the league, Müller did not score for 999 minutes until he scored during a home game against VfL Wolfsburg in the 76th minute.[123]
International career[edit]

Müller represented Germany at various youth levels, starting with the under-16s in 2004.[125] In August 2009, he was called up to the under-21 team for his debut in a 3–1 friendly defeat against Turkey.[126] He earned six caps for the under-21s and scored one goal,[127] the eighth in an 11–0 thrashing of San Marino.[128]
In October of the same year, Müller's regular appearances for Bayern's first team caused Germany national team manager Joachim Löw to publicly consider him for a call-up,[129][130] despite initial reluctance from the Bayern Munich board;[131] the following month, Müller was named in the squad for a friendly against the Ivory Coast.[132] However, this coincided with the death of national team goalkeeper Robert Enke, which led to the cancellation of a match against Chile the same week.[133] With less opportunity to try out new players, and with the under-21 team facing crucial qualifiers for the 2011 European Championship, Löw and under-21 manager Rainer Adrion felt that Müller was needed at the under-21 level, and Müller was called back into the under-21s.[134]
He was back in the senior squad for its next get-together, a training session in Sindelfingen in January 2010,[135] and was named in the squad for the following match, a friendly against Argentina in March.[136] He made his debut in this game in the starting XI at the Allianz Arena, his home stadium with Bayern. He was substituted in the 66th minute for fellow debutant Toni Kroos as Germany lost 1–0.[137]
2010 World Cup[edit]
Müller was named in Germany's provisional 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players.[138] Despite suffering a scare when he fell off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol,[139] Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players.[140] He was allocated the number 13,[141] normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack,[141] and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd.[141] He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[142] He started the first game of Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia,[143] winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process.[144] He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16.[145] In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal.[146] However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball[147] and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play.[15] He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals.[148] The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.[149]
With five goals Müller ended as joint top goalscorer of the tournament. He earned the Golden Boot with these goals and his three assists.[150] He also won the Best Young Player Award over fellow nominees André Ayew of Ghana and Giovani dos Santos of Mexico.[151] For both awards, he succeeded a German teammate, Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski, respectively, from 2006.[152]
In October 2010, he was named on the shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award along with four of his Germany teammates.[153] Reflecting on his World Cup success, Müller said "I basically got lucky, I hit form at just the right time".[46]
Euro 2012[edit]
Müller started all ten of Germany's qualifiers for Euro 2012, as the team qualified for the finals with a 100% record. Müller provided assists for seven goals,[154] three of which came in a 6–2 win over Austria in September 2011 which secured Germany's qualification for the finals with two games to spare.[155] He scored three times in the campaign, two goals coming in a 4–0 win over Kazakhstan in March 2011,[156] the third in a 3–1 win over Turkey in October of the same year.[157]
Müller was included in Joachim Löw's squad for Euro 2012, where the Germans were knocked out in the semi-finals by Italy.
2014 World Cup[edit]

Müller scored his first World Cup qualifying goals on 22 March 2013, scoring Germany's opener and final goal in a 3–0 away win over Kazakhstan.[158] He also scored in the 3–0 victories over Austria and the Faroe Islands to give him four goals in Germany's successful qualification campaign.
On 16 June 2014, in Germany's opening match of the 2014 World Cup,[159] Müller scored the first hat-trick of the tournament and was named man of the match in a 4–0 win against Portugal.[160] In addition, he was also the target of Pepe's headbutt in the 37th minute, which resulted in the Portuguese defender being sent off.[159][160] He denied that he had "overplayed" the situation leading to the red card.[161] On 26 June, Müller scored the only goal of the final group match against the United States to help the Germans win Group G and dispelled fear of collusion between German coach Joachim Löw and American coach Jürgen Klinsmann to play to a draw as had occurred in 1982.[162]
On 8 July, he scored Germany's opening goal in the 7–1 semi-final defeat of Brazil.[163] This goal was Germany's 2,000th goal in its history. Müller has now scored at least five goals in each of his first two World Cups, making him only the third player to do so (after Teófilo Cubillas and teammate Miroslav Klose).[164] With the goal, he has tied Helmut Rahn with 10 World Cup goals.[164]
On 11 July, Müller was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.[165] Having played a major role in the team's World Cup triumph, Müller received the Silver Boot as the tournament's second top goalscorer with five goals,[5] and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI.[166]
Euro 2016[edit]
Müller featured in nine of ten matches during Germany's qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2016, scoring nine goals as Germany topped their qualifying group to qualify for Euro 2016.[167]
Müller started in all six matches that Germany played at the Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy,[168] Müller's shot was the first one to be saved in the penalty shoot-out during the tournament.[168] This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup.[168] Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5.[168] Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.
Style of play[edit]
Müller's role can be described as an attacking all-rounder,[149] a player able to play in a variety of forward positions. As he came through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder,[15] but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more forward roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4-2-3-1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern,[169] and on the right for Germany.[170] He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.[171]
Müller has been praised for his maturity,[172] pace, technique,[173] awareness and positioning.[46] He has been particularly noted for his composure; Germany manager Joachim Löw said he is "impervious to pressure"[15] and former Bayern manager Louis van Gaal said he has tremendous mental strength.[46] A consistent scorer and creator of goals,[174] he describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one-on-ones.[15] Müller describes this role as Raumdeuter,[175] a term that translates to "interpreter of space" (cf. Raumdeuter, "space interpreter"). During 2014 World Cup, Germany manager Joachim Löw stated that Müller "is a very unorthodox player and you can't really predict his lines of running, but he has one aim and that is 'how can I score a goal?".[176]
Personal life[edit]
Müller was born in Weilheim, Upper Bavaria, and grew up in the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media attention during his World Cup exploits.[177] His parents are Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, Simon, who is two and a half years younger.[177] He married his long-time girlfriend Lisa Trede, a semi-professional equestrian who works on a farm,[178] in December 2009 after being engaged for two years.[179] In June 2011, he became an ambassador for YoungWings, a charity that helps children who have suffered bereavement or trauma.[180]

Thomas Müller (German pronunciation: [ˈtʰoː.mas ˈmʏ.lɐ]; born 13 September 1989) is a German professional footballer who plays for Bayern Munich and the Germany national team. A very versatile player, Müller plays as a midfielder or forward, and has been deployed in a variety of attacking roles – as an attacking midfielder, second striker, centre forward and on either wing. He has been praised for his positioning, teamwork and stamina, work-rate, and has shown consistency in scoring and creating goals.[3]
A product of Bayern's youth system, he made his first-team breakthrough in the 2009–10 season after Louis van Gaal was appointed as the main coach; he played almost every game as the club won the league and cup double and reached the Champions League final. Müller scored 23 goals in the 2012–13 season as Bayern won a historic treble; the league title, cup and Champions League.
Müller earned a call-up to the German national team in 2010. At the 2010 World Cup he scored five goals in six appearances as Germany finished in third place. He was named the Best Young Player of the tournament and won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer, with five goals and three assists. At the 2014 World Cup he played a major role in helping the team win the trophy, scoring five goals and receiving the Silver Ball as the tounament's second top player and the Silver Boot as the second top goalscorer, and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI and in the Dream Team.
In 2014, Müller was ranked the fifth-best footballer in the world by The Guardian.[4]

Club career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Born in Weilheim, Müller played as a youth for TSV Pähl, and at the age of 10[5] he made the 50 km journey to join local Bundesliga side Bayern Munich in 2000.[2] He progressed through the youth system and was part of the team that finished runner-up in the Under 19 Bundesliga in 2007.[6] He made his debut for the reserve team in March 2008 when he replaced Stephan Fürstner in a Regionalliga match against SpVgg Unterhaching,[7] in which he scored. He made two more Regionalliga appearances in the 2007–08 season,[8] while continuing to play for the under-19 team. The following season, Bayern's second string qualified for the newly formed 3. Liga, and Müller established himself as a key player – he played in 32 out of 38 matches[9] and scored 15 times[10] to make him the league's fifth top scorer.[11] He also became involved in the first-team under then manager Jürgen Klinsmann; he appeared in pre-season friendlies,[12][13] and made his full debut on 15 August 2008, when he came on as a substitute for Miroslav Klose for the last ten minutes of a Bundesliga match against Hamburger SV.[14] Despite Müller feeling that his performance did not go well,[15] he made three more Bundesliga appearances that season[9] and made his Champions League debut on 10 March 2009 when he was substituted on in the 72nd minute for Bastian Schweinsteiger in a 7–1 win over Sporting CP. He scored Bayern's last goal as they won the tie 12–1 on aggregate.[16]
Bayern Munich[edit]
In February 2009, Müller signed his first contract for the senior team, a two-year deal effective from the 2009–10 season, along with reserve teammate Holger Badstuber.[17]
2009–10 season[edit]
See also: 2009–10 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller was prepared to be loaned or even transferred away to find first-team football,[15] but when Louis van Gaal was appointed manager, both players became fixtures in the Bayern first team from the start of the season.[18] In the first few matches, Müller was a regular substitute, and on 12 September 2009, he was brought on against Borussia Dortmund and scored two goals in a 5–1 victory.[19] Three days later, he scored another brace in a 3–0 Champions League victory over Maccabi Haifa.[20] He rounded off September by being named the Bundesliga Player of the Month[21] and earned praise from his namesake, legendary former Bayern and Germany striker Gerd Müller.[22] After the Haifa match, Müller was in the starting XI for almost every match,[23] only missing one match, a Champions League match against Bordeaux, for which he was suspended,[24] because he was sent off in an earlier match against the same team.[25]
In February 2010, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern Munich through 2013.[26] During the second half of the season, Müller continued to be a regular first-team starter,[18] usually playing in a central striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04,[27] and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career,[28] in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern.[29] The title was confirmed a week later with a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC,[30][31] a match which Müller started.
For the season, he played in all 34 Bundesliga matches,[32] starting 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists.[18] Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in the final of the DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double.[33] Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season.[34] Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milano at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. It was not to be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César.[35] Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat,[15] but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.[18]
In a poll conducted by the sports magazine kicker, he was voted by his fellow professionals as the best newcomer of the 2009–10 season[36] and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.[37] Müller credits Van Gaal for having had the biggest part to play in his rise to success – the coach arrived with a reputation for promoting youth team players, particularly at Ajax, and consistently gave Müller his chance in the first-team, going as far to say "Müller spielt bei mir immer" ("with me, Müller will always play").[38] Müller, in return, described Van Gaal as "a genius technician" who makes players "improve every time".[15]

Müller with Bayern Munich in Saint Petersburg, Russia, May 2011


Müller returned from his post-World Cup break to sign another contract extension, this time extending his stay at Bayern until 2015.[39] As with all of Bayern's World Cup participants, he missed much of pre-season,[40] and his first match back was the Supercup against Schalke 04 on 7 August.[41] He was named in the starting 11, and scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win.[42] Two weeks later he scored the opening goal of Bayern's league season in a 2–1 home win against VfL Wolfsburg.[43] Müller played in every match of the first half of the season, usually as a starter,[44] but as the team struggled for results, Müller was unable to match the previous season's goalscoring exploits,[44] being dropped to the bench,[38] and even receiving a telling off from Louis van Gaal after missing an easy chance in a 2–0 defeat against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in August.[15][45] He was philosophical about this dip in form, though,[46] and after eight league games without a goal, he scored in a 4–1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt on 27 November;[47] He followed that by scoring in consecutive league and cup wins against VfB Stuttgart three weeks later.[48][49] These goals took his tally to eight goals in all competitions[44] and included a spectacular goal to open the scoring in a 2–0 Champions League victory against Roma on 15 September.[15][50]
As his team was on its winter break, Müller was left to reflect on what he described as "an almost unbelievable first year as a pro".[46] Müller began the second half of the season in good form, but was involved in an altercation with teammate Arjen Robben, who was angered when Müller showed his displeasure at a poor free-kick Robben took during a 3–1 win at Werder Bremen.[51] Müller again played in every game of the season[52] and scored 19 goals (12 in the league),[53] but the season was less successful for Bayern, as they finished third in the league,[54] and were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the semi-finals by Schalke 04[55] and in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League by Inter Milan; Bayern had won 1–0 at the San Siro, and Müller scored 31 minutes into the second leg to make it 3–1 on aggregate, but Inter levelled the score at 3–3 in the 88th minute to go through on the away goals rule.[56] Müller's mentor Van Gaal was increasingly criticised for inflexibility in tactical, transfer and selection policy,[57] and ultimately lost his job, being replaced with Jupp Heynckes.[58]
2011–12 season[edit]
See also: 2011–12 FC Bayern Munich season
In Bayern's first DFB-Pokal game Müller was awarded the man of the match after earning two penalties which were converted by Mario Gómez and Bastian Schweinsteiger, Müller then added a third in the closing stages to secure a 3–0 victory over Eintracht Braunschweig.[59] It took Müller five matches for him to get his first league goal; he scored it against Schalke 04 in Bayern's 2–0 win. Müller then scored in Bayern's next home game in the early stages of the match, which the went on to win, 3–0. On 26 November 2011, Müller netted the opener on the half-hour in Bayern's 6–0 thrashing of FC Ingolstadt, giving him his second DFB-Pokal goal.[60] Müller was on the short-list of this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or award.[61] On 10 and 15 January, in Bayern's warm up friendlies, Müller scored three goals in two games, a brace against the India national team (which Bayern then went on to win 4–0)[62] and one goal in Bayern's other 4–0 victory over Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[63] Müller provided two assists in Bayern's win over VfB Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 February, Bayern played 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Müller ended a goal drought lasting since 24 September 2011 with a header in their 2–0 victory.[64] On 31 March 2012, Müller played his 100th Bundesliga game against 1. FC Nürnberg.[65][66] On 19 May 2012, Müller scored the opening goal in the Champions League final against Chelsea with a powerful header. He was substituted shortly afterwards. Bayern Munich, however, lost the final on penalties. Müller stated how dissatisfied he was about the amount of time he had spent on the bench recently.[67] Müller said that although he was dissatisfied he wanted to stay at Bayern.[67] During the season, Müller scored seven goals in 34 league matches, two goals in five German Cup matches, and two goals in 14 Champions League matches.[68]
2012–13 season[edit]
See also: 2012–13 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller's first Bundesliga goal of the season came over 2. Bundesliga champions SpVgg Greuther Fürth in Bayern's 3–0 victory on 27 August 2012.[69] On 2 September, he netted a brace as Bayern thrashed southern rivals VfB Stuttgart, 6–1, in front of 71,000 at the newly expanded Allianz Arena.[70][71] Müller helped Bayern achieve a record-breaking start to the league season, when he netted a brace over newly promoted Fortuna Düsseldorf on 20 October in their 5–0 victory, recording Bayern's eighth successive win.[72] Three days later, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season, netting from the penalty spot, as Bayern defeated Lille 1–0 at the French side's newly built Grand Stade Lille Métropole.[73]
On 13 December, after his good run of form in the first half of the Bundesliga season, Müller pledged his allegiance claiming he was at home in Munich and that, "There is no club to step up from when you leave FC Bayern... there almost is no better club."[74] Six days later, he signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the Allianz Arena until 2017.[75] At the winter break in the Bundesliga, he had nine goals and seven assists in 16 league appearances and a further three goals in the Champions League;[74] this gave him a total of 13 goals halfway through the season, including his strike against Borussia Dortmund in Bayern's win in the 2012 DFL-Supercup. Müller scored his first goal in Bayern's second game back from the break in a 2–0 away win over VfB Stuttgart. Müller tapped in his fifth goal of the Champions League campaign on 2 April, completing a 2–0 first leg defeat of Juventus in the quarter-finals, ending the Italian club's 18-match unbeaten record in Europe.[76] On 23 April 2013, Müller scored two goals and gave one assist in 4–0 win against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final in the Allianz Arena.[77] On the return fixture, Müller scored a header as Bayern won 3–0 and gave Barcelona their biggest defeat ever in the Champions League, with a 7–0 aggregate score.[78] Müller then went on to play an important role in Bayern's 2–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the final. On 1 June, Müller scored a penalty in the final of the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal.[79] Bayern won the cup 3–2 to complete an historic treble. Müller scored 23 goals overall in the season (including all competitions), netting 13 in the Bundesliga,[80] one in the Pokal,[80] and an impressive eight in the Champions League,[80] he also added one in the 2012 DFL-Supercup which Bayern won 2–1.[81] This topped off Müller's highest scoring season to date.[82]

In Bayern's opening 2013–14 Bundesliga fixture, Müller missed a penalty for the first time. Seconds later, the save from the penalty flicked the hand of Álvaro Domínguez which resulted in another penalty which David Alaba converted. After this, Müller stated, "I am still happy to take penalties, but I think David Alaba is the main man for spot kicks for now." He played in the UEFA Super Cup.[84] On 25 September, against Hannover 96 in the second round of the DFB-Pokal, Müller scored twice taking his cup tally to five goals in just two games.

On 9 December 2015, Müller came on as a 46th-minute substitute for Franck Ribéry in a 2–0 win against Dinamo Zagreb.[113] He failed to convert his penalty shot in the match[114] and finished the group stage with five goals from six appearances.[105] On 18 December 2015, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern, keeping him at the club until 2021.[115] On 19 December 2015,[116] Bayern defeated Hannover 96 1–0[116] with a goal from the penalty mark from Müller.[117] Bayern went on winter break after the match.[117] Müller finished the first half of the league with 14 goals from 17 appearances.[105] This includes scoring five goals from the penalty mark in six opportunities.[105] He had scored 21 goals in 25 appearances in all competitions up until the winter break.[100][105]
On 12 March 2016, Müller scored a brace in a 5–0 victory over Werder Bremen.[118] Four days later, with Bayern trailing Juventus 1–2 in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, he scored a 91st-minute equaliser before Bayern won in extra time 4–2 (6–4 aggregate).[119]
On 19 April 2016, Müller scored both goals in Bayern's 2–0 defeat of Werder Bremen in the DFB-Pokal semi-final. His first goal of the match was his 150th for the club in all competitions.[120]
On 3 May 2016, Müller had a penalty kick saved by Jan Oblak in the Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Atlético Madrid. The match ended in a 2–1 win for Bayern but the team was knocked out on the away goals rule.[121]
He finished the season by scoring 20 goals in 31 league matches, four goals in five German Cup matches, and eight goals in 12 Champions League matches.[105] He didn't score in the German Super Cup.[100]
2016–17 season[edit]
Müller started the season by winning and scoring in the 2016 DFL-Supercup against Borussia Dortmund on 14 August 2016.[122] In the league, Müller did not score for 999 minutes until he scored during a home game against VfL Wolfsburg in the 76th minute.[123]
International career[edit]

Müller represented Germany at various youth levels, starting with the under-16s in 2004.[125] In August 2009, he was called up to the under-21 team for his debut in a 3–1 friendly defeat against Turkey.[126] He earned six caps for the under-21s and scored one goal,[127] the eighth in an 11–0 thrashing of San Marino.[128]
In October of the same year, Müller's regular appearances for Bayern's first team caused Germany national team manager Joachim Löw to publicly consider him for a call-up,[129][130] despite initial reluctance from the Bayern Munich board;[131] the following month, Müller was named in the squad for a friendly against the Ivory Coast.[132] However, this coincided with the death of national team goalkeeper Robert Enke, which led to the cancellation of a match against Chile the same week.[133] With less opportunity to try out new players, and with the under-21 team facing crucial qualifiers for the 2011 European Championship, Löw and under-21 manager Rainer Adrion felt that Müller was needed at the under-21 level, and Müller was called back into the under-21s.[134]
He was back in the senior squad for its next get-together, a training session in Sindelfingen in January 2010,[135] and was named in the squad for the following match, a friendly against Argentina in March.[136] He made his debut in this game in the starting XI at the Allianz Arena, his home stadium with Bayern. He was substituted in the 66th minute for fellow debutant Toni Kroos as Germany lost 1–0.[137]
2010 World Cup[edit]
Müller was named in Germany's provisional 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players.[138] Despite suffering a scare when he fell off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol,[139] Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players.[140] He was allocated the number 13,[141] normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack,[141] and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd.[141] He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[142] He started the first game of Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia,[143] winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process.[144] He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16.[145] In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal.[146] However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball[147] and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play.[15] He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals.[148] The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.[149]
With five goals Müller ended as joint top goalscorer of the tournament. He earned the Golden Boot with these goals and his three assists.[150] He also won the Best Young Player Award over fellow nominees André Ayew of Ghana and Giovani dos Santos of Mexico.[151] For both awards, he succeeded a German teammate, Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski, respectively, from 2006.[152]
In October 2010, he was named on the shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award along with four of his Germany teammates.[153] Reflecting on his World Cup success, Müller said "I basically got lucky, I hit form at just the right time".[46]
Euro 2012[edit]
Müller started all ten of Germany's qualifiers for Euro 2012, as the team qualified for the finals with a 100% record. Müller provided assists for seven goals,[154] three of which came in a 6–2 win over Austria in September 2011 which secured Germany's qualification for the finals with two games to spare.[155] He scored three times in the campaign, two goals coming in a 4–0 win over Kazakhstan in March 2011,[156] the third in a 3–1 win over Turkey in October of the same year.[157]
Müller was included in Joachim Löw's squad for Euro 2012, where the Germans were knocked out in the semi-finals by Italy.
2014 World Cup[edit]

Müller scored his first World Cup qualifying goals on 22 March 2013, scoring Germany's opener and final goal in a 3–0 away win over Kazakhstan.[158] He also scored in the 3–0 victories over Austria and the Faroe Islands to give him four goals in Germany's successful qualification campaign.
On 16 June 2014, in Germany's opening match of the 2014 World Cup,[159] Müller scored the first hat-trick of the tournament and was named man of the match in a 4–0 win against Portugal.[160] In addition, he was also the target of Pepe's headbutt in the 37th minute, which resulted in the Portuguese defender being sent off.[159][160] He denied that he had "overplayed" the situation leading to the red card.[161] On 26 June, Müller scored the only goal of the final group match against the United States to help the Germans win Group G and dispelled fear of collusion between German coach Joachim Löw and American coach Jürgen Klinsmann to play to a draw as had occurred in 1982.[162]
On 8 July, he scored Germany's opening goal in the 7–1 semi-final defeat of Brazil.[163] This goal was Germany's 2,000th goal in its history. Müller has now scored at least five goals in each of his first two World Cups, making him only the third player to do so (after Teófilo Cubillas and teammate Miroslav Klose).[164] With the goal, he has tied Helmut Rahn with 10 World Cup goals.[164]
On 11 July, Müller was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.[165] Having played a major role in the team's World Cup triumph, Müller received the Silver Boot as the tournament's second top goalscorer with five goals,[5] and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI.[166]
Euro 2016[edit]
Müller featured in nine of ten matches during Germany's qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2016, scoring nine goals as Germany topped their qualifying group to qualify for Euro 2016.[167]
Müller started in all six matches that Germany played at the Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy,[168] Müller's shot was the first one to be saved in the penalty shoot-out during the tournament.[168] This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup.[168] Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5.[168] Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.
Style of play[edit]
Müller's role can be described as an attacking all-rounder,[149] a player able to play in a variety of forward positions. As he came through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder,[15] but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more forward roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4-2-3-1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern,[169] and on the right for Germany.[170] He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.[171]
Müller has been praised for his maturity,[172] pace, technique,[173] awareness and positioning.[46] He has been particularly noted for his composure; Germany manager Joachim Löw said he is "impervious to pressure"[15] and former Bayern manager Louis van Gaal said he has tremendous mental strength.[46] A consistent scorer and creator of goals,[174] he describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one-on-ones.[15] Müller describes this role as Raumdeuter,[175] a term that translates to "interpreter of space" (cf. Raumdeuter, "space interpreter"). During 2014 World Cup, Germany manager Joachim Löw stated that Müller "is a very unorthodox player and you can't really predict his lines of running, but he has one aim and that is 'how can I score a goal?".[176]
Personal life[edit]
Müller was born in Weilheim, Upper Bavaria, and grew up in the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media attention during his World Cup exploits.[177] His parents are Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, Simon, who is two and a half years younger.[177] He married his long-time girlfriend Lisa Trede, a semi-professional equestrian who works on a farm,[178] in December 2009 after being engaged for two years.[179] In June 2011, he became an ambassador for YoungWings, a charity that helps children who have suffered bereavement or trauma.[180]

Thomas Müller (German pronunciation: [ˈtʰoː.mas ˈmʏ.lɐ]; born 13 September 1989) is a German professional footballer who plays for Bayern Munich and the Germany national team. A very versatile player, Müller plays as a midfielder or forward, and has been deployed in a variety of attacking roles – as an attacking midfielder, second striker, centre forward and on either wing. He has been praised for his positioning, teamwork and stamina, work-rate, and has shown consistency in scoring and creating goals.[3]
A product of Bayern's youth system, he made his first-team breakthrough in the 2009–10 season after Louis van Gaal was appointed as the main coach; he played almost every game as the club won the league and cup double and reached the Champions League final. Müller scored 23 goals in the 2012–13 season as Bayern won a historic treble; the league title, cup and Champions League.
Müller earned a call-up to the German national team in 2010. At the 2010 World Cup he scored five goals in six appearances as Germany finished in third place. He was named the Best Young Player of the tournament and won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer, with five goals and three assists. At the 2014 World Cup he played a major role in helping the team win the trophy, scoring five goals and receiving the Silver Ball as the tounament's second top player and the Silver Boot as the second top goalscorer, and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI and in the Dream Team.
In 2014, Müller was ranked the fifth-best footballer in the world by The Guardian.[4]

Club career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Born in Weilheim, Müller played as a youth for TSV Pähl, and at the age of 10[5] he made the 50 km journey to join local Bundesliga side Bayern Munich in 2000.[2] He progressed through the youth system and was part of the team that finished runner-up in the Under 19 Bundesliga in 2007.[6] He made his debut for the reserve team in March 2008 when he replaced Stephan Fürstner in a Regionalliga match against SpVgg Unterhaching,[7] in which he scored. He made two more Regionalliga appearances in the 2007–08 season,[8] while continuing to play for the under-19 team. The following season, Bayern's second string qualified for the newly formed 3. Liga, and Müller established himself as a key player – he played in 32 out of 38 matches[9] and scored 15 times[10] to make him the league's fifth top scorer.[11] He also became involved in the first-team under then manager Jürgen Klinsmann; he appeared in pre-season friendlies,[12][13] and made his full debut on 15 August 2008, when he came on as a substitute for Miroslav Klose for the last ten minutes of a Bundesliga match against Hamburger SV.[14] Despite Müller feeling that his performance did not go well,[15] he made three more Bundesliga appearances that season[9] and made his Champions League debut on 10 March 2009 when he was substituted on in the 72nd minute for Bastian Schweinsteiger in a 7–1 win over Sporting CP. He scored Bayern's last goal as they won the tie 12–1 on aggregate.[16]
Bayern Munich[edit]
In February 2009, Müller signed his first contract for the senior team, a two-year deal effective from the 2009–10 season, along with reserve teammate Holger Badstuber.[17]
2009–10 season[edit]
See also: 2009–10 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller was prepared to be loaned or even transferred away to find first-team football,[15] but when Louis van Gaal was appointed manager, both players became fixtures in the Bayern first team from the start of the season.[18] In the first few matches, Müller was a regular substitute, and on 12 September 2009, he was brought on against Borussia Dortmund and scored two goals in a 5–1 victory.[19] Three days later, he scored another brace in a 3–0 Champions League victory over Maccabi Haifa.[20] He rounded off September by being named the Bundesliga Player of the Month[21] and earned praise from his namesake, legendary former Bayern and Germany striker Gerd Müller.[22] After the Haifa match, Müller was in the starting XI for almost every match,[23] only missing one match, a Champions League match against Bordeaux, for which he was suspended,[24] because he was sent off in an earlier match against the same team.[25]
In February 2010, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern Munich through 2013.[26] During the second half of the season, Müller continued to be a regular first-team starter,[18] usually playing in a central striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04,[27] and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career,[28] in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern.[29] The title was confirmed a week later with a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC,[30][31] a match which Müller started.
For the season, he played in all 34 Bundesliga matches,[32] starting 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists.[18] Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in the final of the DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double.[33] Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season.[34] Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milano at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. It was not to be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César.[35] Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat,[15] but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.[18]
In a poll conducted by the sports magazine kicker, he was voted by his fellow professionals as the best newcomer of the 2009–10 season[36] and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.[37] Müller credits Van Gaal for having had the biggest part to play in his rise to success – the coach arrived with a reputation for promoting youth team players, particularly at Ajax, and consistently gave Müller his chance in the first-team, going as far to say "Müller spielt bei mir immer" ("with me, Müller will always play").[38] Müller, in return, described Van Gaal as "a genius technician" who makes players "improve every time".[15]

Müller with Bayern Munich in Saint Petersburg, Russia, May 2011


Müller returned from his post-World Cup break to sign another contract extension, this time extending his stay at Bayern until 2015.[39] As with all of Bayern's World Cup participants, he missed much of pre-season,[40] and his first match back was the Supercup against Schalke 04 on 7 August.[41] He was named in the starting 11, and scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win.[42] Two weeks later he scored the opening goal of Bayern's league season in a 2–1 home win against VfL Wolfsburg.[43] Müller played in every match of the first half of the season, usually as a starter,[44] but as the team struggled for results, Müller was unable to match the previous season's goalscoring exploits,[44] being dropped to the bench,[38] and even receiving a telling off from Louis van Gaal after missing an easy chance in a 2–0 defeat against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in August.[15][45] He was philosophical about this dip in form, though,[46] and after eight league games without a goal, he scored in a 4–1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt on 27 November;[47] He followed that by scoring in consecutive league and cup wins against VfB Stuttgart three weeks later.[48][49] These goals took his tally to eight goals in all competitions[44] and included a spectacular goal to open the scoring in a 2–0 Champions League victory against Roma on 15 September.[15][50]
As his team was on its winter break, Müller was left to reflect on what he described as "an almost unbelievable first year as a pro".[46] Müller began the second half of the season in good form, but was involved in an altercation with teammate Arjen Robben, who was angered when Müller showed his displeasure at a poor free-kick Robben took during a 3–1 win at Werder Bremen.[51] Müller again played in every game of the season[52] and scored 19 goals (12 in the league),[53] but the season was less successful for Bayern, as they finished third in the league,[54] and were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the semi-finals by Schalke 04[55] and in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League by Inter Milan; Bayern had won 1–0 at the San Siro, and Müller scored 31 minutes into the second leg to make it 3–1 on aggregate, but Inter levelled the score at 3–3 in the 88th minute to go through on the away goals rule.[56] Müller's mentor Van Gaal was increasingly criticised for inflexibility in tactical, transfer and selection policy,[57] and ultimately lost his job, being replaced with Jupp Heynckes.[58]
2011–12 season[edit]

In Bayern's first DFB-Pokal game Müller was awarded the man of the match after earning two penalties which were converted by Mario Gómez and Bastian Schweinsteiger, Müller then added a third in the closing stages to secure a 3–0 victory over Eintracht Braunschweig.[59] It took Müller five matches for him to get his first league goal; he scored it against Schalke 04 in Bayern's 2–0 win. Müller then scored in Bayern's next home game in the early stages of the match, which the went on to win, 3–0. On 26 November 2011, Müller netted the opener on the half-hour in Bayern's 6–0 thrashing of FC Ingolstadt, giving him his second DFB-Pokal goal.[60] Müller was on the short-list of this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or award.[61] On 10 and 15 January, in Bayern's warm up friendlies, Müller scored three goals in two games, a brace against the India national team (which Bayern then went on to win 4–0)[62] and one goal in Bayern's other 4–0 victory over Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[63] Müller provided two assists in Bayern's win over VfB Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 February, Bayern played 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Müller ended a goal drought lasting since 24 September 2011 with a header in their 2–0 victory.[64] On 31 March 2012, Müller played his 100th Bundesliga game against 1. FC Nürnberg.[65][66] On 19 May 2012, Müller scored the opening goal in the Champions League final against Chelsea with a powerful header. He was substituted shortly afterwards. Bayern Munich, however, lost the final on penalties. Müller stated how dissatisfied he was about the amount of time he had spent on the bench recently.[67] Müller said that although he was dissatisfied he wanted to stay at Bayern.[67] During the season, Müller scored seven goals in 34 league matches, two goals in five German Cup matches, and two goals in 14 Champions League matches.[68]
2012–13 season[edit]
See also: 2012–13 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller's first Bundesliga goal of the season came over 2. Bundesliga champions SpVgg Greuther Fürth in Bayern's 3–0 victory on 27 August 2012.[69] On 2 September, he netted a brace as Bayern thrashed southern rivals VfB Stuttgart, 6–1, in front of 71,000 at the newly expanded Allianz Arena.[70][71] Müller helped Bayern achieve a record-breaking start to the league season, when he netted a brace over newly promoted Fortuna Düsseldorf on 20 October in their 5–0 victory, recording Bayern's eighth successive win.[72] Three days later, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season, netting from the penalty spot, as Bayern defeated Lille 1–0 at the French side's newly built Grand Stade Lille Métropole.[73]
On 13 December, after his good run of form in the first half of the Bundesliga season, Müller pledged his allegiance claiming he was at home in Munich and that, "There is no club to step up from when you leave FC Bayern... there almost is no better club."[74] Six days later, he signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the Allianz Arena until 2017.[75] At the winter break in the Bundesliga, he had nine goals and seven assists in 16 league appearances and a further three goals in the Champions League;[74] this gave him a total of 13 goals halfway through the season, including his strike against Borussia Dortmund in Bayern's win in the 2012 DFL-Supercup. Müller scored his first goal in Bayern's second game back from the break in a 2–0 away win over VfB Stuttgart. Müller tapped in his fifth goal of the Champions League campaign on 2 April, completing a 2–0 first leg defeat of Juventus in the quarter-finals, ending the Italian club's 18-match unbeaten record in Europe.[76] On 23 April 2013, Müller scored two goals and gave one assist in 4–0 win against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final in the Allianz Arena.[77] On the return fixture, Müller scored a header as Bayern won 3–0 and gave Barcelona their biggest defeat ever in the Champions League, with a 7–0 aggregate score.[78] Müller then went on to play an important role in Bayern's 2–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the final. On 1 June, Müller scored a penalty in the final of the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal.[79] Bayern won the cup 3–2 to complete an historic treble. Müller scored 23 goals overall in the season (including all competitions), netting 13 in the Bundesliga,[80] one in the Pokal,[80] and an impressive eight in the Champions League,[80] he also added one in the 2012 DFL-Supercup which Bayern won 2–1.[81] This topped off Müller's highest scoring season to date.[82]

Müller started the season by winning and scoring in the 2016 DFL-Supercup against Borussia Dortmund on 14 August 2016.[122] In the league, Müller did not score for 999 minutes until he scored during a home game against VfL Wolfsburg in the 76th minute.[123]
International career[edit]

Müller represented Germany at various youth levels, starting with the under-16s in 2004.[125] In August 2009, he was called up to the under-21 team for his debut in a 3–1 friendly defeat against Turkey.[126] He earned six caps for the under-21s and scored one goal,[127] the eighth in an 11–0 thrashing of San Marino.[128]
In October of the same year, Müller's regular appearances for Bayern's first team caused Germany national team manager Joachim Löw to publicly consider him for a call-up,[129][130] despite initial reluctance from the Bayern Munich board;[131] the following month, Müller was named in the squad for a friendly against the Ivory Coast.[132] However, this coincided with the death of national team goalkeeper Robert Enke, which led to the cancellation of a match against Chile the same week.[133] With less opportunity to try out new players, and with the under-21 team facing crucial qualifiers for the 2011 European Championship, Löw and under-21 manager Rainer Adrion felt that Müller was needed at the under-21 level, and Müller was called back into the under-21s.[134]
He was back in the senior squad for its next get-together, a training session in Sindelfingen in January 2010,[135] and was named in the squad for the following match, a friendly against Argentina in March.[136] He made his debut in this game in the starting XI at the Allianz Arena, his home stadium with Bayern. He was substituted in the 66th minute for fellow debutant Toni Kroos as Germany lost 1–0.[137]
2010 World Cup[edit]
Müller was named in Germany's provisional 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players.[138] Despite suffering a scare when he fell off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol,[139] Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players.[140] He was allocated the number 13,[141] normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack,[141] and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd.[141] He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[142] He started the first game of Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia,[143] winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process.[144] He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16.[145] In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal.[146] However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball[147] and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play.[15] He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals.[148] The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.[149]
With five goals Müller ended as joint top goalscorer of the tournament. He earned the Golden Boot with these goals and his three assists.[150] He also won the Best Young Player Award over fellow nominees André Ayew of Ghana and Giovani dos Santos of Mexico.[151] For both awards, he succeeded a German teammate, Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski, respectively, from 2006.[152]
In October 2010, he was named on the shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award along with four of his Germany teammates.[153] Reflecting on his World Cup success, Müller said "I basically got lucky, I hit form at just the right time".[46]
Euro 2012[edit]
Müller started all ten of Germany's qualifiers for Euro 2012, as the team qualified for the finals with a 100% record. Müller provided assists for seven goals,[154] three of which came in a 6–2 win over Austria in September 2011 which secured Germany's qualification for the finals with two games to spare.[155] He scored three times in the campaign, two goals coming in a 4–0 win over Kazakhstan in March 2011,[156] the third in a 3–1 win over Turkey in October of the same year.[157]
Müller was included in Joachim Löw's squad for Euro 2012, where the Germans were knocked out in the semi-finals by Italy.
2014 World Cup[edit]

Müller scored his first World Cup qualifying goals on 22 March 2013, scoring Germany's opener and final goal in a 3–0 away win over Kazakhstan.[158] He also scored in the 3–0 victories over Austria and the Faroe Islands to give him four goals in Germany's successful qualification campaign.
On 16 June 2014, in Germany's opening match of the 2014 World Cup,[159] Müller scored the first hat-trick of the tournament and was named man of the match in a 4–0 win against Portugal.[160] In addition, he was also the target of Pepe's headbutt in the 37th minute, which resulted in the Portuguese defender being sent off.[159][160] He denied that he had "overplayed" the situation leading to the red card.[161] On 26 June, Müller scored the only goal of the final group match against the United States to help the Germans win Group G and dispelled fear of collusion between German coach Joachim Löw and American coach Jürgen Klinsmann to play to a draw as had occurred in 1982.[162]
On 8 July, he scored Germany's opening goal in the 7–1 semi-final defeat of Brazil.[163] This goal was Germany's 2,000th goal in its history. Müller has now scored at least five goals in each of his first two World Cups, making him only the third player to do so (after Teófilo Cubillas and teammate Miroslav Klose).[164] With the goal, he has tied Helmut Rahn with 10 World Cup goals.[164]
On 11 July, Müller was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.[165] Having played a major role in the team's World Cup triumph, Müller received the Silver Boot as the tournament's second top goalscorer with five goals,[5] and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI.[166]
Euro 2016[edit]
Müller featured in nine of ten matches during Germany's qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2016, scoring nine goals as Germany topped their qualifying group to qualify for Euro 2016.[167]
Müller started in all six matches that Germany played at the Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy,[168] Müller's shot was the first one to be saved in the penalty shoot-out during the tournament.[168] This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup.[168] Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5.[168] Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.
Style of play[edit]
Müller's role can be described as an attacking all-rounder,[149] a player able to play in a variety of forward positions. As he came through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder,[15] but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more forward roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4-2-3-1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern,[169] and on the right for Germany.[170] He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.[171]
Müller has been praised for his maturity,[172] pace, technique,[173] awareness and positioning.[46] He has been particularly noted for his composure; Germany manager Joachim Löw said he is "impervious to pressure"[15] and former Bayern manager Louis van Gaal said he has tremendous mental strength.[46] A consistent scorer and creator of goals,[174] he describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one-on-ones.[15] Müller describes this role as Raumdeuter,[175] a term that translates to "interpreter of space" (cf. Raumdeuter, "space interpreter"). During 2014 World Cup, Germany manager Joachim Löw stated that Müller "is a very unorthodox player and you can't really predict his lines of running, but he has one aim and that is 'how can I score a goal?".[176]
Personal life[edit]
Müller was born in Weilheim, Upper Bavaria, and grew up in the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media attention during his World Cup exploits.[177] His parents are Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, Simon, who is two and a half years younger.[177] He married his long-time girlfriend Lisa Trede, a semi-professional equestrian who works on a farm,[178] in December 2009 after being engaged for two years.[179] In June 2011, he became an ambassador for YoungWings, a charity that helps children who have suffered bereavement or trauma.[180]

Thomas Müller (German pronunciation: [ˈtʰoː.mas ˈmʏ.lɐ]; born 13 September 1989) is a German professional footballer who plays for Bayern Munich and the Germany national team. A very versatile player, Müller plays as a midfielder or forward, and has been deployed in a variety of attacking roles – as an attacking midfielder, second striker, centre forward and on either wing. He has been praised for his positioning, teamwork and stamina, work-rate, and has shown consistency in scoring and creating goals.[3]
A product of Bayern's youth system, he made his first-team breakthrough in the 2009–10 season after Louis van Gaal was appointed as the main coach; he played almost every game as the club won the league and cup double and reached the Champions League final. Müller scored 23 goals in the 2012–13 season as Bayern won a historic treble; the league title, cup and Champions League.
Müller earned a call-up to the German national team in 2010. At the 2010 World Cup he scored five goals in six appearances as Germany finished in third place. He was named the Best Young Player of the tournament and won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer, with five goals and three assists. At the 2014 World Cup he played a major role in helping the team win the trophy, scoring five goals and receiving the Silver Ball as the tounament's second top player and the Silver Boot as the second top goalscorer, and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI and in the Dream Team.
In 2014, Müller was ranked the fifth-best footballer in the world by The Guardian.[4]

Club career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Born in Weilheim, Müller played as a youth for TSV Pähl, and at the age of 10[5] he made the 50 km journey to join local Bundesliga side Bayern Munich in 2000.[2] He progressed through the youth system and was part of the team that finished runner-up in the Under 19 Bundesliga in 2007.[6] He made his debut for the reserve team in March 2008 when he replaced Stephan Fürstner in a Regionalliga match against SpVgg Unterhaching,[7] in which he scored. He made two more Regionalliga appearances in the 2007–08 season,[8] while continuing to play for the under-19 team. The following season, Bayern's second string qualified for the newly formed 3. Liga, and Müller established himself as a key player – he played in 32 out of 38 matches[9] and scored 15 times[10] to make him the league's fifth top scorer.[11] He also became involved in the first-team under then manager Jürgen Klinsmann; he appeared in pre-season friendlies,[12][13] and made his full debut on 15 August 2008, when he came on as a substitute for Miroslav Klose for the last ten minutes of a Bundesliga match against Hamburger SV.[14] Despite Müller feeling that his performance did not go well,[15] he made three more Bundesliga appearances that season[9] and made his Champions League debut on 10 March 2009 when he was substituted on in the 72nd minute for Bastian Schweinsteiger in a 7–1 win over Sporting CP. He scored Bayern's last goal as they won the tie 12–1 on aggregate.[16]
Bayern Munich[edit]
In February 2009, Müller signed his first contract for the senior team, a two-year deal effective from the 2009–10 season, along with reserve teammate Holger Badstuber.[17]
2009–10 season[edit]
See also: 2009–10 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller was prepared to be loaned or even transferred away to find first-team football,[15] but when Louis van Gaal was appointed manager, both players became fixtures in the Bayern first team from the start of the season.[18] In the first few matches, Müller was a regular substitute, and on 12 September 2009, he was brought on against Borussia Dortmund and scored two goals in a 5–1 victory.[19] Three days later, he scored another brace in a 3–0 Champions League victory over Maccabi Haifa.[20] He rounded off September by being named the Bundesliga Player of the Month[21] and earned praise from his namesake, legendary former Bayern and Germany striker Gerd Müller.[22] After the Haifa match, Müller was in the starting XI for almost every match,[23] only missing one match, a Champions League match against Bordeaux, for which he was suspended,[24] because he was sent off in an earlier match against the same team.[25]
In February 2010, Müller signed a new contract with Bayern Munich through 2013.[26] During the second half of the season, Müller continued to be a regular first-team starter,[18] usually playing in a central striking role due to the availability of other wide players Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben. In April 2010, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 win against title rivals Schalke 04,[27] and in the penultimate league match of the season, he scored the first hat-trick of his career,[28] in a 3–1 win over VfL Bochum which effectively secured the German title for Bayern.[29] The title was confirmed a week later with a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC,[30][31] a match which Müller started.
For the season, he played in all 34 Bundesliga matches,[32] starting 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists.[18] Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in the final of the DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double.[33] Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season.[34] Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milano at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. It was not to be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César.[35] Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat,[15] but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.[18]
In a poll conducted by the sports magazine kicker, he was voted by his fellow professionals as the best newcomer of the 2009–10 season[36] and was named in the Bundesliga Team of the Season.[37] Müller credits Van Gaal for having had the biggest part to play in his rise to success – the coach arrived with a reputation for promoting youth team players, particularly at Ajax, and consistently gave Müller his chance in the first-team, going as far to say "Müller spielt bei mir immer" ("with me, Müller will always play").[38] Müller, in return, described Van Gaal as "a genius technician" who makes players "improve every time".[15]

Müller with Bayern Munich in Saint Petersburg, Russia, May 2011


Müller returned from his post-World Cup break to sign another contract extension, this time extending his stay at Bayern until 2015.[39] As with all of Bayern's World Cup participants, he missed much of pre-season,[40] and his first match back was the Supercup against Schalke 04 on 7 August.[41] He was named in the starting 11, and scored the opening goal in a 2–0 win.[42] Two weeks later he scored the opening goal of Bayern's league season in a 2–1 home win against VfL Wolfsburg.[43] Müller played in every match of the first half of the season, usually as a starter,[44] but as the team struggled for results, Müller was unable to match the previous season's goalscoring exploits,[44] being dropped to the bench,[38] and even receiving a telling off from Louis van Gaal after missing an easy chance in a 2–0 defeat against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in August.[15][45] He was philosophical about this dip in form, though,[46] and after eight league games without a goal, he scored in a 4–1 win against Eintracht Frankfurt on 27 November;[47] He followed that by scoring in consecutive league and cup wins against VfB Stuttgart three weeks later.[48][49] These goals took his tally to eight goals in all competitions[44] and included a spectacular goal to open the scoring in a 2–0 Champions League victory against Roma on 15 September.[15][50]
As his team was on its winter break, Müller was left to reflect on what he described as "an almost unbelievable first year as a pro".[46] Müller began the second half of the season in good form, but was involved in an altercation with teammate Arjen Robben, who was angered when Müller showed his displeasure at a poor free-kick Robben took during a 3–1 win at Werder Bremen.[51] Müller again played in every game of the season[52] and scored 19 goals (12 in the league),[53] but the season was less successful for Bayern, as they finished third in the league,[54] and were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the semi-finals by Schalke 04[55] and in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League by Inter Milan; Bayern had won 1–0 at the San Siro, and Müller scored 31 minutes into the second leg to make it 3–1 on aggregate, but Inter levelled the score at 3–3 in the 88th minute to go through on the away goals rule.[56] Müller's mentor Van Gaal was increasingly criticised for inflexibility in tactical, transfer and selection policy,[57] and ultimately lost his job, being replaced with Jupp Heynckes.[58]
2011–12 season[edit]

In Bayern's first DFB-Pokal game Müller was awarded the man of the match after earning two penalties which were converted by Mario Gómez and Bastian Schweinsteiger, Müller then added a third in the closing stages to secure a 3–0 victory over Eintracht Braunschweig.[59] It took Müller five matches for him to get his first league goal; he scored it against Schalke 04 in Bayern's 2–0 win. Müller then scored in Bayern's next home game in the early stages of the match, which the went on to win, 3–0. On 26 November 2011, Müller netted the opener on the half-hour in Bayern's 6–0 thrashing of FC Ingolstadt, giving him his second DFB-Pokal goal.[60] Müller was on the short-list of this year's FIFA Ballon d'Or award.[61] On 10 and 15 January, in Bayern's warm up friendlies, Müller scored three goals in two games, a brace against the India national team (which Bayern then went on to win 4–0)[62] and one goal in Bayern's other 4–0 victory over Rot-Weiß Erfurt.[63] Müller provided two assists in Bayern's win over VfB Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal. On 11 February, Bayern played 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Müller ended a goal drought lasting since 24 September 2011 with a header in their 2–0 victory.[64] On 31 March 2012, Müller played his 100th Bundesliga game against 1. FC Nürnberg.[65][66] On 19 May 2012, Müller scored the opening goal in the Champions League final against Chelsea with a powerful header. He was substituted shortly afterwards. Bayern Munich, however, lost the final on penalties. Müller stated how dissatisfied he was about the amount of time he had spent on the bench recently.[67] Müller said that although he was dissatisfied he wanted to stay at Bayern.[67] During the season, Müller scored seven goals in 34 league matches, two goals in five German Cup matches, and two goals in 14 Champions League matches.[68]
2012–13 season[edit]
See also: 2012–13 FC Bayern Munich season
Müller's first Bundesliga goal of the season came over 2. Bundesliga champions SpVgg Greuther Fürth in Bayern's 3–0 victory on 27 August 2012.[69] On 2 September, he netted a brace as Bayern thrashed southern rivals VfB Stuttgart, 6–1, in front of 71,000 at the newly expanded Allianz Arena.[70][71] Müller helped Bayern achieve a record-breaking start to the league season, when he netted a brace over newly promoted Fortuna Düsseldorf on 20 October in their 5–0 victory, recording Bayern's eighth successive win.[72] Three days later, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season, netting from the penalty spot, as Bayern defeated Lille 1–0 at the French side's newly built Grand Stade Lille Métropole.[73]
On 13 December, after his good run of form in the first half of the Bundesliga season, Müller pledged his allegiance claiming he was at home in Munich and that, "There is no club to step up from when you leave FC Bayern... there almost is no better club."[74] Six days later, he signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the Allianz Arena until 2017.[75] At the winter break in the Bundesliga, he had nine goals and seven assists in 16 league appearances and a further three goals in the Champions League;[74] this gave him a total of 13 goals halfway through the season, including his strike against Borussia Dortmund in Bayern's win in the 2012 DFL-Supercup. Müller scored his first goal in Bayern's second game back from the break in a 2–0 away win over VfB Stuttgart. Müller tapped in his fifth goal of the Champions League campaign on 2 April, completing a 2–0 first leg defeat of Juventus in the quarter-finals, ending the Italian club's 18-match unbeaten record in Europe.[76] On 23 April 2013, Müller scored two goals and gave one assist in 4–0 win against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final in the Allianz Arena.[77] On the return fixture, Müller scored a header as Bayern won 3–0 and gave Barcelona their biggest defeat ever in the Champions League, with a 7–0 aggregate score.[78] Müller then went on to play an important role in Bayern's 2–1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the final. On 1 June, Müller scored a penalty in the final of the 2012–13 DFB-Pokal.[79] Bayern won the cup 3–2 to complete an historic treble. Müller scored 23 goals overall in the season (including all competitions), netting 13 in the Bundesliga,[80] one in the Pokal,[80] and an impressive eight in the Champions League,[80] he also added one in the 2012 DFL-Supercup which Bayern won 2–1.[81] This topped off Müller's highest scoring season to date.[82]

In Bayern's opening 2013–14 Bundesliga fixture, Müller missed a penalty for the first time. Seconds later, the save from the penalty flicked the hand of Álvaro Domínguez which resulted in another penalty which David Alaba converted. After this, Müller stated, "I am still happy to take penalties, but I think David Alaba is the main man for spot kicks for now." He played in the UEFA Super Cup.[84] On 25 September, against Hannover 96 in the second round of the DFB-Pokal, Müller scored twice taking his cup tally to five goals in just two games.

International career[edit]

Müller with Germany in 2011.

Müller represented Germany at various youth levels, starting with the under-16s in 2004.[125] In August 2009, he was called up to the under-21 team for his debut in a 3–1 friendly defeat against Turkey.[126] He earned six caps for the under-21s and scored one goal,[127] the eighth in an 11–0 thrashing of San Marino.[128]
In October of the same year, Müller's regular appearances for Bayern's first team caused Germany national team manager Joachim Löw to publicly consider him for a call-up,[129][130] despite initial reluctance from the Bayern Munich board;[131] the following month, Müller was named in the squad for a friendly against the Ivory Coast.[132] However, this coincided with the death of national team goalkeeper Robert Enke, which led to the cancellation of a match against Chile the same week.[133] With less opportunity to try out new players, and with the under-21 team facing crucial qualifiers for the 2011 European Championship, Löw and under-21 manager Rainer Adrion felt that Müller was needed at the under-21 level, and Müller was called back into the under-21s.[134]
He was back in the senior squad for its next get-together, a training session in Sindelfingen in January 2010,[135] and was named in the squad for the following match, a friendly against Argentina in March.[136] He made his debut in this game in the starting XI at the Allianz Arena, his home stadium with Bayern. He was substituted in the 66th minute for fellow debutant Toni Kroos as Germany lost 1–0.[137]

Müller was named in Germany's provisional 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players.[138] Despite suffering a scare when he fell off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol,[139] Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final cut for the tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players.[140] He was allocated the number 13,[141] normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack,[141] and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd.[141] He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[142] He started the first game of Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia,[143] winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process.[144] He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16.[145] In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal.[146] However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball[147] and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play.[15] He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals.[148] The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.[149]
With five goals Müller ended as joint top goalscorer of the tournament. He earned the Golden Boot with these goals and his three assists.[150] He also won the Best Young Player Award over fellow nominees André Ayew of Ghana and Giovani dos Santos of Mexico.[151] For both awards, he succeeded a German teammate, Miroslav Klose and Lukas Podolski, respectively, from 2006.[152]
In October 2010, he was named on the shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award along with four of his Germany teammates.[153] Reflecting on his World Cup success, Müller said "I basically got lucky, I hit form at just the right time".[46]
Euro 2012[edit]
Müller started all ten of Germany's qualifiers for Euro 2012, as the team qualified for the finals with a 100% record. Müller provided assists for seven goals,[154] three of which came in a 6–2 win over Austria in September 2011 which secured Germany's qualification for the finals with two games to spare.[155] He scored three times in the campaign, two goals coming in a 4–0 win over Kazakhstan in March 2011,[156] the third in a 3–1 win over Turkey in October of the same year.[157]
Müller was included in Joachim Löw's squad for Euro 2012, where the Germans were knocked out in the semi-finals by Italy.
2014 World Cup[edit]

Müller scored his first World Cup qualifying goals on 22 March 2013, scoring Germany's opener and final goal in a 3–0 away win over Kazakhstan.[158] He also scored in the 3–0 victories over Austria and the Faroe Islands to give him four goals in Germany's successful qualification campaign.
On 16 June 2014, in Germany's opening match of the 2014 World Cup,[159] Müller scored the first hat-trick of the tournament and was named man of the match in a 4–0 win against Portugal.[160] In addition, he was also the target of Pepe's headbutt in the 37th minute, which resulted in the Portuguese defender being sent off.[159][160] He denied that he had "overplayed" the situation leading to the red card.[161] On 26 June, Müller scored the only goal of the final group match against the United States to help the Germans win Group G and dispelled fear of collusion between German coach Joachim Löw and American coach Jürgen Klinsmann to play to a draw as had occurred in 1982.[162]
On 8 July, he scored Germany's opening goal in the 7–1 semi-final defeat of Brazil.[163] This goal was Germany's 2,000th goal in its history. Müller has now scored at least five goals in each of his first two World Cups, making him only the third player to do so (after Teófilo Cubillas and teammate Miroslav Klose).[164] With the goal, he has tied Helmut Rahn with 10 World Cup goals.[164]
On 11 July, Müller was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.[165] Having played a major role in the team's World Cup triumph, Müller received the Silver Boot as the tournament's second top goalscorer with five goals,[5] and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI.[166]
Euro 2016[edit]
Müller featured in nine of ten matches during Germany's qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2016, scoring nine goals as Germany topped their qualifying group to qualify for Euro 2016.[167]
Müller started in all six matches that Germany played at the Euro 2016 finals. In the quarter-final match against Italy,[168] Müller's shot was the first one to be saved in the penalty shoot-out during the tournament.[168] This was the first time Germany failed to score in a shoot out since Uli Stielike missed in the 1982 World Cup.[168] Germany ended up winning the shootout 6–5.[168] Müller's poor run of form throughout the tournament hurt Germany's chances. Eventually, Müller finished the tournament without adding a goal to his name at the Euros.
Style of play[edit]
Müller's role can be described as an attacking all-rounder,[149] a player able to play in a variety of forward positions. As he came through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder,[15] but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more forward roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4-2-3-1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern,[169] and on the right for Germany.[170] He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.[171]
Müller has been praised for his maturity,[172] pace, technique,[173] awareness and positioning.[46] He has been particularly noted for his composure; Germany manager Joachim Löw said he is "impervious to pressure"[15] and former Bayern manager Louis van Gaal said he has tremendous mental strength.[46] A consistent scorer and creator of goals,[174] he describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one-on-ones.[15] Müller describes this role as Raumdeuter,[175] a term that translates to "interpreter of space" (cf. Raumdeuter, "space interpreter"). During 2014 World Cup, Germany manager Joachim Löw stated that Müller "is a very unorthodox player and you can't really predict his lines of running, but he has one aim and that is 'how can I score a goal?".[176]
Personal life[edit]
Müller was born in Weilheim, Upper Bavaria, and grew up in the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media attention during his World Cup exploits.[177] His parents are Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, Simon, who is two and a half years younger.[177] He married his long-time girlfriend Lisa Trede, a semi-professional equestrian who works on a farm,[178] in December 2009 after being engaged for two years.[179] In June 2011, he became an ambassador for YoungWings, a charity that helps children who have suffered bereavement or trauma.[180]

    Thomas Müller (b. 1970 in Munich) is a Berlin-based video artist, experimental musician, painter, and photographer. For an exhibition in 2005, he burned three of his oil paintings and displayed the resulting pile of ashes as a sculpture entitled "three of my favourite pictures". These particular ashes were reused in new paintings, some of which have again been burned to produce further ashes for further paintings. Thus began a cycle of ash-based works entitled "not a bird", ranging from large canvas paintings to postcards, sometimes enriched with pigment. The paintings were used as source material for video installations and exhibitions, or simply burned to produce more ashes. Müller considers the process of burning and the resulting ashes as a means of transcendence and purification. For this reason, he only uses the ashes of objects related to himself. This LP brings together "not a bird" and Müller's long-time preoccupation with Richard Wagner's Rheingold. The piece, originally conceived as a video, consists of countless layers of Rheingold recordings, with side A using the beginning of each recording and side B using the end of each. Side A plays outside-in, side B plays inside-out. The outer and inner sleeves show slightly enlarged facsimiles of four ash-painted postcards.
