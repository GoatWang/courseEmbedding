Following these transactions, PPL shareholders owned 65% of Talen's common stock and affiliates of Riverstone owned 35%.[2] As a condition for FERC approval Talen agreed to divest approximately 1,300 megawatts of generating assets in the PJM Interconnection Region to mitigate FERC's competitiveness concerns.[2] On December 6, 2016, Riverstone Holdings completed the purchase of the remaining 65% of Talen's common stock, making it a privately owned company.[3]

History[edit]
According to the Director of Corporate Communications the name "Talen Energy" symbolizes talent of the people who work for the company and energy in terms of the product it produces and what employees bring to their jobs. Talen "represents the idea of talented people energized to succeed."[4] The company's colors were chosen based on the CEO Paul Farr's love of the Green Bay Packers.[5]
On June 10, 2014, PPL announced that it would spin off its competitive energy business which would merge with Riverstone Holdings' operations to create Talen.[6] The transaction needed approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the FERC, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission before its completion.[7]
On February 2, 2015, PPL and Riverstone accepted the FERC's mitigation option in order to receive approval from FERC.[7] The Pennsylvania PUC approval followed on March 11, 2015 when the PUC approved the transfer of PPL Electric Utilities' ownership in PPL Interstate Energy Company to Talen.[8] The NRC's approval for the transfer of the Susquehanna Nuclear Plant licenses came on April 10, 2015 and on April 23, 2015, PPL received the final regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice.[9][10]
Talen Energy launched on June 1, 2015. PPL shareholders initially owned 65 percent and Riverstone owned 35% of the shares of the new company, whose shares trade on the NYSE under the symbol TLN.[11]
On June 2, 2015, Paul Farr, President and CEO of Talen, and other executives rang the opening bell on the NYSE in celebration of the Talen Energy launch.[12]
On October 8, 2015, Talen announced the sale of Ironwood Natural Gas plant to a TransCanada subsidiary for 654 million USD, and Holtwood and Wallenpaupack Hydro plants to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners of Hamilton, Bermuda for 860 million USD.[13]
Facilities and infrastructure[edit]
Talen owns 15,320 megawatts of power generating capacity, and employs over 500 people in its headquarters in Allentown, as well as 3,000 others at plant locations in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Montana. It is the fourth-largest publicly traded independent power producer in the country.[14]

PPL Corp.'s competitive power generation spinoff Talen Energy Corp. was established Monday, comprising assets that generated $4.3 billion in revenue in 2014.
Talen Energy Corp. (NYSE: TLN) was established June 1, 2015, as one of the largest independent power producers in the United States with a diverse portfolio of generating assets located primarily in the country's two largest competitive electricity markets, a news release states. (Courtesy photo) 
Allentown-based PPL and its partner in the new company, Riverstone Holdings LLC, received final regulatory approval in April to form Talen.
The spinoff doesn't affect rates paid by customers of PPL Electric Utilities, which remains owned by PPL.
Talen's generation mix is 43 percent natural gas or oil, 40 percent coal, 15 percent nuclear and 2 percent hydroelectric.
All told, the company owns about 15,000 megawatts of generating capacity, primarily located in two of the largest, most competitive power markets in the United States: PJM, in the Mid-Atlantic United States, and ERCOT, in Texas.
Talen agreed to sell off about 1,300 megawatts of generating assets in a specific region of PJM under order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
PPL has said it undertook the spinoff with Riverstone in hopes of making both its electric distribution service and the generation side of its business more attractive to investors.
"Talen Energy, a pure-play competitive energy company, will focus on extracting value from our existing portfolio of generating assets, and identifying quality assets in attractive markets that are accretive to cash flow," Paul A. Farr, president and CEO said in a statement. "Our balance sheet and expected asset sale proceeds will enable meaningful execution of our growth plans.
"We have a strong team with the knowledge and experience to generate power safely and reliably, and to create a legacy under the Talen Energy name that benefits our shareholders, employees, and customers," he continued.
Talen's power plants will continue to be operated and maintained by existing staff under PPL and Riverstone.
The new company is based at 835 Hamilton St. in Allentown, under a lease expiring in 2018, Talen spokesman George Lewis said. A decision could be reached as early as this summer on a new, long-term headquarters.
"There's nothing sort of driving the date to make a final decision other than making sure that a developer would have enough time to get something ready for us," Lewis said.

Talen Energy also will continue the wholesale and retail energy sales businesses of PPL EnergyPlus LLC. Current customers of PPL EnergyPlus will see no changes in service, prices or contracts. PPL EnergyPlus will be called Talen Energy Marketing as of Tuesday and will operate under the Talen Energy brand.
Talen Energy will begin trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TLN. Farr and other members of Talen leadership are due to ring the exchange's opening bell at 9:30 a.m.
Talen Energy management will host a conference call and webcast with the financial community at 5 p.m. EDT Monday. During the call, members of the executive team will discuss the new company's business outlook and provide guidance on earnings and cash flow, according to a news release.
The call will be available by dialing 888-317-6003, or online, in audio format, with slides of the presentation at talenenergy.com. The entry number for those calling into the meeting is 0113293. After the meeting, the webcast will be available for replay on the Talen website. International participants should call 1-412-317-6061.

Talen Energy is an independent power producer founded in 2015. It was formed when the competitive power generation business of PPL Corporation was spun off and immediately combined with competitive generation businesses owned by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings. Following these transactions, PPL shareholders owned 65% of Talen's common stock and affiliates of Riverstone owned 35%.[2] As a condition for FERC approval Talen agreed to divest approximately 1,300 megawatts of generating assets in the PJM Interconnection Region to mitigate FERC's competitiveness concerns.[2] On December 6, 2016, Riverstone Holdings completed the purchase of the remaining 65% of Talen's common stock, making it a privately owned company.[3]

History[edit]
According to the Director of Corporate Communications the name "Talen Energy" symbolizes talent of the people who work for the company and energy in terms of the product it produces and what employees bring to their jobs. Talen "represents the idea of talented people energized to succeed."[4] The company's colors were chosen based on the CEO Paul Farr's love of the Green Bay Packers.[5]
On June 10, 2014, PPL announced that it would spin off its competitive energy business which would merge with Riverstone Holdings' operations to create Talen.[6] The transaction needed approval from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the FERC, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission before its completion.[7]
On February 2, 2015, PPL and Riverstone accepted the FERC's mitigation option in order to receive approval from FERC.[7] The Pennsylvania PUC approval followed on March 11, 2015 when the PUC approved the transfer of PPL Electric Utilities' ownership in PPL Interstate Energy Company to Talen.[8] The NRC's approval for the transfer of the Susquehanna Nuclear Plant licenses came on April 10, 2015 and on April 23, 2015, PPL received the final regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice.[9][10]
Talen Energy launched on June 1, 2015. PPL shareholders initially owned 65 percent and Riverstone owned 35% of the shares of the new company, whose shares trade on the NYSE under the symbol TLN.[11]
On June 2, 2015, Paul Farr, President and CEO of Talen, and other executives rang the opening bell on the NYSE in celebration of the Talen Energy launch.[12]
On October 8, 2015, Talen announced the sale of Ironwood Natural Gas plant to a TransCanada subsidiary for 654 million USD, and Holtwood and Wallenpaupack Hydro plants to Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners of Hamilton, Bermuda for 860 million USD.[13]
Facilities and infrastructure[edit]
Talen owns 15,320 megawatts of power generating capacity, and employs over 500 people in its headquarters in Allentown, as well as 3,000 others at plant locations in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Montana. It is the fourth-largest publicly traded independent power producer in the country.[14]

There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

Talen will split from PPL June 1 to be Allentown's newest corporation - The Morning Call





















































FULL COVERAGE: Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski charged in FBI investigation








News 
Nation/World 



Talen Energy launches Monday, sells stock Tuesday








EMILY PAINE, THE MORNING CALL
Talen Energy will make its headquarters at PPL Plaza in Allentown until it settles on a permanent home.

Scott KrausContact ReporterOf The Morning Call

Allentown has Talen now but how long will it stay after Monday's spinoff?




If all goes as planned Monday morning, paperwork will be shuffled, a conference call linking executives at multiple locations will conclude, and Allentown will gain a new corporate heavyweight.The only outward indicators will be a new sign on PPL Plaza announcing the building's primary occupant now goes by the name Talen Energy, and the green and yellow Talen stickers over the PPL logo on the badges of Talen's 500 downtown Allentown employees.On Tuesday, Talen's new CEO, Paul Farr, will ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange as the company's shares, trading under the symbol TLN, go on sale to the public a little over a year after PPL announced it would be spinning off its power generation and marketing business."It will be a real tangible sign we are a separate company, we are up and running and off on our own," said PPL spokesman George C. Lewis, one of the 500 employees.The business impact of the deal is significant, converting a giant energy-generating, utility-operating behemoth into two large but distinct businesses.PPL Corp. will become exclusively an operator of regulated utilities, delivering power to customers in Pennsylvania and Kentucky and overseeing a large chunk of the power grid in the United Kingdom through its Western Power Distribution division.The new kid on the 800 block of Hamilton Street, Talen Energy, will be strictly a power producer, selling an estimated 14,000 megawatts of energy capacity from 11 former PPL-owned power plants and 13 former Riverstone Holdings plants to utility and business customers.Talen Energy will have 3,500 employees, most of them manning 24 power plants in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Montana.

At birth, the company will be the nation's fourth-largest publicly traded independent power producer. Its stock is expected to be a component of the S&P MidCap 400 index.PPL shareholders will get a stake in the new company, receiving roughly one share of Talen Energy stock for every eight shares of PPL stock they hold.PPL Corp. will be left with about 13,000 employees, mostly in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Great Britain.To give a sense of scale, PPL reported $11.5 billion in revenue in 2014, about a third of which came from the supply segment that is being spun off and combined with the Riverstone Holdings' power plants to create Talen Energy. In an investor note, Deutsche Bank estimated Talen's annual operating revenue for 2015 at about $3.2 billion.Wall Street analysts expect Talen, which will have a relatively low debt load, to grow quickly by looking at acquisitions, a key to the company's long-term prospects.Potential targets include selected power plant assets of Chicago-based AEP Energy and New Orleans-based Entergy, according to a report by Deutsche Bank analysts Abe Azar and Jonathan Arnold.How they achieve that is unclear, although Talen executives will hold a conference call Monday to outline future plans, wrote Evercore ISI analysts Greg Gordon and Igor Gitelman in an analysis of the company's newly offered stock."They will be competing with private equity firms and other independent power producers for acquisitions," the Evercore analysts wrote.Another big question for Talen is: Where will the company settle down?The employees and the state taxes spun off by Talen's power production and marketing activities are critical to Allentown's downtown revitalization, helping to pay off the bonds floated to finance construction of the PPL Center arena."We are doing everything we can to work with the state to make sure they remain in the Lehigh Valley and specifically in Allentown," said Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski. "It's not every day a new Fortune 500 company is birthed in the city of Allentown or any city our size. We are very proud."Talen is expected to remain at PPL Plaza until 2018, when its lease ends. Allentown officials have been pushing hard to keep the company in the city's special Neighborhood Improvement Zone, but no decisions have been announced on where it will eventually land.It has pledged to remain in the Lehigh Valley but recently said that would allow a relocation to Phillipsburg, which is part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area.There's no target date for a decision, Lewis said."We will have to give a developer enough time to either build or fit out a building."scott.kraus@mcall.comTwitter @skraus610-820-6745ABOUT TALENCEO: Paul FarrHeadquarters: AllentownEmployees: 3,500Stock symbol: TLNBusiness: Power generation, marketing

Talen Energy debuts as one of largest U.S. independent power producers
 


 

 




 





 


ALLENTOWN, Pa., June 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Talen Energy Corporation (NYSE:   TLN) was established today, as one of the largest independent power producers in the United States with a diverse portfolio of generating assets located primarily in the country's two largest competitive electricity markets.
Talen Energy was formed when the competitive power generation business of PPL Corporation (NYSE:   PPL) was spun off and immediately combined with the competitive generation business owned by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings, LLC. Upon completion of these transactions, PPL shareholders owned 65 percent of Talen Energy's common stock; affiliates of Riverstone owned 35 percent.
Paul A. Farr, President and Chief Executive Officer, leads an experienced Talen Energy management team that has decades of experience in power generation, commercial operations and corporate strategy.
"The combination with Riverstone was the first step in Talen Energy's growth plans," Farr said.
"Talen Energy, a pure-play competitive energy company, will focus on extracting value from our existing portfolio of generating assets, and identifying quality assets in attractive markets that are accretive to cash flow. Our balance sheet and expected asset sale proceeds will enable meaningful execution of our growth plans," he said.
"We have a strong team with the knowledge and experience to generate power safely and reliably, and to create a legacy under the Talen Energy name that benefits our shareholders, employees, and customers," he said.
At closing, Talen Energy owns about 15,000 megawatts of generating capacity, primarily located in two of the largest, most transparent and most liquid competitive power markets in the United States: PJM (Mid-Atlantic) and ERCOT (Texas). Talen Energy has agreed to divest approximately 1,300 megawatts of generating assets in a specific region of PJM under a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order.
With carbon-free nuclear power, clean and flexibly dispatched natural gas generation, and efficient coal-fired generation, Talen Energy already has the scale and asset diversity to be one of the leading companies in the competitive energy and power generation sector.
On a pro-forma basis, the assets comprising Talen Energy generated annual revenue of $4.3 billion in 2014.
The generation mix is about 43 percent natural gas or oil, 40 percent coal, 15 percent nuclear and 2 percent hydro.
Experienced Leadership Team
Members of the leadership team average nearly 30 years of experience in energy and power generation. Farr previously served as President of PPL Energy Supply, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of PPL Corporation, Senior Vice President-Financial and Controller of PPL Corporation, and Chief Operating Officer of PPL Global.
Jeremy R. McGuire, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has 20 years of financing and strategic advisory experience. He led the Strategic Planning function at PPL Corporation for the past seven years. Before joining PPL in 2008, he was an investment banker at Lehman Brothers, where he worked with regulated utilities, independent power producers and private equity clients.
Farr and McGuire were instrumental in the acquisition and financing of $14 billion in utility businesses that transformed PPL and provided it a more stable platform for growth, as well as divestitures of non-core PPL assets totaling about $1.4 billion.
Clarence J. Hopf Jr., Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, has more than 30 years of experience in power generation and energy marketing. Timothy S. Rausch, Senior Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer, has 25 years of experience in virtually all disciplines of the nuclear power industry.
Talen Energy Operations
Talen Energy's generating plants will continue to be operated and maintained by the experienced professionals who operated and maintained them safely and efficiently under PPL and Riverstone.
Talen Energy also will continue the wholesale and retail energy sales businesses of PPL EnergyPlus, LLC. Current customers of PPL EnergyPlus will see no changes in service, prices or contracts. PPL EnergyPlus will be called Talen Energy Marketing as of June 2 and will operate under the Talen Energy brand.
Stock Symbol and Logo
Talen Energy will begin regular-way trading June 2 on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TLN. Farr and other members of Talen Energy leadership will ring the Exchange's opening bell at 9:30 a.m.
The new company also unveiled its logo, designed to portray the movement and feel of energy through its typeface and green and yellow color scheme. The logo is available at www.talenenergy.com.
Investment Community Conference Call
As announced on May 26, Talen Energy management will host a conference call and webcast with the financial community on June 1 at 5 p.m. During the call, members of the executive team will discuss the new company's business outlook and provide guidance on earnings and cash flow.
The call will be available by dialing 1-888-317-6003, or online, in audio format, with slides of the presentation at www.talenenergy.com. The entry number for those calling into the meeting is 0113293. After the meeting, the webcast will be available for replay on the Talen Energy website. International participants should call 1-412-317-6061.
