You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

We offer storage solutions for just about anything imaginable. So whether you're looking to make more room in your home or extend your office space, we have the right unit for your needs. We can even park motorcycles, cars, boats, RVs — or anything else you can think of!






Unit Sizes
Our standard sizes range from 5'x5' to 10‘x30' and our units are about 8 feet high.† Many facilities also offer smaller or larger spaces – everything from storage lockers to garage-like units. Try our 
                                                                    Size Guide. and you're sure to walk away with a good understanding of the unit type and size that's right for you.



Climate-Controlled Units
Most locations offer climate-controlled units that have the benefit of maintaining a set temperature range. Be sure to select this unit type when your storage requires protection from extreme hot and cold environments.
Drive-Up Units
With their own spacious loading area and large roll-up doors much like a garage, these units are an excellent choice for overall convenience and frequent "stow and go's."
Indoor vs. Outdoor Units
Indoor units are located within our building, accessible by wide hallways, and can often be above ground level with elevator access. They offer protection from outdoor elements and can be climate-controlled. Outdoor units are at ground level and offer drive-up access with roll-up doors. Their interior temperatures are often similar to local weather conditions.








†Actual unit sizes may vary from approximate size estimate. Please inspect any unit before renting.
















Prices vary based on location and the unit features selected. We often provide online discounts and other special offers, so please refer to the quoted price shown when making your reservation.





Find Storage Now















Pay Just $1 For The First Month's Rent*
For most units you'll pay just $1 for the first month's rent*. That's our way of saying thank you and welcome to Public Storage.
Other Charges
You may also choose to purchase a lock, insurance, or moving supplies. These additional items—as well as any taxes and a nominal one-time administrative fee—will be included in your first payment.


Offers and Discounts
When you make your reservation online, you'll always get our best discount and lowest price for your unit. Occasionally, we provide other offers and discounts for both new and existing customers, so be sure to check back often. 
Lease Terms
At Public Storage, we use only month-to-month leases. This means you get to decide how long you stay, and you can move out at any time without the hassle of long-term commitments.

























Reserving your unit is always free. And fast! Just submit your online reservation now to secure a space and lock in the savings with a discounted price. Or, if you have any questions, call a reservation specialist at 1-800-688-8057. You can even stop by any Public Storage location to reserve in person.
















What it Means to Reserve
When you reserve a unit, we hold the selected unit size, price and promotion for you until you're ready to move in. For your convenience, you can make your reservation up to 7 days in advance of your move-in date (depending on the location, this timeframe can vary). Reserve one unit, or as many as you need. There's no obligation and you can change or cancel your reservation at any time.
No Obligation
There's absolutely no cost when making your reservation, and we never ask for a credit card. Should you later decide you're not quite ready for storage, no further action is necessary.
What's Needed to Reserve
The only information we ask for is your name, email address and telephone number.
Changes and Cancellations
You can make unit size and location changes at any time by managing your reservation online. Change your move-in date if you need more time to pack, or cancel your reservation and start over again when you're ready. It's always in your control, and it's always free.



After reserving a unit, you will receive a confirmation email showing your reservation details. Your property manager will also call to confirm your reservation and answer any questions you may have. To learn more about your move-in day and what to expect next, be sure to visit Moving In.
