About

Bio – Derek Weaver  Born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, Derek Weaver grew up watching his dad ride Bobbers and Triumphs.  At age six, he wrote Santa for a mini-chopper. In 1969 Derek lost his dad in an auto accident with a drunk driver.  Derek's mother remarried Ken Thompson who was an avid car enthusiast and owned his own automotive equipment business.  Ken bought Derek and his brother Mack a pair of Suzuki 50 mini-bikes and later moved them up to Suzuki 125 dirt bikes.  Derek's passion for cars along with Ken's knowledge of the automotive industry drove his interest in working at his stepfather’s business.  Ken was the factory representative for FMC Corporation's automotive service equipment division (currently owned by Snap-On Tools and marketed as John Bean).  Starting in 1977 at the age of 15, Derek began working at Ken's equipment business in Fort Worth, Texas servicing everything from car lifts to tire changers.  Ken Thompson Company was responsible for the sales and service of wheel alignment equipment, computer wheel balancing, brake lathes, engine analyzers, tire changers, and automotive lifts for Oklahoma and most of Texas.  One of Derek's first tasks was to rebuild and caibrate the popular John Bean Visualiner optical wheel alignment system.

In 1947, the John Bean Visualiner became the first optically based alignment system in the world and quickly became the standard of the industry through the 70's.

In 1967, Ken Thompson (left) in his Oklahoma Showroom/Training Center.   By 1980, Derek had served as a factory certified service technician for both FMC Corporation and Ken Thompson Company.  In 1982, Derek lost his brother Mack in a motorcycle accident when an elderly man turned left in front of him.  Derek was married in 1983 and was also appointed to the position of service manager as well as equipment sales manager. 

1982 Ken Thompson with Derek Weaver (age 20) in Paris at the Arc de Triomphe due Carrousel. On this trip, Derek & Ken attended Automechanika in Germany along with the rest of the Group 10 company. From this trip, the group acquired the rights to import the first asymmetric car lifts to the USA. The asymmetric design was an instant hit and continues to be the dominant feature of most car lifts sold today.

In 1984, at the age of 22, Derek was signed as the factory sales and service representative for FMC Corporation in Texas.  This marked the beginning of Derek Weaver Company and Ken's move into the emerging above-ground car lift industry.  During the next five years Derek successfully ran the Texas territory for FMC Corporation, selling and servicing wheel balancers, tire changers and car lifts to various local distributors and national accounts including Wal-Mart, Goodyear, Pep-Boys, Exxon, General Motors, Chrysler, Ford, Nissan, Western Auto, Auto Zone and many more.
 
1989 marked a move away from being a factory representative for FMC and into the distribution business.  Derek Weaver Company has distributed products for FMC, Coats, Ammco, Rotary Lifts, Snap-On Tools, Hofmann, Hunter, RTI, Forward Lifts, Nussbaum Lifts, Beissbarth, John Bean, Autoscan, Benwil Lifts, Grand, Norco, Lisle, Ace Tool, Alltest, VBM Lifts, Challenger Lifts and many others.  In 1999 Derek founded the Direct-Lift brand.  In 2002, Derek partnered with Ken Thompson to cofound the Direct-Lift marketing concepts.  Direct-Lift began as a division of Derek Weaver Co., Inc. and was based on Derek and Ken's marketing strategies.  Later in 2002, Eric Shen and John Chang became manufacturing partners with Derek and Ken in an effort to grow the product line.  Derek not only is the founding member of Direct-Lift but also operates the Direct-Lift sales and distribution warehouse in both Fort Worth, Texas and Thomasville, North Carolina.
  By 2005, Direct-Lift became the largest U.S. supplier of lifts to the hobbyist/enthusiasts industry.  By utilizing their volume manufacturing in an ISO 9001-certified plant, Direct-Lift has been able to deliver high-quality products at direct prices.  Direct-Lift's unique marketing approach has given the buyer the most cost-effective way to buy a quality lift.  Rotary Lift Consolidated/VSG subsidary of Dover Corp. (NYSE: DOV)  acquired Direct-Lift in 2007 and is now a valuable team member of the largest lift company in the world.
Derek founded The Weaver Lift brand in 2008.  The Weaver Lift brand began with an "Ok" from past Rotary Lift / Dover VP John Podczerwinski, to use the Weaver Lift brand.  The original Weaver Lift brand had belonged to Rotary Lift when they purchased the assets of the Weaver Lift division of Weaver MFG. Co., (incorporated in 1910) in 1989.  The brand was discontinued by Rotary Lift until it was reborn nearly 20 years later.  The Weaver Lift brand is currently used to label only carefully selected products from industry leading quality manufacturers.       

2017 marks the 33rd Anniversary of Derek Weaver Company, Inc. and the 40th year of Derek's experience in the automotive industry. A passion to compete and a desire to serve the customer before, during and after the sale have been instrumental to Derek's success and longevity.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 20, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rush Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:RUSHA) (Nasdaq:RUSHB), which operates the largest network of commercial vehicle dealerships in North America, today announced the promotions of Steven L. Keller to Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and Derrek Weaver to Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. The Company also appointed Corey Lowe to the newly created position of Senior Vice President of Peterbilt Dealerships. The promotions take effect immediately and all three executives will report to W. M. "Rusty" Rush, President and Chief 
Executive Officer of Rush Enterprises, Inc.

Steven L. Keller has served as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company since 2007. Mr. Keller has been intimately involved in the Company's finance and accounting functions since 1997 and will maintain responsibility for financial analysis and planning, business acquisitions, SEC reporting, investor relations and corporate taxes.  Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Keller, a Certified Public Accountant, worked in the San Antonio office of Ernst & Young L.L.P.  

Derrek Weaver has served as Vice President and General Counsel of the Company since 2010. Mr. Weaver remains responsible for overseeing the Company's legal department, general corporate governance matters and the legal aspects of business acquisitions and SEC reporting. Mr. Weaver served as the Company's Vice President of Legal Affairs and Chief Compliance Officer from February 2005, when he joined the Company, until 2010. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Weaver was an Associate Attorney at Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P. in San Antonio, Texas, where he assisted the Company with acquisitions, SEC reporting and corporate governance matters beginning in 2002. 


 "Both Steve and Derrek are outstanding professionals in their fields and have been instrumental in the Company's ability to accomplish key growth initiatives including recent major business acquisitions," said W.M. "Rusty" Rush.  "Their continued leadership will no doubt benefit the Rush organization and contribute significantly to the Company's success in the future."

Corey Lowe has been appointed to the newly created position of Senior Vice President of Peterbilt Dealerships and will be responsible for overall dealership operations of the Company's Peterbilt Division. Mr. Lowe joined Rush in 1998 and has served as Regional Manager for the Company's North Texas, Oklahoma and Tennessee dealerships since 2008, Regional General Manager for Rush Truck Centers in Oklahoma from 2006 to 2008 and General Manager of the Company's Oklahoma City dealership from 2003 to 2006. 


 "I am pleased to name Corey Lowe to this new position. Corey has spent his entire career in the Rush Truck Centers dealership organization, and I am confident his expert knowledge of both the Peterbilt product line and dealership operations will contribute greatly to his success in this new role," said W.M. "Rusty" Rush. 


 Mr. Lowe will be a part of the senior management team of the Company's Peterbilt Division, which also includes David C. Orf, Senior Vice President of Marketing, Fleets and Specialized Equipment Sales, James E. Thor, Senior Vice President, Retail Sales and Daryl J. Gorup, Senior Vice President of Dealership Operations.   All four executives will work together to ensure the continued success of the Company. 


 "I am excited about these organizational changes, which I believe will allow me more time to focus on implementing the Company's strategies for growth, while still remaining involved in our operations," concluded W.M. "Rusty" Rush.
