 Forgotten Pleasures -- Nesselrode Pie •The Domestic FrontForgotten Pleasures -- Nesselrode Pie •The Domestic Front       Forgotten Pleasures — Nesselrode Pie   Last Minute Gift -- Pecan Brittle Have a VERY merry Christmas -- Bourbon Balls I don’t know if I have an old fashioned palate, or if it’s my inner historian, or if I’m just plain curious, but whenever I hear about a recipe or a dish that is extinct my mouth starts watering. I love poring through old cookbooks and finding recipes for foods that you just don’t see today — prune whip, creamed chipped beef, blancmange, Welsh rabbit. But this particular forgotten dish — Nesselrode Pie — piqued my interest like no other. If you’ve been reading this blog over the past few weeks, you may have noticed that I am drawn to holiday recipes that feature booze or candied fruit peel or chocolate, so when I heard about Nesselrode Pie — a cream pie flavored with rum and candied peel and garnished with chocolate — I pretty much thought that I may have found the ultimate holiday dessert. Traditionally, Nesselrode (named after Count Karl Nesselrode, a 19th century Russian diplomat) featured candied chestnuts or chestnut puree (also traditional to the holidays) but for whatever reason (probably largely related to the shocking labor and therefore expense associated with candying chestnuts), Nesselrode Pie, which was popular in New York in the 1940’s and 1950’s, became associated with candied fruits (no chestnuts) and rum. Most of the recipes I could find featured a product called “Nesselro”, which contained candied fruits (including cauliflower, which supposedly mimicked the texture of chestnuts) in a rum flavored syrup, which I though I had tracked down a few years ago at the Vermont Country Store but which sadly seems to be unobtainable. Instead, I scoured the internet for recipes and combined them into one I thought would be a decadent holiday pie and an excellent alternative to the pumpkin and pecan you see this time of year. I can’t promise that it’s authentic — I’ve never tasted another Nesselrode Pie. But I can say that when my mom tasted it she said “This tastes like my childhood.” And I can promise that if rum and fruit and chocolate float your boat, this will be the holiday pie for you.4.7 from 3 reviewsNesselrode Pie Author:Kate WheelerServes: 8Prep time: 25 minsCook time: 15 minsTotal time: 40 mins Print IngredientsFor crumb crust:1½ c. chocolate cookie crumbs (I used Trader Joe's chocolate cat cookies)2 T sugar½ c. butterFor the filling:½ cup finely diced candied fruit (I used red and green pineapple for color and texture and candied orange peel)⅓ cup rum1½ c. heavy cream, divided into ¾ c. and ¾ c.3 egg yolks2 T sugar1 tablespoon gelatin⅓ cup cold water½ c. sweetened chestnut puree1 teaspoon vanilla3 egg whites, beaten until stiffInstructionsFor crumb crust:Process sugar and crumbs in food processor.Melt butter, combine with sugar and crumbs.Press into a 9 inch pie plate until firm (I use the bottom of a glass to press it in.Bake at 325 degrees for about 15 minutes, let cool.For the filling:Pour rum over the fruits, let macerate for at least one hour.Bring ¾ c. cream to a simmer. Beat egg yolks with sugar until pale yellow. Whisk in part of the hot cream, then return the eggs to the remainder of the cream and whisk over low heat until the mixture is thickened. Fold in chestnut puree.Meanwhile, sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water in a small bowl. When the gelatin has absorbed the water and the custard is thickened, whisk the gelatin into the cream and eggs mixture. Refrigerate until firm.Break up the firmed custard with some vigorous stirring. Beat the egg whites until stiff and whip the remaining cream. Fold the macerated fruits (with the rum), the whipped cream and the beaten egg whites into the chestnut custard mixture. Pour into the prepared pie shell.Chill until firm, and garnish with curls of chocolate.3.2.2802  Did you enjoy this post?Signup now to receive weekly emails with new content.

Looks good!  Lauren December 18, 2009  What a lovely little pie!  I’ve never heard of Nesselrode before =D.  Katie B December 18, 2009  Hey!http://www.ultimate-gourmet.com/ProductDetails.asp?brand=Raffetto&type=Fruit%20Toppings&name=Nesslro%20Fruit%20ToppingBoom. Apparently in stock.I’m torn about this pie. I don’t really like eggy, custardy desserts (e.g. flan, anything featuring meringue, those Dutch baby-style sweet breakfast omelets), but the forgotten favorite holds a powerful appeal for me. Would I be able to deal w/ the eggs, do you think? (I can and do eat creme brulee and tiramisu…)  Jason martin July 2, 2016  My family made the pie originally it a family recipe I am a desendant of Ada nesslerott my grandmall  Kate @ The Domestic Front December 18, 2009  Katie —You are a true web sleuth.  However, even though I am quite fond of Nesselrode Pie, I’m not sure I’m 12 jars of Nesselro fond.Because of the whipped cream, this is definitely more on the creamy side than the eggy side, plus the rum and chestnuts cover up that egg flavor.  But it is a cream pie, which means it is custard based.  Suz Lipman December 19, 2009  I once referenced Nesselrode Pie in a fiction piece! I loved the old-fashioned ring to it. It’s great to really learn its history. Thanks for tracking down its origins and ingredients.  chris December 20, 2009  Welsh rarebit – not rabbit!  There’s no rabbit involved!  Kate December 20, 2009  Ha Chris — I know there’s no rabbit involved.  It’s actually a big debate which one is correct — the story I’ve heard (and which sounds entirely plausible to me) is that Welsh Rabbit is a pejorative term for the dish invented by the English that’s intended to comment on the poverty of the Welsh.  I’ve heard yeas and nays on both sides, but that’s the story I’m sticking to so I call it rabbit!  disneypal December 21, 2009  How funny you would post this – your timing is perfect for me!  I recently saw an episode of Andy Griffith and they were talking about this pie, I heard it was in the Mayberry cookbook so I sought it out (lots of great recipes in that book BTW).  I just bought the ingredients to make it – it is very similar to your only the crust is a traditional crust not a chocolate crumb crust.  I also am interested in long forgotten recipes.  Apparently this was quite a popular pie for a while and then it just kind of disappeared.  Gourmet Mama December 28, 2009  This sounds fascinating . . . . now I want to make it! I love old recipes myself. In fact, I grew up with quite a few, including the Welsh Rarebit/Rabbit, which my mother used to make us for lunch. Since I’m half Welsh, I always thought it rather appropriate. 😀  Michael Pheneger March 31, 2010  This is so great! Driving home this evening I remarked to my wife “what is nesselroad pie?”.  For some reason I thought about that pie from my childhood.  I googled this and was directed here.  I looked at the recipe and sure enough those memories started comeing back.  As a practicing chef, I eal with food daily in a large hotel.  I could almost taste the flavors of this recipe and can hardly wait to make it on my upcoming vacation the week after Easter. Happy cooking everyone.  Karl October 2, 2010  There was a bakery called Sttuers French Pastries in Brooklyn, Greenwich Village and somewhere in Queens which produced an absolutely perfect Nesselrode pie.  It’s neither flan-like or eggy and for years I’ve been looking for a bakery which would attempt to replicate my memories.  Unfortunately, Sutters has been out of business for years and the last place I had a slice was Sweets, a fish restaurant down by the South Street Seaport.  At one time this pie was so ubiquitous in NYC that you could get it at any Horn & Hardardt automat.If anyone locates a source for the finished pie, please post it.  Karl October 2, 2010  Sorry, it’s Sutters, not stutters.  Mrs.57 November 21, 2010  With all respect, this recipe is outta whack. Arthur Schwartz aka The Food Maven has been into food for half a century and has the most authentic recipe online, cut &paste http://www.thefoodmaven.com/radiorecipes/nesselrode.html Chestnut puree makes the mushy outcome pictured. You can substitute candied fruits, even just candied orange peel. I usually soak the fruits in rum for a couple of days, a third cup of raw rum is too overpowering in what should be a custard and cream filling. The crust should be a plain fluted and flaky butter crust, pre baked.  Karl November 21, 2010  Actually, a graham cracker crust is perfect for this dessert.  Mrs.57 November 22, 2010  I sent Kate a lazy version of Nesselrode pie…it may lack culinary standards but in this age of non-existent rum soaked chestnuts, it serves us well. Karl consider an Oreo chocolate cookie crust.  Karl November 22, 2010  Oreo cookies?  Sacre Bleu!  The Count must be turning over in his grave.  Mrs.57 November 22, 2010  Mon Dieu! not w/the oreo cream, the cookie crust comes prepackaged, like the graham cracker one. I’ve embarrassed sweet Kate enuf, so let me wish you all a wonderful Nesselrode-less happy Thanksgiving, I caved…doing a homemade ‘pumpkin pie & baked apples.  martyg January 3, 2011  just scanning the net and found the nesselrode comments and it brought back memories.  i’ve eaten it many times.  hortense spier made it and sold it to many places including peter lugers in brooklyn.  she made wonderful desserts and for me it was a tough decision between the nesselrode and the blueberry crumb.  this bit of nostalgia has disappeared,  unfortunately.  there was a bakery in brooklyn, on morgan avenue,  that continued to make them for quite a while.  the name escapes me.  i guess it’s hostess twinkies now.  D Brophy January 5, 2011  My mother used to make my favorite pie of all time….the nesselrode.  This was through the 50’s and 60’s and I believe she used 2 layers of bavarian cream (rum flavored)covered with unsweetened chocolate shavings.  She always said that it was not a true nesselrode pie but it was delicious.  The added benefit may be that you don’t have to find the Nesselro.  LadyChef March 6, 2011  Great to see this old recipe revived!   Madeleine Kamman mentions Nesselrode in her books (and she did fold chestnut puree into the bavaroise), but most of the boomer generation rejected anything that resembled  fruitcake (shudder).Browsing through my professional library;  in his 1960 edition of The Baker’s Manual for Quantity Baking, Joseph Amendola gives this version of Nesselrode to use in his pie:  “Soak together: 2 ounces each of cherries, pineapple and raisins; 3 ounces of chestnuts and 1 ounce of rum.”  The mixture is folded into the filling at the end.  No chocolate.  He puts his filling in a regular pre-baked pie shell.  Baker February 26, 2012  My new Pie Country bakery has received a number of special requests for Nesselrode Pie, so with a little research, we have been making a delicious Nesselrode Pie for special orders. Not a fan of candied citron, we use marons glacee chopped up along with just enough chestnut puree to give it good flavor without making it too heavy. And we nestle it all in our classic butter crust, top it with fresh whipped cream and lots of bittersweet chocolate shavings.  Karl March 1, 2012  Where are your locations?  Baker March 2, 2012  We are based in the Bronx, though do not currently have a store-front. We do wholesale baking and a small online retail for special local delivery.  JimBoerger July 18, 2012  A couple ran the cafeteria where I worked years ago. He was the manager and she was the cook and made the best pies ever. One was the Neselrode. Ihave made it many times and is much simpler than described here. Mine is: ican evaporated milk. one cup of milk, 3 egg yolks, i/4 cup corn starch and 1 cup sugar. Beat thoroughly and cook over medium heat, stiring constantly till mixture thickens. Remove from heat and stir i 3tbs butter and 1 tsp. vanilla Then stir in 1/2 cup chopped dates ans 1/2 cup candied cherrries quartered and 14 cup sliverered almons. Pour into a baked pie shell. I either top it with merangue or shaved chocoolate. Either is to die for.  Marleen November 21, 2012  I remember Nesselrode Pie very well and with affection.  Gage and Tollner in downtown Brooklyn, N.Y. in the 1950’s and 60’s served it.  It was certainly beautiful, however it was a “heart attack” on a plate.  It probably was wiped-out with the search for good for you foods, a real loss.  Ann January 6, 2013  I have a friend who makes nesselrode sauce for ice cream, pound cake and whatever else.  She loves it.  Do you have any history or information about a nesselrode sauce?  DougInCal July 4, 2013  A cable station called ME TV is running That Girl, Marlo Thomas’s sitcom from the 60’s. This week she played a waitress in a private club for gangsters, and for their banquet’s dessert she served “the boys” individual Nesselrode Pies. You could see whip cream and chocolate bits on their tops. This was circa 1965.  Kate July 9, 2013  It’s definitely a retro dessert!  Maybe it will come back into fashion!  Rita July 9, 2013  I remember nesselrode pie very well from the 50’s and 60’s.  We enjoyed it many times at Ratner’s Dairy Restaurant on Delancey Street in the lower east side of manhattan.  Delicious!  Kate July 10, 2013  I love to hear stories like this.  If you try the recipe, tell me how the taste compares!  Inez Edmundson September 13, 2013  I saw an episode of the Andy Griffith Show and Aunt Bee made this pie  Noel October 16, 2013  Found this pie in Betty Crocker’s Cookbook. No copyright still inside, but I would guess mid 70’s. I am 42 and don’t remember my Mom’s kitchen without it.  Kate October 16, 2013  I’ll have to look through some of my vintage cookbooks!  Sue December 18, 2013  My Mom made Nesselrode Pie every year at Christmas time. She used the same candied fruit she used in her fruit cakes, and made the crust of ground Brazil nuts, butter and sugar. She said it became popular after the end of rationing after WWII, because it perfectly expressed the decadent treats that had been denied during the war. Thanks for bringing it back!  Bobbi September 2, 2014  I was actually looking for a Nesslerode Pie recipe when I found this one. I made one once when I was a young married woman in the late 60’s. Found my reicipe in a womans magazine at the time and can’t remember which one. What I do remember is that the recipe was very labor intensive, but turned out sooo delicious. I remember shaving the chocolate curls for the top, but not sure about the crust, though pretty sure it was chocolate. It was amazing but I never made it again. Just had a longing to find it and try it again and I appreciate all your research,effort, and enthusiasm. It looks wonderful and I hope to make on these next holidays.  KAREN CUSHING April 1, 2015  I GREW UP WITH MY MOTHER MAKING THIS NESSELRODE PIE.  THE STORY WAS THAT SHE AND MY DAD WERE IN N.Y.C. AND HAD IT AT A RESTURANT IN THE 30’S OR 40’S.  SHE BEGGED THE WAITER FOR THE RECIPE AND HE GAVE IT TO HER!  I HAVE BEEN MAKING IT ONLY AT CHRISTMAS TIME FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS.2 PASTRY SHELLS…COOKED SEPARATE 3 EGGS. COMBINE THE SLIGTHLY BEATEN EGG YOLKS WITH 1 1/2 CUPS OF WHOLE MILK, 1/4 TEASPOON SALT AND 1/3 CUP OF SUGAR IN THE TOP OF A DOUBLE BOILER.  COOK OVER SIMMERING WATER UNTIL THE MIXTURE THICKENS AND COATS A SPOON.  STIR CONSTANTLY. SOFTEN ONE ENVELOPE OF GELATIN IN 1 TABLESPOON OF COOL WATER AND WHISK INTO THE HOT MIXTUREUNTIL GELATIN DISSOLVES.  CHILL THE MIXTURE IN REFRIGERATOR UNTIL MIXTURE BEGINS TO THICKEN. BEAT THE 3 EGG WHITES UNTIL STIFF WHILE GRADUALLY ADDING 1/3 SUGAR. FOLD THE EGG WHITES INTO THE THICKENING (BUT NOT SET) EGG MIXTURE. ADD 2 TABLESPOONS OF RUM FLAVORING AND 1/4 CUP CHOPPED MARACHINO CHERRIES.  MIX GENTLY.  DIVIDE AND POUR INTO THE 2 COOKED PIE CRUSTS. SPRINKLE WITH 2 TABLESPOONS SHAVED UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE. REFRIGERATE AND SERVE AFTER THE FILLING IS SET.  Corinne Mahaffy November 19, 2015  Thank you, thank you Kate for your wonderful site “The Domestic Front”.  Trying to get to sleep last night I suddenly tasted nesselrode.  What a memory from the past.  My family love Christmas Pudding, and at 83 I am tired of the same old, same old.  I had turned the pudding bowls over to the kids, but 2 years ago they were dumped back on me with a plea to make the puddings, as they were too busy!  So much for retirement.  Well, I made the Christmas pudding, but after reading all about nesselrode on the internet today I have decided to make the nesselrode custard, but put it in a pavlova (meringue) crust which I will make during Christmas week, and combine the two just before serving, perhaps mounded with more whipping cream.  To heck with the fat and sugar — it is just one day!  Wish me luck — and thanks again for renewing this memory.  Kate TDF November 19, 2015  Corinne, Thanks for the lovely note!  Your pie sounds fabulous!  And I’m with you on an indulgent holiday.  We are also pudding-eaters in our family – Christmas dinner always features a steamed Christmas pudding made with persimmons, which I may one day share on the site!  Happiest of holidays.  Gerald Robbins December 24, 2015  This brings back wonderful memories from my high school years in the early 1960’s. My very first girl friend, was my  high school sweetheart in Hollywood. Her dear mom (who sadly passed away, this year) made this incredibly delicious Nesselrode pie when I was invited as a dinner guest, on a few occasions. It was simply an unforgettable, incredibly delicious taste experience. No one in my dear friend’s family except her mom knew the origins of this pie recipe. Today, I just was in touch with my old friend and she told me that she still has her mother’s recipe for Nesselrode pie and promises to share it with me by sending it as she did so long ago when, sadly I had lost it. I read to her, today, the history of the pie and of the Russian diplomat Karl Nesselrode, a German Jewish soldier who was working in the court of Emperor Alexander I in the early 1820’s. Nesselrode’s chief chef invented the pie in honor of Nesselrode and his service to Russia, and named the pie after the diplomat. I shared this information with my friend who found it extremely fascinating, and she then surmised that, perhaps, her mother also knew the historic origin of Nesselrode pie. Thank you for sharing this forgotten recipe.  T.R. January 28, 2016  This pie originally called for chestnut puree to be added to the cream filling.   American chestnut trees were totally killed out by a “blight” that went through this country many years ago.  Most Americans today have never heard of chestnuts or even seen them unless they have traveled to Europe.  You could buy fresh hot roasted chestnuts from street vendors in very big cities back in the 1950’s in northeastern states.  Anyway the death of the American chestnut caused the death of the true Nesselrode pie.  Kate TDF January 28, 2016  Thanks for the note TR!  I know that chestnut trees are rare in America.  lulu September 20, 2016  Love this recjpe, these comments.  So funny how I found this, lol, as often happens on internet.  I started by looking up Ansonia Station, in NYC.  Something i am mailing goes there.  Then I read about the Ansonia, and saw their menu from 1907.  I had never heard about this pie, but will ask Brooklyn born Dad about it.  Would love to try baking it at Christmas.  Cheers! https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ansonia –    orher interesting items on menu, of course!!  lulu September 20, 2016  I am not finding the menu source…hmmm…i know nypl has it…i remember smelling roasted chesnuts in NYC, but Grandma wouldnt let me have any, because of the unhygeinic vendor habits…I am sorry to hear about chesnut blight.  lulu September 20, 2016  http://menus.nypl.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=ansonia  Jodie October 12, 2016  Chip Beef’s not extinct I see it all the time at restaurants. Anyway do you have a recipe for it? Everytime I click recipes at the top it goes away too fast before I can click on breakfast.

Karl Nesselrode

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Count Nesselrode, as painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence in 1818.


Count Karl Robert Nesselrode, also known as Charles de Nesselrode, (Lisbon, Portugal, December 14, 1780 – Saint Petersburg, March 23, 1862; Russian: Карл Васильевич Нессельроде, Karl Vasilyevich Nesselrode) was a Russian Empire diplomat of Baltic-German descent. His mother was Jewish by origin and Protestant by faith. For forty years (1816-1856) Nesselrode as foreign minister guided Russian policy; he was a leading European conservative statesman of the Holy Alliance.
He was born on a Russian frigate[1] at Lisbon, Portugal where his father (d. 1810), a count of the Holy Roman Empire, was the ambassador of the Russian emperor. In deference to his mother's Protestantism he was baptized in the chapel of the British Embassy, thus becoming a member of the Church of England and not the Russian Orthodox Church. Nesselrode's Germanic roots were emphasized by his education in a Berlin gymnasium, his father having been appointed ambassador to the Prussian court about 1787.
At the age of 16 he entered the Russian Navy where, with his father's influence, he secured the position of naval aide-de-camp to Emperor Paul.
He then moved to the army, and entered diplomatic service under Paul I's son and successor, Emperor Alexander I. He was attached to the Russian embassy at Berlin, and transferred thence to the Hague.
In August 1806, Nesselrode received a commission to travel in southern Germany to report on the French troops there; he was then attached as diplomatic secretary to Generals Kamenski, Buxhoewden and Bennigsen in succession.
He was present at the inconclusive Battle of Eylau in January 1807, fought by Count Von Bennigsen and assisted at the negotiations of the Peace of Tilsit, (July 1807), whereby Spanish Bonapartist Diego Fernandez de Velasco, (deceased in Paris in the exile in 1811), 13th Duke of Frías, congratulated and seated at table with Napoleon I.




Nesselrode's tomb in the Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery


Nesselrode became State Secretary in 1814 and was the head of Russia's official delegation to Congress of Vienna, but for the most part Alexander I acted as his own foreign minister. In 1816, Nesselrode became Russian foreign minister, sharing influence with Count Ioannis Kapodistrias until the latter's retirement in 1822.
For forty years, Nesselrode guided Russian policy and was a leading European conservative statesman of the Holy Alliance. Between 1845 and 1856, he served as Chancellor of the Russian Empire. As Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1824, he was a plenipotentiary during negotiations with the United States in defining the boundary between Russian America and the American claims known as the Oregon Country, which was resolved with the Russo-American Treaty of 1824, and a parallel treaty with Britain concerning British claims which overlapped on those of the US. A century later in 1924, Mount Nesselrode in the Boundary Ranges of the Alaska-British Columbia boundary was named for him.[2]
In 1849 Nesselrode sent Russian troops to aid Austria in putting down the Hungarian revolution led by Lajos Kossuth.
One frequently overlooked facet of his activity involved Nesselrode's attempts to penetrate Japan's self-isolation. In 1853 he dispatched Yevfimy Putyatin with a letter to the Shogun; Putyatin returned to St. Petersburg with the favorable Treaty of Shimoda.
Nesselrode's efforts to expand Russia's influence in the Balkans and Mediterranean led to conflicts with Turkey, Britain, the then Kingdom of Sardinia, the then Duchy of Savoy and France, allied in the Crimean War (1853–1856). Britain and France were unhappy with Russia's growing influence, and were determined to support Turkey and so restrict Russia.
His autobiography was published posthumously in 1866.

June 6, 2014 Posted by Florian in Baking, Recipes, Russian Food. Tagged Bavarian cream, Count Karl Nesselrode, Hortense Spier, Nesselrode pie, New York, Russia Nesselrode, Part 2: the Restaurateur, the Old-Timers, and their Pie 

You might remember the story of the Nesselrode Pudding; or, how Paris’ best pastry chef created a dessert for the Russian occupants while working for that turncoat Talleyrand. But perhaps your senile great-grandparents have fondly reminisced about a popular dessert of their New York youth, a symbol of a bygone era, in a slightly different format: the Nesselrode Pie.
I haven’t yet found any solid information on how the delicious chestnut pudding crossed the Atlantic to eventually become a classic New York pie. What I do know is that the pie, as older locals used to know it, was popularized by restaurateur Hortense Spier…

According to The Food Maven, Hortense Spier first started her business not as a pie bakery but as a brownstone restaurant on 94th St between Columbus Ave and Central Park West. The restaurant closed before World War II, and Mrs. Spier started baking her specialty pies for other restaurants. Besides the Nesselrode, there were lemon meringue, banana cream, and coconut custard pies. By the mid-1950s, these were the standard pies served in New York’s seafood restaurants and steakhouses. When Mrs. Spier died, her daughter, Ruth, and daughter-in-law, Mildred, continued the business.
The pie was a popular dessert for the holiday season, as you can see in this 1965 article, “Nesselrode Pie Rings in New Year”. Although already by that point, the recipe didn’t necessarily include chestnuts in any form. Around the same time, chocolate was added, usually as shavings on top. Little by little, industrialization of the American food supply resulted in the dessert’s drift into mediocrity. Could you imagine a pecan pie without pecans? Or a banana split without bananas? Well that’s what the Nesselrode pie became. One can still buy a product called “Nesselro”, which is (or was?) made mostly of candied cauliflower — I still can’t decide if this is repulsive or intriguing.
Mediocrity was followed by oblivion. The New York Times published a piece in 1983 claiming that “you will find the name Nesselrode on menus around the world”, complete with recipes for both a pie and a charlotte (the botched scan of the paper original makes these recipes very hard to read; the one for pie is also partially available here). Yet in the very same New York Times, we learn in 1988 that “Nesselrode pie left our culinary consciousness about 30 years ago and has hardly been heard from since”. Great journalism, guys!
Fast forward 16 years, and The New York Times (them again) acknowledges in 2004 that the dessert has gone the way of the dodo a long time ago, and purports to have found what might be the very last Nesselrode Pie, available at Teena’s Cake Fair in Canarsie, Brooklyn. But alas, Teena’s closed a couple of years ago. And so, finally, it seems that the only way to try Nesselrode Pie today is to make your own.
My recipe combines the old and the new. The chestnuts (prepared from scratch, just like the candied fruits) are the star of the show, and their flavor should be prominent. The addition of chocolate wasn’t a bad idea — the flavors pair well. So I kept the chocolate but used it in two novel ways, both in the crust and in a glaze. The chocolate crust has a hint of bitterness that balances the sweetness of the filling. It is important, however, that the chocolate glaze does not overpower the Bavarian cream, which is why I added cherry jelly to it (another idea would be to add chestnut purée instead).
Candied orange peel
Yields slightly over 1 oz
1/2 navel orange
2 oz water
3.5 oz sugar

Carefully peel and separate the orange into its natural segments. Reserve the segments for another usage.
Cut the peel into 1/4″ x 3″ strips. Weigh 1 oz, and discard the rest.
Blanch the orange peel in boiling water for 7 minutes. Drain and repeat two more times.
In a small saucepan, heat the water and sugar to 230 F, stirring constantly. Add the peel, cover, and simmer over very low heat for 1 hour.
Drain the orange peel, and let cool on a rack for 30 minutes.

Nesselrode fruit mix
Yields 1 pie
2.5 oz dried cherries
2.5 oz golden raisins
1 oz candied orange peel
1.5 oz Maraschino liqueur
1.5 oz Armenian brandy

Place the dried cherries, golden raisins, orange peel, maraschino, and brandy in a small saucepan. Cover with a lid and heat over low heat for 10 minutes. 
Remove from heat, and let rest for at least 1 hour.

Chestnut purée
Yields 1 pie
5 oz cooked chestnuts
3 oz sugar
2 oz water
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract

Boil the chestnuts in a pot of water for 5 minutes, then drain, and reserve.
Place the sugar, water, and vanilla extract in a small saucepan, and heat until dissolved, stirring constantly.
Transfer the sugar syrup to a blender with the chestnuts, then process until smooth. Reserve.

Chocolate pâte brisée
Yields 1 pie (9″ diameter)
6.8 oz flour
0.5.oz cocoa powder
0.5 oz confectioners sugar
1 oz almond powder
1/4 tsp salt
1 egg yolk
3.5 oz butter, diced, at room temperature
2 oz water

Sift the flour, cocoa powder, confectioners sugar, and almond powder into a bowl, and make a well in the center. Put the salt, egg yolk, and butter in the well, and combine using your fingertips, starting from the center outward.
Add the water, and mix until smooth.
Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about 45 minutes.
On a floured surface, roll the dough to a 13″ disc. Transfer the dough to a 2″ tall, 9″ diameter pie dish, leaving any extra to hang over the sides (it tends to shrink when baking).
Prick with a fork, and bake in a 400 F oven for 15 minutes. Take out of the oven, and let cool. Cut off any extra dough remaining over the sides. 

Nesselrode Bavarian cream
Yields 1 pie
3 egg yolks
1 oz sugar
8.8 oz milk
chestnut purée
1 pack (0.25 oz) powdered gelatine
5 oz heavy cream
3 egg whites
Nesselrode fruit mix

In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar to a pale ribbon.
In a saucepan, bring the milk to a boil. Temper the egg yolks with the milk, then return the custard to the saucepan. Heat over low heat, constantly stirring with a spatula, until the custard coats the spatula.
Mix in the chestnut purée and gelatine, then remove from the heat. Process the mixture with a hand blender, and let cool for about 1 hour.
Whip the heavy cream to medium-firm peaks. Fold the chestnut mixture into the whipped cream, and carefully stir in the Nesselrode fruit mix.
Beat the egg whites to medium-firm peaks, and fold into the mixture.
Proceed with the assembly immediately.

Assembly
Yields 1 pie (9″ diameter)
Nesselrode Bavarian cream
chocolate pâte brisée
2.2 oz heavy cream
0.8 oz milk
0.7 oz light corn syrup
1 oz cherry jelly
3 oz 66% dark chocolate, finely chopped

Pour the Nesselrode Bavarian cream into the chocolate pâte brisée. Level with an offset spatula, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for a couple of hours, until set.
In a saucepan, bring the heavy cream, milk, and corn syrup to a boil.
Add the cherry jelly and chocolate, let stand for 1 minute, then stir until homogeneous. Let cool to 90 F.
Gently pour the chocolate glaze over the pie. Use just enough to cover the pie — you might have some glaze left over.
Refrigerate for another hour, then serve.

I remember fondly the Nesselrode Pie of the 1950s and early 60s served at Miller’s Restaurant, located in the Woolworth Building NYC.
