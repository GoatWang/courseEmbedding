History[edit]
Platinum Equity was founded in 1995 by Tom Gores. The firm's first acquisition was LSI, a company that generated computer graphics to re-create accidents for courtroom testimony. After purchasing it for $200,000, Platinum Equity focused on servicing existing customers and returning the company to profitability.[5]
Over the next five years, between July 1996 and September 2001, the firm made 32 acquisitions with $226 million, and realized $940 million on those investments. These acquisitions included a call center (Foresight Software), networking gear (Racal Electronics), and voice and data service (Williams Communications).[5] BusinessWeek ranked the firm number 10 on its 1999 list of the country’s top 20 private IT organizations, based on 1998 revenues.[6][7]
During this period of acquisition growth, additional partners joined the firm and several other joined through key acquisitions starting in 1999.[8][9][10]
The firm’s first fund, Platinum Equity Capital Partners, was raised in 2004 and had a 62.5% net internal rate of return as of June 30, 2009.[11] For the second fund, Platinum Equity Capital Partners II, which closed in September 2008, despite uncertainty in the financial markets. the firm initially sought a $1.5 billion leveraged buyout fund and nearly doubled it by raising $2.75 billion.[12][13]
In 2009, during the financial crisis, Platinum Equity acquired 14 companies in the first 11 months of 2009, eight of them full buyouts.[12]
Investments[edit]
Since 1995, Platinum Equity has acquired over 115 businesses across a broad array of industries, including information technology, telecommunications, logistics and distribution, industrials, manufacturing, media, real estate and automotive. Those acquisitions represent more than $27.5 billion in aggregate annual revenue at the time of acquisition.[14]
Information technology[edit]
In October 2004, the firm completed the acquisition of CompuCom Systems, Inc. which was one of the largest public-to-private transactions in 2004.[15] Then, in December 2004 the company acquired General Electric’s IT Solutions division. The merger brought CompuCom to $1.7 billion in annual revenue and more than $500 million in services.[16] The business was sold to Court Square Capital Partners in 2007.[17]
Logistics and distribution[edit]
In 2002, Platinum combined Health Care Products, a division of Royal Philips Electronics, and Diagnostic Imaging, a subsidiary of PSS World Medical into a single company called SourceOne Healthcare Technologies. Both companies were distributors of radiology products like film, chemicals and lead shields. Together, they had $1.3 billion in revenue, making SourceOne dominant in the very fragmented $11.5 billion marketplace in which it competed.[18] Merry X-Ray acquired SourceOne Healthcare Technologies from Platinum Equity in November 2005.[19]
Industrials[edit]
PNA Group, a metals processor, was acquired in May 2006 from TUI AG. At the time of acquisition, PNA included three companies. While in Platinum Equity’s portfolio PNA gained a seasoned metals CEO, Maurice S. Nelson, Jr. and added three locations.[20] Platinum Equity sold PNA Group to publicly traded Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. (NYSE: RS) in August 2008 for $300 million. The purchase price, together with the $181 million in accumulated profits, represented 27 times Platinum’s original investment of $17.5 million just two years earlier.[21]

American Traffic Solutions, Inc. is looking for acquisition opportunities. Platinum Equity completed the acquisition of American Traffic Solutions.

Spotless Units Reportedly May Be Up For Grabs
Apr 27 17
Units of Spotless Group Holdings Limited (ASX:SPO) are reportedly up for grab. Spotless Group Holdings, which is advised by Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), has denied that any parts of the company are on the market, apart from a group of poorly performing contracts that it earlier indicated it would divest. Spotless Group Holdings had been in talks with a rival bidder, but those discussions were abandoned over the weekend. One possibility is that a party could be eager to buy Spotless Group Holdings without some of its smaller, less-successful components, and investment bankers are trying to find buyers for the unwanted divisions. Possible suitors could be smaller rival Delaware North, which has been approached before, or opportunistic private equity firms like Anchorage Capital Partners, Platinum Equity, LLC or Allegro.

STEELE, Chief Justice.
Platinum Equity LLC ("Platinum") scheduled to acquire certain of Rohn Industries, Inc.'s ("Rohn") assets before the end of 2002, terminated an Asset Purchase Agreement with Rohn under a provision that allowed for termination if Platinum determined in good faith that there was a reasonable basis in law and in fact to conclude that Platinum could reasonably be anticipated to incur any material asbestos related liability after consummating the acquisition. The parties agree that New York law governs their dispute over the contract language. The trial judge determined that Platinum had no objective basis in law or in fact to terminate the agreement. The trial court held, nevertheless, that Platinum had properly terminated the Agreement because it objectively believed in good faith that it would incur a material asbestos-related liability after consummating the acquisition. Rohn now appeals, contending that the trial judge erred by failing to recognize that under New York law, in these circumstances, judicial review must also include review for objective reasonableness. We agree and affirm in part, reverse in part and remand with instructions to enter judgment for Rohn.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On November 27, 2002, plaintiff-appellant Rohn and defendant-appellee Platinum entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement under which Platinum would acquire certain of Rohn's assets related to the manufacture of cell phone towers.
*381 Platinum buys and sells companies and is accustomed to completing purchases under expedited conditions. For this reason, when Rohn advertised that its assets were for sale and stated its desire to consummate the sale by the end of 2002, Platinum was one of two companies that came forward as a viable purchaser.
When Platinum began its due diligence, it learned that Rohn previously had been a division of UNR Industries, a successor to Unarco Industries, Inc., which, before 1970, made products with asbestos. Platinum also learned that, in 1982, as a result of asbestos liabilities, UNR had filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Although the liabilities relating to asbestos had been channeled to a trust and Rohn had since separated from UNR, and Rohn had never manufactured products with asbestos, Platinum requested that a termination clause be added to the Agreement. The termination provision allowed Platinum to terminate the Agreement:
if [Platinum] determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis in law and in fact to conclude that . . . as a result of the consummation of the [Rohn transaction, Platinum] could reasonably be anticipated to have any . . . material liability for any asbestos-related claim. . . .
This termination provision enabled the parties to progress toward an end of the year closing, which, for Rohn to achieve $21 million in tax refunds, was vital to Rohn, yet also permitted Platinum to continue conducting due diligence with regard to asbestos related liabilities.
After consulting with independent expert legal counsel, Platinum concluded that the transaction would expose Platinum to material asbestos related liability, and, citing the termination provision, purported to terminate the Agreement on December 26, 2002. Rohn could not find another purchaser before the end of 2002, and lost millions in tax refunds as a result.
Rohn filed this action on April 14, 2003, seeking damages for breach of contract based upon Platinum's allegedly wrongful termination of the parties' Asset Purchase Agreement.
A Superior Court judge tried the case without a jury from December 13 to 21, 2004, heard testimony from 13 witnesses and admitted more than 250 exhibits. Rohn sought to establish liability by showing that Platinum's concern about asbestos liability, which prompted Platinum to terminate the Agreement, was not objectively reasonable, and that New York law, which governed the Agreement, dictated that an objective, as well as subjective, standard be employed to determine whether Platinum had properly terminated the Agreement. Platinum defended on the ground that it was entitled to invoke the termination provision as long as it determined in good faith that there were reasonable grounds to fear material asbestos related liability  irrespective of whether or not its determination was objectively reasonable. In the alternative, Platinum sought to establish that its determination was, in fact, objectively reasonable.
Rohn appealed on November 28, from the Superior Court's November 22, 2005, Opinion and Order[1] that granted judgment to Platinum on all of Rohn's claims. The trial judge found that the plain language of the Provision "confer[red] discretion on Platinum to terminate the agreement so long as it behaved in good faith." Notably, however, the trial judge also held that Platinum's decision to terminate was objectively unreasonable.
*382 After hearing the parties argue on June 21, 2006, we asked the parties to address, in supplemental memoranda, exactly what under New York law, the parties meant by the Agreement language: "material liability for any asbestos-related claim." The parties filed supplemental memorandums on this issue.

DISCUSSION
The primary issue on appeal is whether the trial judge limited her review to only a good faith analysis of Platinum's decision to terminate and whether she properly did so. The trial judge found no legal theory under which Platinum, in buying non-asbestos assets for value in a non-merger, could have inherited asbestos related liability; indeed, the trial judge determined that UNR's (Rohn's predecessor) asbestos liability was permanently discharged and enjoined so no liability would pass to Platinum. But the trial judge applied a purely subjective standard in holding that Platinum, in good faith, believed that it would incur material asbestos related liability from the transaction and that, therefore, Platinum had properly terminated the Agreement on that basis alone.
On appeal, Rohn argues that the trial judge legally erred by applying a strictly subjective standard. Rohn contends that, under New York law, the termination provision prescribes an objective standard under which a court can review for reasonableness, and that the trial judge herself found that Platinum's belief that it could "reasonably be anticipated to have . . . material liability for any asbestos-related claim . . ." was manifestly unreasonable.[2] In response, Platinum argues that the trial judge correctly held that Platinum's decision to terminate is only properly reviewed as a "good faith" subjective belief. In the alternative, Platinum argues that it had a reasonable basis in law and in fact to conclude (objectively) that it could reasonably anticipate incurring material asbestos related liability if it acquired Rohn's assets.
We review both the trial judge's interpretation of the Agreement's language[3] and her legal conclusions de novo.[4] We review the trial judge's factual findings for clear error alone.[5]
Contrary to the trial judge's determination, New York law follows the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1981) in applying provisions akin to the termination clause at issue. Section 228 provides an objective standard, namely that:
When it is a condition of an obligor's duty that he be satisfied with respect to the obligee's performance or with respect to something else, and it is practicable to determine whether a reasonable person in the position of the obligor would be satisfied, an interpretation is *383 preferred under which the condition occurs if such a reasonable person in the position of the obligor would be satisfied.[6]
As Judge Posner explained in Morin Bldg. Prods. Co. v. Baystone Constr., Inc.,[7] this rule of construction embodies the "presumption that the performing party would not have wanted to put himself at the mercy of the paying party's whim."[8]
Section 228 reflects longstanding New York law.[9] As the New York Court of Appeals held in Alper Blouse Co. v. E.E. Connor & Co.:[10]
While the power to withhold approval is an untrammeled one where the object of the contract is "to gratify taste, serve personal convenience, or satisfy individual preference," a different rule ordinarily prevails, in this state, for commercial contracts where the suitability of the goods is a matter of "mechanical fitness, utility, or marketability"; in such a case, the contract is "construed as imposing upon the seller the requirement only that a reasonable man . . . be satisfied with the performance."[11]
This rule dates back to the 19th Century: "That which the law shall say a contracting party ought, in reason to be satisfied with, that the law will say he is satisfied with."[12]
Alper Blouse and Section 228 remain New York law. For example, in J.D. Cousins & Sons,[13] the Second Circuit, in a diversity case applying New York law, heard an appeal from a case for breach of a contract to perform boiler inspection services. The contract contained a clause that permitted the inspector to make inspections as "he may deem necessary to permit him to certify to the best of his belief" that the boilers complied with applicable codes.[14] Like the trial judge here, the District Court held that words such as "as he may deem necessary" and "to the best of his belief" made this a subjective discretionary determination that the court could not review save for good faith.[15] The Second Circuit disagreed. Citing to Alper Blouse, it ruled that under New York law:

*384 [T]he objective standard was intended to apply in this case. Whether a vessel complies with the applicable ASME standard and is safe are clearly both external and objective facts, similar to issues of merchantability, operative fitness or mechanical utility, which are typically adjudicated under the standard of objective reasonableness.[16]
Similarly, in Rus, Inc. v. Bay Indus., Inc.,[17] the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York held that, when a contract conditions one party's reasonable performance on that party's satisfaction, courts impose a duty of good faith and fair dealing that requires the terminating party to exercise its discretion as would a reasonable person.[18] In Rus, the agreement at issue specified various conditions that one party had to fulfill before the other party's obligation to consummate the contract arose. Among those obligations was the seller's duty to deliver the result of an environmental assessment and audit of the facilities it was selling. The provision at issue conditioned the buyer's performance on the buyer's reasonable satisfaction with the report.[19] The court held that whether the buyer's dissatisfaction with the report was unreasonable depended upon whether "a reasonably prudent buyer would have been sufficiently satisfied with the report to proceed with the transaction."[20] The court further ruled that "to determine whether [the buyer's] dissatisfaction was reasonable, therefore, the factfinder will have to ascertain the severity of the problems disclosed and consider them in light of the transaction as a whole."[21]
Platinum argues that the foregoing authorities are inapposite because the rule that satisfaction be measured against a reasonableness standard is a default rule that applies only when the parties have not agreed to the contrary. Here, Platinum argues, the parties agreed to the contrary by drafting the termination Provision to read "if [Platinum] determines in good faith . . ." To support its contention, however, Platinum relies on case law that actually supports Rohn's position.
In Morin Bldgs. Prods. Co. v. Baystone Constr., Inc.,[22] Judge Posner, recognizing that the requirement of reasonableness may be overcome if the parties expressly contract for a purely subjective standard, opined that "the presumption that the performing party would not have wanted to put himself at the mercy of the paying party's whim is overcome when the nature of the performance contracted for is such that there are no objective standards to guide the court."[23]
*385 Thus, the key question in this case, as derived from Section 288 and New York case law, is whether it is possible to determine objectively whether a reasonable person in Platinum's position would have been satisfied by the protections against asbestos related liability, as distinguished from whether Platinum itself in good faith concluded the protections were unsatisfactory. The trial court's determination that there was no basis in law or fact for terminating the Agreement[24] demonstrates self-evidently that this question is, in fact, answerable. Here, there were objective standards to guide the trial judge, and based on those standards, she concluded that Platinum acted unreasonably.
Because there are objective standards to guide the court's assessment of the reasonableness of Platinum's termination, we hold that the trial judge erred in applying a subjective good faith analysis to determine that Platinum properly terminated the agreement. We find that New York law demands that the termination of a contract in reliance upon a satisfaction clause be objectively reasonable where there are, as here, objective standards to guide the court. Because the record fully supports the trial judge's conclusion that there were no objective bases in law or fact for terminating the Agreement, we affirm that holding.

CONCLUSION
New York law demands that court review of the termination of a contract in reliance upon a satisfaction clause be objectively reasonable where there are objective standards to guide the court. We find that the record fully supports the trial judge's holding that there were no objective bases in law or fact for terminating the Agreement. We, therefore, AFFIRM that holding. The trial judge, however, applied only a good faith subjective standard in determining that Platinum properly terminated the Agreement. We therefore must REVERSE the judgment and REMAND the case to the Superior Court to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff-below-appellant. Jurisdiction is not retained.

Indeed, as Rohn asserts, Rohn would not have agreed to the clause had it believed only a subjective good faith determination would justify termination. To agree to such a provision "would be absurd . . . because Rohn had to close a transaction by December 31st . . . Rohn would not have agreed to a provision that would give the other side the sole discretion to walk away from it at the eleventh and a half hour. . . ." (Trial Tr., 105, Afternoon Dec. 13, 2004.)

History[edit]




Former New Holstein, Wisconsin engine manufacturing plant in 2006. The logo on the sign is that of Tecumseh Power Products.


Tecumseh Products Company was founded by tool and die maker Raymond Herrick, in 1934. Raymond Herrick applied mass production concepts he had learned from automobile manufacturer Henry Ford to the production of refrigeration compressors.
Following the outbreak of World War II, Tecumseh Products Company was called upon, like many American businesses, to aid in the war effort. This resulted in Tecumseh Products Company using its facilities to manufacture artillery shells for allied forces. Following the end of World War II, Tecumseh Products Company continued its production of refrigeration compressors and expanded into manufacturing compressors for air conditioning units.
In 1956, Tecumseh Products Company purchased the Lauson Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1895 by John Lauson. By the time of the purchase in 1956, Lauson Manufacturing Company had grown into one of the largest manufacturers of small gasoline engines in the United States. Following the purchase, Tecumseh Products Company dismantled most of the Lauson Manufacturing Company and used the assets to create Tecumseh Power Company.[3]
In 2009, Tecumseh Products completed a move from Tecumseh, Michigan to Pittsfield Charter Township, Michigan.[4]
In 2007, the company's former gasoline engine and power train product lines were sold to Platinum Equity LLC. In December 2008, the company closed its engine manufacturing division. Later Tecumseh Power sold off its Peerless transmissions business to Husqvarna Outdoor Products. Tecumseh closed its doors on February 2009 when Platinum Equity LLC announced that Tecumseh Power Company had sold certain assets of its engine business to Certified Parts Corporation, including all existing and unfinished engine parts inventory, tools to make finished product and certain intellectual property assets.
The company’s stock (NASDAQ: TECUA) began the year trading at $4.78 per share and rising quickly from mid-January until the end of February has held relatively steady at approximately $8.50 per share since early March.

First hermetically sealed compressor — Introduced in 1938, this innovation greatly increased the performance and life span of home and commercial refrigerators.
First window air conditioner — In 1947 Tecumseh Products Company designed and supplied the compressor for the first window air conditioning unit.

Price-Fixing Scandal[edit]
Pittsfield Township-based Tecumseh Products Co., along with units of Benton Harbor-based Whirlpool Corp., as well as a division of a Danish parts-supplier, agreed in 2013 to a settlement in a price-fixing lawsuit. The settlement cost Tecumseh approximately $7 million, according to a report in Crain’s Detroit Business. The lawsuit, which was consolidated before U.S. District Judge Sean Cox in 2009, centers on a secret meeting between executives of the companies as well as Panasonic Corp., and an Italy-based components company. According to Crain’s, the group allegedly met at a hotel in 2004 as part of a conspiracy to inflate the price of compressors. Crain’s reported the settlement totaled $41 million and must be approved by Judge Cox before it is implemented. Tecumseh’s portion represents 2.7 percent of the company’s sales between February 2005 and December 2008. Tecumseh Products has had an eventful 2013. [5][6]
Gasoline engine components[edit]
In 2007, the company's former gasoline engine and power train product lines, which is what the company had been most known for, were sold to Platinum Equity LLC, which does business as Tecumseh Power. Tecumseh engine products at one time were sold in over 120 countries. In December 2008, the company closed its engine manufacturing division.[7] TecumsehPower sold off its Peerless transmissions business to McDermott Outdoor Products.[7]
On February 10, 2009, Platinum Equity LLC announced that Tecumseh Power Company had sold certain assets of its engine business to Certified Parts Corporation. This included the sale of existing and unfinished engine parts inventory, tools to make finished product and certain intellectual property assets. Certified Parts Corporation also assumed responsibility for warranty of previous engine sales.[8]
In an interview published by The Janesville Gazette on February 10, 2009, Certified Parts Corporation President Jim Grafft said "that he plans to move the engine operation to Rock County, Wisconsin, where he owns three facilities in Janesville and one in Edgerton, and will initially supply parts for Tecumseh Power engines. Grafft also said that his company could eventually resume engine production, which Tecumseh Power ceased in December 2008".
On September 1, 2010, Certified Parts Corporation (CPC) of Janesville, Wisconsin, announced it had entered into an agreement with LCT, (Liquid Combustion Technology) of Travelers Rest, South Carolina, to jointly manufacture air-cooled engines for the outdoor power equipment market. The agreement provided CPC with engineering, manufacturing, and sales capabilities allowing it to reintroduce the Snow King line of snow thrower engines and other engines formerly manufactured and sold by TecumsehPower. The engines are exclusively represented by LCT, and sold under the Snow King, Lauson, and LCT brands and serviced exclusively by CPC and the existing TecumsehPower dealer/distributor network. Traditionally, the Snow King line of engines had powered more snowthrowers than all other brands combined.[9]
LCT's horizontal 4-stroke gasoline engine product offering was extended by this agreement, and allowed CPC and LCT to provide single cylinder and V-twin vertical engines to outdoor power equipment manufacturers. According to Larry Zeman, VP of Winter Engine Products for LCT, "This establishes LCT as an engine manufacturer of choice as it continues to engineer a new generation of power."[10]

History[edit]




Former New Holstein, Wisconsin engine manufacturing plant in 2006. The logo on the sign is that of Tecumseh Power Products.


Tecumseh Products Company was founded by tool and die maker Raymond Herrick, in 1934. Raymond Herrick applied mass production concepts he had learned from automobile manufacturer Henry Ford to the production of refrigeration compressors.
Following the outbreak of World War II, Tecumseh Products Company was called upon, like many American businesses, to aid in the war effort. This resulted in Tecumseh Products Company using its facilities to manufacture artillery shells for allied forces. Following the end of World War II, Tecumseh Products Company continued its production of refrigeration compressors and expanded into manufacturing compressors for air conditioning units.
In 1956, Tecumseh Products Company purchased the Lauson Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1895 by John Lauson. By the time of the purchase in 1956, Lauson Manufacturing Company had grown into one of the largest manufacturers of small gasoline engines in the United States. Following the purchase, Tecumseh Products Company dismantled most of the Lauson Manufacturing Company and used the assets to create Tecumseh Power Company.[3]
In 2009, Tecumseh Products completed a move from Tecumseh, Michigan to Pittsfield Charter Township, Michigan.[4]
In 2007, the company's former gasoline engine and power train product lines were sold to Platinum Equity LLC. In December 2008, the company closed its engine manufacturing division. Later Tecumseh Power sold off its Peerless transmissions business to Husqvarna Outdoor Products. Tecumseh closed its doors on February 2009 when Platinum Equity LLC announced that Tecumseh Power Company had sold certain assets of its engine business to Certified Parts Corporation, including all existing and unfinished engine parts inventory, tools to make finished product and certain intellectual property assets.
The company’s stock (NASDAQ: TECUA) began the year trading at $4.78 per share and rising quickly from mid-January until the end of February has held relatively steady at approximately $8.50 per share since early March.

First hermetically sealed compressor — Introduced in 1938, this innovation greatly increased the performance and life span of home and commercial refrigerators.
First window air conditioner — In 1947 Tecumseh Products Company designed and supplied the compressor for the first window air conditioning unit.

Price-Fixing Scandal[edit]
Pittsfield Township-based Tecumseh Products Co., along with units of Benton Harbor-based Whirlpool Corp., as well as a division of a Danish parts-supplier, agreed in 2013 to a settlement in a price-fixing lawsuit. The settlement cost Tecumseh approximately $7 million, according to a report in Crain’s Detroit Business. The lawsuit, which was consolidated before U.S. District Judge Sean Cox in 2009, centers on a secret meeting between executives of the companies as well as Panasonic Corp., and an Italy-based components company. According to Crain’s, the group allegedly met at a hotel in 2004 as part of a conspiracy to inflate the price of compressors. Crain’s reported the settlement totaled $41 million and must be approved by Judge Cox before it is implemented. Tecumseh’s portion represents 2.7 percent of the company’s sales between February 2005 and December 2008. Tecumseh Products has had an eventful 2013. [5][6]
Gasoline engine components[edit]
In 2007, the company's former gasoline engine and power train product lines, which is what the company had been most known for, were sold to Platinum Equity LLC, which does business as Tecumseh Power. Tecumseh engine products at one time were sold in over 120 countries. In December 2008, the company closed its engine manufacturing division.[7] TecumsehPower sold off its Peerless transmissions business to McDermott Outdoor Products.[7]
On February 10, 2009, Platinum Equity LLC announced that Tecumseh Power Company had sold certain assets of its engine business to Certified Parts Corporation. This included the sale of existing and unfinished engine parts inventory, tools to make finished product and certain intellectual property assets. Certified Parts Corporation also assumed responsibility for warranty of previous engine sales.[8]
In an interview published by The Janesville Gazette on February 10, 2009, Certified Parts Corporation President Jim Grafft said "that he plans to move the engine operation to Rock County, Wisconsin, where he owns three facilities in Janesville and one in Edgerton, and will initially supply parts for Tecumseh Power engines. Grafft also said that his company could eventually resume engine production, which Tecumseh Power ceased in December 2008".
On September 1, 2010, Certified Parts Corporation (CPC) of Janesville, Wisconsin, announced it had entered into an agreement with LCT, (Liquid Combustion Technology) of Travelers Rest, South Carolina, to jointly manufacture air-cooled engines for the outdoor power equipment market. The agreement provided CPC with engineering, manufacturing, and sales capabilities allowing it to reintroduce the Snow King line of snow thrower engines and other engines formerly manufactured and sold by TecumsehPower. The engines are exclusively represented by LCT, and sold under the Snow King, Lauson, and LCT brands and serviced exclusively by CPC and the existing TecumsehPower dealer/distributor network. Traditionally, the Snow King line of engines had powered more snowthrowers than all other brands combined.[9]
LCT's horizontal 4-stroke gasoline engine product offering was extended by this agreement, and allowed CPC and LCT to provide single cylinder and V-twin vertical engines to outdoor power equipment manufacturers. According to Larry Zeman, VP of Winter Engine Products for LCT, "This establishes LCT as an engine manufacturer of choice as it continues to engineer a new generation of power."[10]

Profile: Kristian Coffey
Certified Wealth Strategist® and Retirement Income Certified Professional®










A native of Massachusetts, Kris was born and raised in Springfield. At an early age, his parents, a fireman and a teacher, taught him some of the values important to middle-class America: a strong work ethic and the importance of saving. Kris believes that being taught these values in addition to working on a farm at age 14 helped him learn that what you earn is far more satisfying than what is handed to you.
Kris earned his BA in Economics from the University of Massachusetts – Amherst. After receiving his degree, he stepped into the world of finance and excelled in the diverse positions he held, whether as a Financial Advisor for Bank of America helping Baby Boomers with their income needs or as a Financial Analyst for State Street Bank providing financial reporting for mutual funds and pensions funds.
Although he believes in sound investment decisions, Kris is also motivated by a simple motto: “Enjoy life!” He believes that a life of hard work should pay during retirement and that it is as important to enjoy your money as it is to protect it. And he takes his role as the one to show his clients how this is done very seriously. He believes in providing the client with a plan for today and tomorrow, and the motivation to fulfill that plan.
In his free time, Kris likes to fish and golf, and during winter, he ventures out on the ski trails of New England. And of course, as a native of Massachusetts, he cheers for the Sox, the Celtics, the Bruins, and the Patriots.
