                Please be sure you have access to send and receive emails from the email address your university has given you with their domain name (example: You@YourUniversity.edu).
                We will email you a registration to your university email address within a few minutes for you to click on in order to confirm you do have access to it and that you are not a robot.
            

                Med+Proctor requires you to use two-part authentication, so please be ready with a mobile device that can receive texts or an alternate email you can use to receive an additional timed security code.
                This will be used again when you attempt to reset your password or make any major account modifications.
            

                Your university may require you to enter your Student ID for internal tracking purposes. Please have it ready if so.
