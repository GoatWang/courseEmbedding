Interxion is a European provider of carrier and cloud-neutral colocation data centre services. Founded in 1998 in the Netherlands, the firm was publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange on January 28, 2011.[2] Interxion is headquartered in Schiphol-Rijk, the Netherlands, and delivers its services through 40 data centres in 11 countries located in major metropolitan areas, including London, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and Madrid, the main data centre markets in Europe.
The company’s core offering is carrier-neutral colocation, which includes provision of space, power and a secure environment in which to house customers’ computing, network, storage and IT infrastructure. Interxion also supplements its core colocation offering with a number of additional services, including systems monitoring, systems management, engineering support services, data back-up and storage.
Within its data centres, Interxion enables approximately 1,500 customers to house their equipment and connect to a broad range of telecommunications carriers, ISPs and other customers. The data centres act as content and connectivity hubs that facilitate the processing, storage, sharing and distribution of data, content, applications and media among carriers and customers.
Interxion’s customer base is in high-growth market segments, including financial services, cloud and managed services providers, digital media and carriers. Customers in these target markets enable expansion of existing communities of interest and build new, high-value communities of interest within the data centre. Communities of interest are particularly important to customers in each of these market segments. For example, customers in the digital media segment benefit from the close proximity to content delivery network providers and Internet exchanges in order to rapidly deliver content to consumers. Interxion expects the high-value and reduced-cost benefits of communities of interest to continue to attract new customers.[3]
Interxion’s data centres enable its customers to connect to more than 500 carriers and ISPs and 20 European Internet exchanges, allowing them to lower telecommunications costs and reduce latency times.[citation needed]

Communities of interest[edit]
Interxion focuses its efforts on attracting customers in well-defined sectors of industry:[4]
Digital Media[edit]
Interxion has created Content Hubs across its European data centre footprint. The hubs allow organisations to aggregate, exchange, store, manage and distribute content in addition to interconnecting with a large digital media community, helping to optimise distribution and minimise costs.[5]
Financial Services[edit]
Interxion has created Financial Hubs[6] across key European financial markets, including London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Stockholm. The Hubs consist of highly interactive and extensive communities of capital markets participants, including a range of algorithmic and high-frequency traders, brokers, hedge funds, exchanges, MTF’s, market data providers and clearing houses. The Financial Hubs are accessible via a wide range of carriers and high bandwidth fibre connectivity providers.
Cloud[edit]
Interxion has created Cloud Hubs across its European footprint,[7] creating an optimum environment for cost-effective development, launch and management of cloud-based services for enterprises, systems integrators and cloud service providers. The hubs also enable fast, easy interconnection with one of Europe's largest and fastest-growing community of cloud operators.
Carriers and network providers[edit]
Interxion works with many carriers, network providers and Internet Service Providers as well as 20vInternet Exchanges, neutral Ethernet exchanges, CDN’s and over 500 carriers. Existing Interxion customers can interconnect data centres to any of these parties via a simple cross connect using the Ethernet platform within Interxion data centres.
History[edit]
European Telecom Exchange BV was incorporated on April 6, 1998, which (after being renamed Interxion Holding B.V. on June 12, 1998) was converted into Interxion Holding N.V. on January 11, 2000. Interxion completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on January 28, 2011.[8] Interxion was founded by Bart van den Dries. A first round of venture capital was provided by Residex together with some informal investors.
On October 15, 2015, the Montreuil administrative tribunal (fr) ordered Interxion to stop using the La Courneuve data centre because of noise pollution concerns raised by the inhabitants.[9]
Industry standards and accreditations[edit]
Interxion is certified with BS 25999,[10][11] the British Standards Institution ( BSI) standard for business continuity management. This has been integrated with Interxion’s existing Information Security Management System (ISMS) certification ISO 27001:2005[12] standard for all of its European country operations. In addition, the company’s European Customer Service Centre (ECSC) team has now been trained in ITIL v3, the latest Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) standard. BS 25999 is the world's first Business Continuity Management (BCM) standard, developed to minimise the risks of disruptions, which can impact a business. The standard is designed to keep businesses operational during challenging times by protecting staff, preserving reputations and providing the ability to keep trading. Interxion’s development of a BCM system involved integrating with the already established Information Security Management System, ISO 27001, an internationally recognised certification designed to assess levels of risk across an entire company’s data centre network.

In 2010 Interxion’s Technology and Engineering Group was recognised for its “Outstanding Contribution to the Data Centre Sector”[13] at the sixth annual Data Centre Europe awards ceremony held at Espaces Antipolis in Nice, France. Interxion was nominated in the Green I.T. Awards 2011 as a finalist for “IT Operator of the Year”.[14]
Memberships[edit]
Interxion is a member of the following organisations:

RIPE[15]
Euro-IX[16]
Irish Internet Association[17]
The Green Grid – Contributor Member[18]
The Green Grid – Advisory Council[19]
The Uptime Institute[20]

Colocation services[edit]
Security[edit]
Interxion data centre buildings are typically designed with five layers of physical security: the perimeter fence, the security gate and entrance, mantraps into the data centre, access systems into the rooms and secure, locked cabinets. Clients can introduce additional levels, such as lockable cages or cubes (containment aisles), as required. No one enters or leaves the data centre without proof of identity, such as national ID, passport or driving license; and all visitors are checked against customer-defined access lists. There are multiple physical security layers, including CCTV, man traps and 24x7 controlled access. All building areas are secured by an alarm system, and an external security firm patrols the area, both inside and outside. Interxion utilises ISO 27001-certified information security management systems.[citation needed]
Power[edit]
Interxion provides managed power with resilience built in all the way to the cabinet and server if required and a minimum N+1 configuration on power infrastructure with facilities such as high-speed refuelling. The continuously improving design specification supports a modular build, including critical infrastructure. Extra equipment can be added to the infrastructure to increase capacity without causing outages.[citation needed]
Controlled environment[edit]
All equipment is maintained and continuously monitored in a climate-controlled environment. The average temperature inside the cold aisle is controlled between 18 and 25 °C and a humidity level of 50% ± 10%. Multiple air conditioning units provide redundant capacity. Early warning systems installed as standard detect hot spots before they become a problem.[citation needed]
Energy efficiency[edit]
After joining the Green Grid association in 2008[21] and becoming a Contributor Member and part of the Advisory Council, Interxion has committed to continuously investigate efficiency opportunities such as free cooling as standard, ground water cooling, and waste heat re-use. Continuous monitoring and measuring provides information about the environments and enables identification of opportunities to improve efficiency. The flexible design provides a scalable infrastructure model.[22]
Connectivity[edit]
Interxion connects to more than 400 individual carriers and ISPs as well as 18 European Internet exchanges. This is part of the carrier-neutral data centre concept.
Carriers[edit]
Interxion hosts global Tier 1, regional Tier 2 and national Tier 3 networks with direct access to the backbone infrastructure and PoP’s for over 400 carriers across its European footprint. These carriers are present at Interxion’s data centres both to interconnect to other carriers but also to take advantage of the customer communities within the data centres.
Internet exchanges[edit]
Internet exchanges are the major points on the Internet where networks interconnect. They serve as an exchange point for the traffic of the Internet via bi-lateral, settlement-free peering agreements. Interxion houses 18 such Internet exchanges in Europe. Interxion is an active supporter of the public Internet exchanges and was an active participant in the creation of Euro-IX.

Interxion is a European provider of carrier and cloud-neutral colocation data centre services. Founded in 1998 in the Netherlands, the firm was publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange on January 28, 2011.[2] Interxion is headquartered in Schiphol-Rijk, the Netherlands, and delivers its services through 40 data centres in 11 countries located in major metropolitan areas, including London, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and Madrid, the main data centre markets in Europe.
The company’s core offering is carrier-neutral colocation, which includes provision of space, power and a secure environment in which to house customers’ computing, network, storage and IT infrastructure. Interxion also supplements its core colocation offering with a number of additional services, including systems monitoring, systems management, engineering support services, data back-up and storage.
Within its data centres, Interxion enables approximately 1,500 customers to house their equipment and connect to a broad range of telecommunications carriers, ISPs and other customers. The data centres act as content and connectivity hubs that facilitate the processing, storage, sharing and distribution of data, content, applications and media among carriers and customers.
Interxion’s customer base is in high-growth market segments, including financial services, cloud and managed services providers, digital media and carriers. Customers in these target markets enable expansion of existing communities of interest and build new, high-value communities of interest within the data centre. Communities of interest are particularly important to customers in each of these market segments. For example, customers in the digital media segment benefit from the close proximity to content delivery network providers and Internet exchanges in order to rapidly deliver content to consumers. Interxion expects the high-value and reduced-cost benefits of communities of interest to continue to attract new customers.[3]
Interxion’s data centres enable its customers to connect to more than 500 carriers and ISPs and 20 European Internet exchanges, allowing them to lower telecommunications costs and reduce latency times.[citation needed]

Communities of interest[edit]
Interxion focuses its efforts on attracting customers in well-defined sectors of industry:[4]
Digital Media[edit]
Interxion has created Content Hubs across its European data centre footprint. The hubs allow organisations to aggregate, exchange, store, manage and distribute content in addition to interconnecting with a large digital media community, helping to optimise distribution and minimise costs.[5]
Financial Services[edit]
Interxion has created Financial Hubs[6] across key European financial markets, including London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Stockholm. The Hubs consist of highly interactive and extensive communities of capital markets participants, including a range of algorithmic and high-frequency traders, brokers, hedge funds, exchanges, MTF’s, market data providers and clearing houses. The Financial Hubs are accessible via a wide range of carriers and high bandwidth fibre connectivity providers.
Cloud[edit]
Interxion has created Cloud Hubs across its European footprint,[7] creating an optimum environment for cost-effective development, launch and management of cloud-based services for enterprises, systems integrators and cloud service providers. The hubs also enable fast, easy interconnection with one of Europe's largest and fastest-growing community of cloud operators.
Carriers and network providers[edit]
Interxion works with many carriers, network providers and Internet Service Providers as well as 20vInternet Exchanges, neutral Ethernet exchanges, CDN’s and over 500 carriers. Existing Interxion customers can interconnect data centres to any of these parties via a simple cross connect using the Ethernet platform within Interxion data centres.
History[edit]
European Telecom Exchange BV was incorporated on April 6, 1998, which (after being renamed Interxion Holding B.V. on June 12, 1998) was converted into Interxion Holding N.V. on January 11, 2000. Interxion completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on January 28, 2011.[8] Interxion was founded by Bart van den Dries. A first round of venture capital was provided by Residex together with some informal investors.
On October 15, 2015, the Montreuil administrative tribunal (fr) ordered Interxion to stop using the La Courneuve data centre because of noise pollution concerns raised by the inhabitants.[9]
Industry standards and accreditations[edit]
Interxion is certified with BS 25999,[10][11] the British Standards Institution ( BSI) standard for business continuity management. This has been integrated with Interxion’s existing Information Security Management System (ISMS) certification ISO 27001:2005[12] standard for all of its European country operations. In addition, the company’s European Customer Service Centre (ECSC) team has now been trained in ITIL v3, the latest Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) standard. BS 25999 is the world's first Business Continuity Management (BCM) standard, developed to minimise the risks of disruptions, which can impact a business. The standard is designed to keep businesses operational during challenging times by protecting staff, preserving reputations and providing the ability to keep trading. Interxion’s development of a BCM system involved integrating with the already established Information Security Management System, ISO 27001, an internationally recognised certification designed to assess levels of risk across an entire company’s data centre network.
Awards[edit]
In 2010 Interxion’s Technology and Engineering Group was recognised for its “Outstanding Contribution to the Data Centre Sector”[13] at the sixth annual Data Centre Europe awards ceremony held at Espaces Antipolis in Nice, France. Interxion was nominated in the Green I.T. Awards 2011 as a finalist for “IT Operator of the Year”.[14]
Memberships[edit]
Interxion is a member of the following organisations:

RIPE[15]
Euro-IX[16]
Irish Internet Association[17]
The Green Grid – Contributor Member[18]
The Green Grid – Advisory Council[19]
The Uptime Institute[20]

Colocation services[edit]
Security[edit]
Interxion data centre buildings are typically designed with five layers of physical security: the perimeter fence, the security gate and entrance, mantraps into the data centre, access systems into the rooms and secure, locked cabinets. Clients can introduce additional levels, such as lockable cages or cubes (containment aisles), as required. No one enters or leaves the data centre without proof of identity, such as national ID, passport or driving license; and all visitors are checked against customer-defined access lists. There are multiple physical security layers, including CCTV, man traps and 24x7 controlled access. All building areas are secured by an alarm system, and an external security firm patrols the area, both inside and outside. Interxion utilises ISO 27001-certified information security management systems.[citation needed]
Power[edit]
Interxion provides managed power with resilience built in all the way to the cabinet and server if required and a minimum N+1 configuration on power infrastructure with facilities such as high-speed refuelling. The continuously improving design specification supports a modular build, including critical infrastructure. Extra equipment can be added to the infrastructure to increase capacity without causing outages.[citation needed]
Controlled environment[edit]
All equipment is maintained and continuously monitored in a climate-controlled environment. The average temperature inside the cold aisle is controlled between 18 and 25 °C and a humidity level of 50% ± 10%. Multiple air conditioning units provide redundant capacity. Early warning systems installed as standard detect hot spots before they become a problem.[citation needed]
Energy efficiency[edit]
After joining the Green Grid association in 2008[21] and becoming a Contributor Member and part of the Advisory Council, Interxion has committed to continuously investigate efficiency opportunities such as free cooling as standard, ground water cooling, and waste heat re-use. Continuous monitoring and measuring provides information about the environments and enables identification of opportunities to improve efficiency. The flexible design provides a scalable infrastructure model.[22]
Connectivity[edit]
Interxion connects to more than 400 individual carriers and ISPs as well as 18 European Internet exchanges. This is part of the carrier-neutral data centre concept.
Carriers[edit]
Interxion hosts global Tier 1, regional Tier 2 and national Tier 3 networks with direct access to the backbone infrastructure and PoP’s for over 400 carriers across its European footprint. These carriers are present at Interxion’s data centres both to interconnect to other carriers but also to take advantage of the customer communities within the data centres.
Internet exchanges[edit]
Internet exchanges are the major points on the Internet where networks interconnect. They serve as an exchange point for the traffic of the Internet via bi-lateral, settlement-free peering agreements. Interxion houses 18 such Internet exchanges in Europe. Interxion is an active supporter of the public Internet exchanges and was an active participant in the creation of Euro-IX.

Communities of interest[edit]
Interxion focuses its efforts on attracting customers in well-defined sectors of industry:[4]
Digital Media[edit]
Interxion has created Content Hubs across its European data centre footprint. The hubs allow organisations to aggregate, exchange, store, manage and distribute content in addition to interconnecting with a large digital media community, helping to optimise distribution and minimise costs.[5]
Financial Services[edit]
Interxion has created Financial Hubs[6] across key European financial markets, including London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Stockholm. The Hubs consist of highly interactive and extensive communities of capital markets participants, including a range of algorithmic and high-frequency traders, brokers, hedge funds, exchanges, MTF’s, market data providers and clearing houses. The Financial Hubs are accessible via a wide range of carriers and high bandwidth fibre connectivity providers.
Cloud[edit]
Interxion has created Cloud Hubs across its European footprint,[7] creating an optimum environment for cost-effective development, launch and management of cloud-based services for enterprises, systems integrators and cloud service providers. The hubs also enable fast, easy interconnection with one of Europe's largest and fastest-growing community of cloud operators.
Carriers and network providers[edit]
Interxion works with many carriers, network providers and Internet Service Providers as well as 20vInternet Exchanges, neutral Ethernet exchanges, CDN’s and over 500 carriers. Existing Interxion customers can interconnect data centres to any of these parties via a simple cross connect using the Ethernet platform within Interxion data centres.
History[edit]
European Telecom Exchange BV was incorporated on April 6, 1998, which (after being renamed Interxion Holding B.V. on June 12, 1998) was converted into Interxion Holding N.V. on January 11, 2000. Interxion completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on January 28, 2011.[8] Interxion was founded by Bart van den Dries. A first round of venture capital was provided by Residex together with some informal investors.
On October 15, 2015, the Montreuil administrative tribunal (fr) ordered Interxion to stop using the La Courneuve data centre because of noise pollution concerns raised by the inhabitants.[9]
Industry standards and accreditations[edit]
Interxion is certified with BS 25999,[10][11] the British Standards Institution ( BSI) standard for business continuity management. This has been integrated with Interxion’s existing Information Security Management System (ISMS) certification ISO 27001:2005[12] standard for all of its European country operations. In addition, the company’s European Customer Service Centre (ECSC) team has now been trained in ITIL v3, the latest Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) standard. BS 25999 is the world's first Business Continuity Management (BCM) standard, developed to minimise the risks of disruptions, which can impact a business. The standard is designed to keep businesses operational during challenging times by protecting staff, preserving reputations and providing the ability to keep trading. Interxion’s development of a BCM system involved integrating with the already established Information Security Management System, ISO 27001, an internationally recognised certification designed to assess levels of risk across an entire company’s data centre network.
Awards[edit]
In 2010 Interxion’s Technology and Engineering Group was recognised for its “Outstanding Contribution to the Data Centre Sector”[13] at the sixth annual Data Centre Europe awards ceremony held at Espaces Antipolis in Nice, France. Interxion was nominated in the Green I.T. Awards 2011 as a finalist for “IT Operator of the Year”.[14]
Memberships[edit]
Interxion is a member of the following organisations:

RIPE[15]
Euro-IX[16]
Irish Internet Association[17]
The Green Grid – Contributor Member[18]
The Green Grid – Advisory Council[19]
The Uptime Institute[20]

Colocation services[edit]
Security[edit]
Interxion data centre buildings are typically designed with five layers of physical security: the perimeter fence, the security gate and entrance, mantraps into the data centre, access systems into the rooms and secure, locked cabinets. Clients can introduce additional levels, such as lockable cages or cubes (containment aisles), as required. No one enters or leaves the data centre without proof of identity, such as national ID, passport or driving license; and all visitors are checked against customer-defined access lists. There are multiple physical security layers, including CCTV, man traps and 24x7 controlled access. All building areas are secured by an alarm system, and an external security firm patrols the area, both inside and outside. Interxion utilises ISO 27001-certified information security management systems.[citation needed]
Power[edit]
Interxion provides managed power with resilience built in all the way to the cabinet and server if required and a minimum N+1 configuration on power infrastructure with facilities such as high-speed refuelling. The continuously improving design specification supports a modular build, including critical infrastructure. Extra equipment can be added to the infrastructure to increase capacity without causing outages.[citation needed]
Controlled environment[edit]
All equipment is maintained and continuously monitored in a climate-controlled environment. The average temperature inside the cold aisle is controlled between 18 and 25 °C and a humidity level of 50% ± 10%. Multiple air conditioning units provide redundant capacity. Early warning systems installed as standard detect hot spots before they become a problem.[citation needed]
Energy efficiency[edit]
After joining the Green Grid association in 2008[21] and becoming a Contributor Member and part of the Advisory Council, Interxion has committed to continuously investigate efficiency opportunities such as free cooling as standard, ground water cooling, and waste heat re-use. Continuous monitoring and measuring provides information about the environments and enables identification of opportunities to improve efficiency. The flexible design provides a scalable infrastructure model.[22]
Connectivity[edit]
Interxion connects to more than 400 individual carriers and ISPs as well as 18 European Internet exchanges. This is part of the carrier-neutral data centre concept.
Carriers[edit]
Interxion hosts global Tier 1, regional Tier 2 and national Tier 3 networks with direct access to the backbone infrastructure and PoP’s for over 400 carriers across its European footprint. These carriers are present at Interxion’s data centres both to interconnect to other carriers but also to take advantage of the customer communities within the data centres.
Internet exchanges[edit]
Internet exchanges are the major points on the Internet where networks interconnect. They serve as an exchange point for the traffic of the Internet via bi-lateral, settlement-free peering agreements. Interxion houses 18 such Internet exchanges in Europe. Interxion is an active supporter of the public Internet exchanges and was an active participant in the creation of Euro-IX.

Interxion is a European provider of carrier and cloud-neutral colocation data centre services. Founded in 1998 in the Netherlands, the firm was publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange on January 28, 2011.[2] Interxion is headquartered in Schiphol-Rijk, the Netherlands, and delivers its services through 40 data centres in 11 countries located in major metropolitan areas, including London, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and Madrid, the main data centre markets in Europe.
The company’s core offering is carrier-neutral colocation, which includes provision of space, power and a secure environment in which to house customers’ computing, network, storage and IT infrastructure. Interxion also supplements its core colocation offering with a number of additional services, including systems monitoring, systems management, engineering support services, data back-up and storage.
Within its data centres, Interxion enables approximately 1,500 customers to house their equipment and connect to a broad range of telecommunications carriers, ISPs and other customers. The data centres act as content and connectivity hubs that facilitate the processing, storage, sharing and distribution of data, content, applications and media among carriers and customers.
Interxion’s customer base is in high-growth market segments, including financial services, cloud and managed services providers, digital media and carriers. Customers in these target markets enable expansion of existing communities of interest and build new, high-value communities of interest within the data centre. Communities of interest are particularly important to customers in each of these market segments. For example, customers in the digital media segment benefit from the close proximity to content delivery network providers and Internet exchanges in order to rapidly deliver content to consumers. Interxion expects the high-value and reduced-cost benefits of communities of interest to continue to attract new customers.[3]
Interxion’s data centres enable its customers to connect to more than 500 carriers and ISPs and 20 European Internet exchanges, allowing them to lower telecommunications costs and reduce latency times.[citation needed]

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for InterXion Holding N.V. (NYSE:INXN) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings.

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 7 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.78)Consensus Price Target: $46.86 (1.99% downside)

Interxion is a European provider of carrier and cloud-neutral colocation data centre services. Founded in 1998 in the Netherlands, the firm was publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange on January 28, 2011.[2] Interxion is headquartered in Schiphol-Rijk, the Netherlands, and delivers its services through 40 data centres in 11 countries located in major metropolitan areas, including London, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and Madrid, the main data centre markets in Europe.
The company’s core offering is carrier-neutral colocation, which includes provision of space, power and a secure environment in which to house customers’ computing, network, storage and IT infrastructure. Interxion also supplements its core colocation offering with a number of additional services, including systems monitoring, systems management, engineering support services, data back-up and storage.
Within its data centres, Interxion enables approximately 1,500 customers to house their equipment and connect to a broad range of telecommunications carriers, ISPs and other customers. The data centres act as content and connectivity hubs that facilitate the processing, storage, sharing and distribution of data, content, applications and media among carriers and customers.
Interxion’s customer base is in high-growth market segments, including financial services, cloud and managed services providers, digital media and carriers. Customers in these target markets enable expansion of existing communities of interest and build new, high-value communities of interest within the data centre. Communities of interest are particularly important to customers in each of these market segments. For example, customers in the digital media segment benefit from the close proximity to content delivery network providers and Internet exchanges in order to rapidly deliver content to consumers. Interxion expects the high-value and reduced-cost benefits of communities of interest to continue to attract new customers.[3]
Interxion’s data centres enable its customers to connect to more than 500 carriers and ISPs and 20 European Internet exchanges, allowing them to lower telecommunications costs and reduce latency times.[citation needed]

Communities of interest[edit]
Interxion focuses its efforts on attracting customers in well-defined sectors of industry:[4]
Digital Media[edit]
Interxion has created Content Hubs across its European data centre footprint. The hubs allow organisations to aggregate, exchange, store, manage and distribute content in addition to interconnecting with a large digital media community, helping to optimise distribution and minimise costs.[5]
Financial Services[edit]
Interxion has created Financial Hubs[6] across key European financial markets, including London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Stockholm. The Hubs consist of highly interactive and extensive communities of capital markets participants, including a range of algorithmic and high-frequency traders, brokers, hedge funds, exchanges, MTF’s, market data providers and clearing houses. The Financial Hubs are accessible via a wide range of carriers and high bandwidth fibre connectivity providers.
Cloud[edit]
Interxion has created Cloud Hubs across its European footprint,[7] creating an optimum environment for cost-effective development, launch and management of cloud-based services for enterprises, systems integrators and cloud service providers. The hubs also enable fast, easy interconnection with one of Europe's largest and fastest-growing community of cloud operators.
Carriers and network providers[edit]
Interxion works with many carriers, network providers and Internet Service Providers as well as 20vInternet Exchanges, neutral Ethernet exchanges, CDN’s and over 500 carriers. Existing Interxion customers can interconnect data centres to any of these parties via a simple cross connect using the Ethernet platform within Interxion data centres.
History[edit]
European Telecom Exchange BV was incorporated on April 6, 1998, which (after being renamed Interxion Holding B.V. on June 12, 1998) was converted into Interxion Holding N.V. on January 11, 2000. Interxion completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on January 28, 2011.[8] Interxion was founded by Bart van den Dries. A first round of venture capital was provided by Residex together with some informal investors.
On October 15, 2015, the Montreuil administrative tribunal (fr) ordered Interxion to stop using the La Courneuve data centre because of noise pollution concerns raised by the inhabitants.[9]
Industry standards and accreditations[edit]
Interxion is certified with BS 25999,[10][11] the British Standards Institution ( BSI) standard for business continuity management. This has been integrated with Interxion’s existing Information Security Management System (ISMS) certification ISO 27001:2005[12] standard for all of its European country operations. In addition, the company’s European Customer Service Centre (ECSC) team has now been trained in ITIL v3, the latest Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) standard. BS 25999 is the world's first Business Continuity Management (BCM) standard, developed to minimise the risks of disruptions, which can impact a business. The standard is designed to keep businesses operational during challenging times by protecting staff, preserving reputations and providing the ability to keep trading. Interxion’s development of a BCM system involved integrating with the already established Information Security Management System, ISO 27001, an internationally recognised certification designed to assess levels of risk across an entire company’s data centre network.
Awards[edit]
In 2010 Interxion’s Technology and Engineering Group was recognised for its “Outstanding Contribution to the Data Centre Sector”[13] at the sixth annual Data Centre Europe awards ceremony held at Espaces Antipolis in Nice, France. Interxion was nominated in the Green I.T. Awards 2011 as a finalist for “IT Operator of the Year”.[14]
Memberships[edit]
Interxion is a member of the following organisations:

RIPE[15]
Euro-IX[16]
Irish Internet Association[17]
The Green Grid – Contributor Member[18]
The Green Grid – Advisory Council[19]
The Uptime Institute[20]

Colocation services[edit]
Security[edit]
Interxion data centre buildings are typically designed with five layers of physical security: the perimeter fence, the security gate and entrance, mantraps into the data centre, access systems into the rooms and secure, locked cabinets. Clients can introduce additional levels, such as lockable cages or cubes (containment aisles), as required. No one enters or leaves the data centre without proof of identity, such as national ID, passport or driving license; and all visitors are checked against customer-defined access lists. There are multiple physical security layers, including CCTV, man traps and 24x7 controlled access. All building areas are secured by an alarm system, and an external security firm patrols the area, both inside and outside. Interxion utilises ISO 27001-certified information security management systems.[citation needed]
Power[edit]
Interxion provides managed power with resilience built in all the way to the cabinet and server if required and a minimum N+1 configuration on power infrastructure with facilities such as high-speed refuelling. The continuously improving design specification supports a modular build, including critical infrastructure. Extra equipment can be added to the infrastructure to increase capacity without causing outages.[citation needed]
Controlled environment[edit]
All equipment is maintained and continuously monitored in a climate-controlled environment. The average temperature inside the cold aisle is controlled between 18 and 25 °C and a humidity level of 50% ± 10%. Multiple air conditioning units provide redundant capacity. Early warning systems installed as standard detect hot spots before they become a problem.[citation needed]
Energy efficiency[edit]
After joining the Green Grid association in 2008[21] and becoming a Contributor Member and part of the Advisory Council, Interxion has committed to continuously investigate efficiency opportunities such as free cooling as standard, ground water cooling, and waste heat re-use. Continuous monitoring and measuring provides information about the environments and enables identification of opportunities to improve efficiency. The flexible design provides a scalable infrastructure model.[22]
Connectivity[edit]
Interxion connects to more than 400 individual carriers and ISPs as well as 18 European Internet exchanges. This is part of the carrier-neutral data centre concept.
Carriers[edit]
Interxion hosts global Tier 1, regional Tier 2 and national Tier 3 networks with direct access to the backbone infrastructure and PoP’s for over 400 carriers across its European footprint. These carriers are present at Interxion’s data centres both to interconnect to other carriers but also to take advantage of the customer communities within the data centres.
Internet exchanges[edit]
Internet exchanges are the major points on the Internet where networks interconnect. They serve as an exchange point for the traffic of the Internet via bi-lateral, settlement-free peering agreements. Interxion houses 18 such Internet exchanges in Europe. Interxion is an active supporter of the public Internet exchanges and was an active participant in the creation of Euro-IX.

In Copenhagen we’ve built a unique cooling system. With it we utilise two reservoirs, 70m below ground, in subterranean limestone deposits where water is cooled naturally to 10-11°C.
With this solution we exploit the natural cooling potential of the water to reduce the load on our chillers. The reduced chiller burden means we make energy savings of more than 1,200 MWh every year. We also use 100 percent renewable energy in Denmark and Sweden.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
