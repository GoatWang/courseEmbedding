History[edit]
Deluxe Corporate was founded as Deluxe Check Printers in 1915 by W.R. Hotchkiss in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Hotchkiss was the creator of some important, speed-enhancing inventions, which included the Hotchkiss Imprinting Press (patented in 1925), a two-way perforator (perfected in 1925), and the Hotchkiss Lithograph Press (patented in 1928). He is also the creator of the first personal flat-pocket checkbook and holder.[6] Deluxe was originally a check printing company, but experienced bottom-up innovation in the early 1900s and expanded into customer service for businesses.[7]
In 1952, the Deluxe Corporation Foundation was created to contribute to charitable organizations.[8] The company was privately held until 1965, by which time it was a pioneer in the new MICR check printing technology.[9] By the 1980s, the company was facing reduced demand for its products and increasing competition.[10] In 1988 the company incorporated and changed its name to Deluxe Corporation.[11]
Deluxe shifted its focus from printing products to primarily business services in 2008.[12] It launched an employee background-screening service called HireRight and expanded its service offerings through acquisitions.[12] This included the purchase of Hostopia (web hosting), Logo Mojo (logo design), and PartnerUp (market intelligence).[12] Deluxe continued expanding in 2011 with the acquisitions of online printing service PsPrint and web-based marketing firm OrangeSoda.[6]

History[edit]
Deluxe Corporate was founded as Deluxe Check Printers in 1915 by W.R. Hotchkiss in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Hotchkiss was the creator of some important, speed-enhancing inventions, which included the Hotchkiss Imprinting Press (patented in 1925), a two-way perforator (perfected in 1925), and the Hotchkiss Lithograph Press (patented in 1928). He is also the creator of the first personal flat-pocket checkbook and holder.[6] Deluxe was originally a check printing company, but experienced bottom-up innovation in the early 1900s and expanded into customer service for businesses.[7]
In 1952, the Deluxe Corporation Foundation was created to contribute to charitable organizations.[8] The company was privately held until 1965, by which time it was a pioneer in the new MICR check printing technology.[9] By the 1980s, the company was facing reduced demand for its products and increasing competition.[10] In 1988 the company incorporated and changed its name to Deluxe Corporation.[11]
Deluxe shifted its focus from printing products to primarily business services in 2008.[12] It launched an employee background-screening service called HireRight and expanded its service offerings through acquisitions.[12] This included the purchase of Hostopia (web hosting), Logo Mojo (logo design), and PartnerUp (market intelligence).[12] Deluxe continued expanding in 2011 with the acquisitions of online printing service PsPrint and web-based marketing firm OrangeSoda.[6]

Great Designers, price and outcome...


                "After search and even buying some logos from other companies and not being satisfied, I felt I needed to keep trying. When owning your own company, the logo should represent not only the product but the owner itself. Deluxe nailed it! I feel they really listened and assisted me in achieving the style and look I want to represent our Sweets company. I am glad I did not give up looking. Great artist!"

                I would never recommend anyone use Deluxe. I spent about $2000.00 and received an app that I cannot even upload. They told me they could do everything and the first design of the website was so bad anyone could find a template that looked better. Then when I told them that was not what I wanted they said they could not do what they said they could when I signed up and would not give me a refund. Total waste of money.

Highly recommend


                "As a 2nd time business owner over the course of my professional career, having a team of ppl that are understanding to your brand (both as a business and a person) is not always easy to find. It took several attempts to create the perfect logo for my company, however, I really appreciated the patience, care, and understanding of each person I worked with to ensure I had my vision come to life. Every business needs to understand this level of service (especially when building a vision through someone else and having to deliver). Very talented designers, very respectful designers, and very open to constructive feedback designers. It makes a very rewarding and winning relationship! I am beyond happy with my custom logo and I cannot thank the Deluxe team enough!"

Beautiful work with a lot of hidden fees and dilatory


                Pros: beautiful work and polite staff.Cons: I paid an extra almost $200 to rush my order on top of $900 package I chose. However, things were still slow. - Everytime they said it takes it takes 2-4 days to finalize some files; it took a week. In fact, I had to email and asked why they took so long. It's been a month and I still do not have my business card printed. - They said they're not responsible for defects like small points or small lines in the final printed products. They're not responsible if the product color does not look the same. This is ridiculous since they are the one who designs and prints their own products but they are not responsible for their finished outcome. - Hidden fees are everywhere.  I purchased the top package which in included business card  printed, and as things were progressing, there were fees that they did not tell me up front. It was too late for me withdraw since I already paid almost $1000. I had  to pay extra $35 to have the back side of the card done differently because what they offered in my original package was totally plain. Then I waited another 6 days to hear from them. Then paid $29 for shipping which takes 5-6 days to ship, on top of 3-5 printing days. What the heck?- My business has been pending on thier dilatory. I feel helpless and waste of time and money.

                When I contacted Deluxe I expected the "business as usual" interaction. I was amazingly surprised. I was contacted almost immediately. The phone conversation was pleasant, informative and productive. The staff member was friendly, professional and very knowledgeable. The interactions during the development were extremely helpful. Everyone I dealt with was friendly and professional. The experience was great. I would recommend Deluxe to anyone needing graphic arts and logo design work.

Nahi Warrior logo


                "Deluxe s a great way to design your logo. I was first interviewed on my concept. Then we continued through several meetings as the design process took place. We ended with an amazing logo that encompasses all that I desired. I have been in business for 13 years. I travel around the world with yoga, coaching, inspiration, and am a best selling author. This rebrand was done to link all of the past and bring forward the Nahi Wellness lifestyle brand. I am extremely happy with the product and care that was done to hold something so dear to me with love. Thank you and if you are looking for your logo go for it! Peace, Sid McNairy"

                This was a wonderful experience...both collaborative and efficient. I loved the ability to tweak the design multiple times during the development process. When asking for assistance the Deluxe team was quick to respond. I had two logos developed and both came out exceptional. Thank you Deluxe for your support!

Idiots. No really, they are idiots.


                Has anybody received an email from DeluxeHosting.com?  Their emails are formatted with all kinds of special characters included in the text and you have to spend time deciphering and then talking to them on the phone is even worse. Supervisors act like you're wasting their time.

Endless Solicitations


                I purchased checks for my small business from Deluxe in 2014.  In 2015, I went to electronic means of payment.  I contacted Deluxe and requested to be taken off their mailing list.  Since that time, I have received endless solicitations from them for my old business and new online businesses I started.  Since 2014, I have contacted Customer Service no less than 10 times requesting the solicitations to stop.  Each time, I was reassured that they would end and they simply didn't.  I now have solicitations going to my old addresses opening the door to identity theft.  When I have called Deluxe, the Customer Service Agents continually try to reassure me that there is no way anyone could order checks in my name.  Having been a police officer, I know that is highly untrue. Apparently, they are ignorant to the fact that it is one of the major reasons why the majority of transactions are now electronic.  I will never use any of this company's services again.

Great First impression turned out to be WRONG


                Worked with this company to design a new logo for my corporation. Logo design was good and liked the company. I then began to order more products from them and they failed to listen and tailor the product design to my needs. I then got so fed up I requested a refund. Four months later, and four request for refunds later and I'm still waiting for.

Fraud


                I paid $300 to have this company help set up promos and work on my website to gain more traffic. In that three months absolutely NOTHING happened. I had to be the one to continuously contact them for reports. I ended up promoting myself on Craigslist and door to door ads and gained my own clients. They just take your money and honestly, they do nothing but dweedle their thumbs and make horrible clip art promos.Its not right or okay to steal from a small business owner and I will continue to spread the word about your horrible services or lack there of.

Completely satisfied


                The team of designers created logos options that met my requirements.  Revisions were done promptly.  Very happy with the end product.

Stale logo design.  2 Months Later and Still No Refund.  DON'T USE!


                I started the $395 logo design process with Deluxe on 8/4/16.  I received some stale looking logo concepts that I didn't like so I turned to someone else to come up with some new concepts.  I sent Deluxe these newer concepts so they wouldn't think I was stealing any of their stale ideas and they sent me a refund request which states, "your refund will be processed in 15 business days".  Two months and several communications later, I am still awaiting my refund.  They shouldn't offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee if they have no plan on honoring it.

There's a lot of wildlife nearby the location since it's near the woods.ConsWhere to start??Deluxe has so many cons to it, so I am only going to list the major ones.Almost everyone I work with daily is completely incompetent. No one seems to understand how to use English properly to convey their messages so I am stuck trying to interpret what they mean. And trying to decipher emails is a joke. If you ask a question in an email, good luck getting an answer. You'll probably just get another question as a response and the question will have nothing to do with your original question.Most women end every sentence with an inflection so it sounds like they are asking a question when they aren't. No fault of their own though. If you are a woman at Deluxe and you are "perceived" to be rude then you are a horrible person in everyone's eyes. You must maintain the appearance and perception of being super nice and motherly. Speaking of motherly, if you don't have kids expect to treated differently. Your time no longer matters. You have zero responsibilities outside of work since you don't have kids so expect to work longer hours because of your life choices. Men don't have it easy either. They have to be nice but still firm. And into sports.People will try to sell you things at work. Many people there cannot afford to live on the measly pay they get and have been sucked into pyramid schemes in order to make ends meet. You feel guilty not buying stuff from your coworkers but you can barely afford your own rent.HR is completely incompetent and doesn't give a crap about you. You tell them something important or time sensitive and they act like you just said "what's up?" And they do not understand their job is very private. Don't leave employees personal files out when you're meeting with a different employee.Do you like food? If so, bring your own. Their idea of a cafeteria is gas station food. No real food anymore. Prepackaged food like items to consume at extremely high prices. Who would pay $8 for packaged soup?! I can get soup cheaper at Walmart.And if you don't like being micromanaged, don't work here. Your boss will be on you all the time. I get they have metrics to meet, but if I'm sick and can't afford to take a sick day because I don't want to use PTO, don't get mad because I had to use the restroom more often that day. Yes, I know my adherence was off but I don't care. I cared more about not vomiting in front of my coworkers or on the phone with a customer. Next time, I will not be so courteous.And if you want a place to advance your career, look somewhere else. They act like you can advance quickly. Even the trainers say they advanced quickly but they must be a fluke. Most people make lateral moves not getting much, if any, of a raise. And they now have these extra jobs you can do which will provide more OJT for more experience. Like onboarding mentor. Really?! You don't pay more but expect me to do more.Also a very unethical company. Will punish people for being out sick even though you're not supposed to do that. Will fire people for not showing up for work because they were in the hospital.Advice to ManagementStop paying the CEO millions of dollars each year. Stop paying the higher ups (VP and such) so much money. Maybe you could use that extra money to actually improve the moral of your employees. There is no fun at work anymore. I used to enjoy coming into work and after a couple years I just felt like I was slave.Also, fire everyone who is VP level and up and get new blood in the door. People who are either younger, know how profitable businesses work, or both. There are too many people who are stuck in the 80's way of running a business and just read books on how to improve things. Books aren't going to get you to where you need to be. Take action. Make a big change.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Deluxe Corporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Deluxe Corporation 2017-07-12 18:01 PDT Jul 11, 2017 Helpful (1)"High Pressure and Fear Tactics are the Culture Here"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Sales Consultant in Shoreview, MNCurrent Employee - Sales Consultant in Shoreview, MNDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at Deluxe Corporation full-time (More than 3 years)ProsGood benefits. Large, well-maintained parking lotConsDeluxe has resorted to publicly humiliating struggling employees in a centrally located "Pod", where everyone walks by. It's basically where they send you before they fire you. Deluxe coaches are now telling sales employees to be aggressive and to make the customer feel guilty if they do not place an order. Sales goals are becoming increasingly difficult, and expectations are becoming unreasonable.Deluxe used to have a rewards-based, positive culture, but has shifted radically to a pressure and fear-based culture. A new site leader was brought on at one of the sites in Minnesota, and his background is debt collection. Keep in mind he is now in charge of a sales center, and he has sent out many threatening emails telling us that he "doesn't do nice", and how we've received our "fair warning".Employees are told that they are replaceable and they will find someone else sitting at their desk if they do not perform at the constantly increasing standards.It's no surprise that attrition is out-of-control at Deluxe.They used to have a cafeteria with freshly-prepared meals to order, and a great salad bar, and have closed it. Deluxe does not feel that it's employees deserve a decent, affordable meal.The high stress has caused some employees to develop stress-related medical conditions. No job is worth sacrificing your health for.The promise of advancement is an illusion. What Deluxe calls a promotion often means more responsibility at the same rate of pay.Stay away, you can find a company who respects and values it's people. Deluxe is borderline unethical in it's treatment of it's employees. Deluxe has created the most toxic work environment I have ever been in.Advice to ManagementIt's not too late to fix this, but it ALL has to change. The fear and threats need to go.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Deluxe Corporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Deluxe Corporation 2017-07-11 07:44 PDT Jun 15, 2017"Customer service/Sales"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Customer Service Representative in Colorado Springs, COFormer Employee - Customer Service Representative in Colorado Springs, CORecommendsPositive OutlookI worked at Deluxe Corporation full-time (More than a year)ProsGreat benefits , good working conditions . career opportunities , job securityConsdifficult to feel part of the team, low salaryAdvice to ManagementDon't be so aloof from the employees, get off the pedestal, and encourage others for advancementShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Deluxe Corporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Deluxe Corporation 2017-06-15 06:21 PDT May 20, 2017 Helpful (3)"Good Place to Work!"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Website Coordinator in Shoreview, MNCurrent Employee - Website Coordinator in Shoreview, MNI have been working at Deluxe Corporation full-time (More than a year)ProsGreat benefits, awesome job facilities and a strong, supportive HR department make Deluxe a good place to work.ConsManagement is emerging from a long period of institutional calcification, but it's still pretty restrictive without much rise-from-within opportunities. Also, part of that heritage of calcification includes a very competitive, us-vs.-them mentality between departments, which makes multi-team projects across various departments rather difficult.Advice to ManagementKeep moving in the direction of inclusivity and recognizing the important of multi-departmental cooperation.

I've seen managers talk about things, one will ask the other a yes/no question and the other manager will just flat refuse to take a side on the issue for fear of the consequences. This rarely makes it below management but it's got to be killing the managers and will ultimately trickle down.Advice to ManagementIt's better to stand up to the people above you and look for a new job than it is to be spineless and shift blame constantly. That's the only advice I could give, if anyone bothered to do this it wouldn't take long to fix long standing issues.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Deluxe Corporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Deluxe Corporation 2017-05-31 13:23 PDT Showing 358 of 364 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12345NextReviews > Deluxe Corporation RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountReviews by Job TitleCustomer Service Representative (14) Account Executive (7) Manager (7) Inside Sales Representative (6) Inside Sales (5) Director (5) Sales & Service Representative (5) Human Resources (3) Marketing Manager (3) Marketing (3) Sales (3) Sales Service Representative (3) Sales Consultant (2) Universal Associate (2) Logo Artist (2) Show MoreShow LessCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompany Updates Deluxe teams up with LeBron James to help local small businesses in Cleveland.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
