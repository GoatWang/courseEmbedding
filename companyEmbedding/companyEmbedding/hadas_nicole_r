Akebia Therapeutics Strengthens Its Leadership Team with Key Additions | Business Wire
























































Akebia Therapeutics Strengthens Its Leadership Team with Key Additions






January 13, 2014 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Akebia Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the 
      development of novel proprietary therapeutics based on hypoxia-inducible 
      factor biology and the commercialization of these products for patients 
      with kidney disease, today announced that it has strengthened its 
      leadership team with two hires. Nicole R. Hadas has joined Akebia as 
      Vice President and General Counsel, and Michel Dahan as Vice President, 
      Commercial.
    


      “Nikki and Michel will be instrumental to our team as we advance our 
      portfolio of drug candidates, including AKB-6548, a once-daily oral 
      therapy currently in a Phase 2b study for the treatment of anemia 
      associated with chronic kidney disease who are not dependent on 
      dialysis” said John P. Butler, Chief Executive Officer of Akebia. “The 
      new additions bring invaluable and diverse experiences to the Company 
      and will build upon the established strengths and expertise of the 
      leadership team” added Mr. Butler.
    

      Nikki Hadas joined Akebia as Vice President and General Counsel in 2013. 
      Prior to Akebia, Ms. Hadas served as the Senior Vice President and 
      General Counsel at Inspiration Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., where she 
      managed the successful sale of its hemophilia assets to Cangene 
      Corporation and Baxter International. From 2001 to 2011, Ms. Hadas 
      worked at Genzyme Corporation, most recently as Senior Corporate 
      Counsel. Prior to Genzyme, she was an associate at Foley Hoag 
      representing biopharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers. Ms. 
      Hadas received a B.A. from the University of Michigan and a J.D. from 
      Boston College Law School.
    

      Michel Dahan joined Akebia as Vice President, Commercial in 2013 to lead 
      global marketing and commercialization activities. Prior to joining 
      Akebia, Mr. Dahan led global marketing and commercial development at 
      Inspiration Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., preparing for two global launches 
      and ultimately for the sale of its assets to Cangene Corporation and 
      Baxter International and, prior to that, global marketing and strategic 
      planning for the hemophilia franchise at Ipsen. He began his career in 
      mergers and acquisitions and in corporate business development for the 
      biopharmaceutical industry. He earned his graduate degree in business 
      administration at HEC Paris (France), his ‘maitrise’ in mathematics from 
      University Paris VI (France), and completed his executive education 
      program at Harvard Business School.
    

      In addition, Akebia is strengthening its finance team. Kristie A. 
      Bolieau has joined the company as Vice President, Corporate Controller. 
      Ms. Bolieau brings more than 20 years of expertise with diverse 
      leadership roles in financial management, accounting and reporting and 
      internal controls. Prior to Akebia, Ms. Bolieau served as Director, 
      Assistant Controller of athenahealth, Inc., a healthcare business 
      services company. Ms. Bolieau spent 17 years at GTC Biotherapeutics, 
      Inc., a spin-out of Genzyme Corporation, where she served in various 
      financial roles of progressive responsibility, most recently as Vice 
      President, Finance and Accounting/Assistant Treasurer. Ms. Bolieau holds 
      a B.S. from North Adams State College and an M.B.A. from Suffolk 
      University and is a Certified Public Accountant in the Commonwealth of 
      Massachusetts. Ms. Bolieau will report to Jason A. Amello, Senior Vice 
      President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
    

About Akebia Therapeutics


      Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the 
      development of novel proprietary therapeutics based on hypoxia-inducible 
      factor biology and the commercialization of these products for patients 
      with kidney disease. The Company’s lead product candidate, AKB-6548, is 
      in a Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with anemia secondary to 
      chronic kidney disease who are not dependent on dialysis. AKB-6548 is 
      being developed as a once-daily oral therapy, which works through the 
      inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase, leading to 
      stabilization and increased levels of HIFα and improved production of 
      hemoglobin and red blood cells.
