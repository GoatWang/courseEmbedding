Welcome to Tower Bridge Advisors

Founded in 2001
Singular focus on providing exceptional investment management
              services to individuals, families and select institutions
Majority owned by employees
10-person investment team, all with extensive research and portfolio management experience managing stocks and bonds
Customized portfolios created to meet each client's needs 
Commitment to outstanding service



            As an employee owned firm, we are guided by one principal–doing what is in the best interest of the client. We do not answer to a corporate parent, nor do we use any investment products that create conflicts of interest or excessive fees for our clients.

Our extensive experience in the investment industry means that we have seen up markets, down markets and everything in between. That experience provides us with the perspective to manage each client’s individual needs in an appropriate fashion.

            The process of working with a client starts with a thorough understanding of their life goals, their risk tolerance and their need for growth and income. Understanding a client’s needs is an ongoing process, so we  continually communicate with our clients about their needs and any changes in their lives.


The Tower Bridge Difference
Tower Bridge Advisors was founded in 2001 with a mission to provide high quality investment advice alongside outstanding client service. We manage equity and fixed income portfolios comprised of individual stocks and bonds. Our clients choose us because of our commitment to investment research, our experience in managing client portfolios and our laser like focus on  our clients' needs. Our ten investment professionals have, on average, more than 25 years’ experience researching investment opportunities, and managing portfolios through up as well as down markets.
Our investment process starts with a clear understanding of each client’s unique financial situation, and takes into account their tax status and tolerance for risk. Only by understanding these factors can we develop an appropriate investment solution.
Our rigorous investment process results in a customized asset allocation for each client. Each client’s portfolio is constructed of 35-40 stocks which represent the best ideas of our investment team, and an appropriate allocation to bonds to achieve the client’s requirement for income and stability.
From a client service standpoint, we make ourselves available for phone calls and in person meetings as frequently as desired. Our clients appreciate talking directly to the person who manages their account, not a marketing person or an intermediary. Our team of experienced administrators also reach out to our clients to ensure proper management of all administrative details of their accounts.

Investment Process
Overview
The Investment process begins with a thorough understanding of each client’s individual situation.  We look at a client’s need for growth and income, their risk tolerance, and their tax situation. Only then are we able to determine the appropriate asset allocation- the mix of stocks and bonds in the portfolio.
Screening Process
Our team of portfolio managers and analysts continually research stocks that fit our stringent criteria.  We start with the universe of companies with $2 billion or more in market capitalization. We then do a quantitative screen for companies with the best growth characteristics and those whose price is below what we calculate to be fair value.  We then do a qualitative screen to assess the management, strategy and growth prospects of these companies.
Model Portfolio
The process results in a “model portfolio” that is comprised of 35-40 stocks.  Statistics show that this allows for ample diversification and reasonable ability to grow the portfolio.  This model portfolio is the basis for the equity portion of a client portfolio.  We also maintain an “approved list” of stocks. These stocks satisfy our quality, growth and valuation criteria and allow portfolio managers to customize the client’s portfolio.
Ongoing Monitoring
We continually monitor the companies we follow, staying abreast of any significant changes that could affect the ability of the stock to reach its price targets.

FAQ's


 






Home > FAQs
FAQs
Q.  How long has Tower Bridge been in business?
A.  The firm was founded in 2001.
Q.  Is Tower Bridge registered with any investment regulatory bodies?
A.  Yes, Tower Bridge is registered with the SEC as a Registered Investment Advisor.  Our form ADV  is filed with the SEC and can be found on our website.
Q.   What differentiates you from your competitors?
A.  There are three key differentiators.  1. As an independent, employee-owned firm, we have no conflicts of interest.  Everything we do is guided by one thing- what is in our clients’ best interests.  2.  Each member of our team of portfolio managers and analysts has, on average, over 25 years’ experience analyzing stocks and building client portfolios.  Experience brings great perspective to the investment process.  3.  We are committed to outstanding client service.  We pride ourselves on our robust communication with clients through whatever means works best for them—phone calls, emails or in-person meetings.
Q.  What is your investment style?
A.  On the equity side we manage growth stocks, but with a value tilt.  That means we buy stocks that have better than average growth characteristics, but we are not willing to overpay for them.  For fixed income investing, we believe in buying high quality corporates, as well as government, agency and muni bonds.  We generally do not buy bond funds. 
Q.  What are the qualifications of your Investment Staff?
A.  Our Investment Staff is comprised of 8 portfolio managers and 2 analysts.   Six of those individuals are CFA Charterholders and six also have MBA degrees.  Their backgrounds include experience as sell side analysts for investment firms and large fund companies. 
Q.  How much money do you manage?
A.   $1.2 Billion (as of quarter ending 12/31/2016)
Q.  What is your minimum investment amount?
A.  Our minimum investment size is $1 Million.  It becomes challenging to truly customize a portfolio at smaller asset sizes. 
Q.  How do you service your clients?
A.  We assign two portfolio managers to every client relationship, in addition to an account administrator.  We communicate with clients as frequently as they would like, whether over the phone, in person or via email.  We also send clients a brief market commentary 3 times per week, and offer educational web seminars on a monthly basis. 
Q.  What geography do you cover?
A.  We have clients spread out across the country.  Particularly with today’s electronic communication, we are able to service clients regardless of location.
Q.  Do you work with Investment Advisors?
A.  Tower Bridge has a number of relationships with investment advisors who utilize us for our asset management skills, while they oversee the overall client relationship.  We work with these advisors to develop a communication plan that satisfies the client’s needs and keeps the advisor front and center in the relationship. 
Q.  Where would my assets be held?
A.  Tower Bridge is not a custodian and does not physically handle client assets.  We work with a number of reputable third party custodians to house client assets. This provides our clients with another level of comfort that their assets are secure, and that our only interest is in providing quality investment advice.
Q.  How do you charge for your services?
A.  Tower Bridge receives a fee based on a percentage of assets under management.  This is our only fee since we do not sell any products nor provide other services, such as custody. 
Q.  How do I find out if Tower Bridge can help with my investments?
A.  Contact Nick Filippo via phone or email, or fill out the contact form on our website.  We will be happy to meet with you to understand your situation and your concerns, and together we can determine whether Tower Bridge would be a good fit.
Q.  Are there any fees or consulting charges associated with an initial conversation?
A.  No.  We are always interested in meeting with prospective clients to see if there is a good personal fit and if we can help them with their investment needs. 
Q.  I am not satisfied with my current Investment firm.  How easy is it to switch to Tower Bridge?
A.  The process is typically very straightforward.  Our account administrators put together the appropriate paperwork to open an account and manage all the details. 
Q.  What kind of reporting do you provide to clients?
A.  Each quarter Tower Bridge provides a comprehensive report which includes detail about holdings, transactions, gains and losses, and performance.  The report includes  graphs that make it easy to read and understand.  
Q.  I work closely with an estate planning attorney and an accountant who prepares my taxes.  How would Tower Bridge work with these professionals?
A.  We work with many attorneys and accountants to ensure that they are aware of how your funds are invested.  Likewise, we need to be sure we understand your estate plan and tax situation, as that may impact the way we manage your portfolio.  We can also provide your attorney or accountant with copies of your statements if you wish for us to do so.

Benefits of A Separately Managed Account
                
Separately managed accounts are a terrific alternative to today’s “packaged products” with many benefits to the client and the advisor. Separately managed accounts allow you to:
                  
Customize portfolios based on client needs
Actively manage tax impact
Have direct access to the portfolio manager who is making the investment decisions
Provide clients with total transparency - they can see precisely which securities they own
Provide clients with professional management at a better price than most funds or other packaged products










Home >  How We Work with Financial Advisors
Financial Advisors

Shared Goals
As a separate account manager, we have developed relationships with a number of investment advisors who focus on gathering assets and servicing their clients, utilizing the professionals at Tower Bridge to manage the investment process. We and our advisor partners share the same objective—to provide outstanding service in helping clients reach their financial goals.
Client Service
            Although we manage the client’s assets, we work with the financial advisor to determine the level of involvement by Tower Bridge that is appropriate for each client. We are happy to take an active role to assist the advisor in working with the client if desired.  We recognize that the financial advisor is an important client to Tower Bridge.          
Value Add
            We believe that we can enhance the value the advisor brings to the table.  And we believe that by associating with a quality firm like Tower Bridge, the advisor can strengthen his or her relationship with the end client. 



Why Tower Bridge
We have one focus, and that is to customize portfolios for the benefit of our clients. We have an experienced team that brings great perspective and expertise to every relationship. And we are committed to the highest level of customer service. We are available to meet with you and your client in person or over the phone and we are willing to meet as frequently as you and your client desire.  We also provide a brief market commentary 3 days per week to keep you and your client up to date on our latest thinking. In addition we offer monthly webinars to provide additional insights into the markets and our thought process.
Our interests are aligned with yours. We want to help your client achieve their goals, and we want them to know that we, like you, are looking out for their best interests at all times.

Welcome to Tower Bridge Advisors

Founded in 2001
Singular focus on providing exceptional investment management
              services to individuals, families and select institutions
Majority owned by employees
10-person investment team, all with extensive research and portfolio management experience managing stocks and bonds
Customized portfolios created to meet each client's needs 
Commitment to outstanding service



            As an employee owned firm, we are guided by one principal–doing what is in the best interest of the client. We do not answer to a corporate parent, nor do we use any investment products that create conflicts of interest or excessive fees for our clients.

Our extensive experience in the investment industry means that we have seen up markets, down markets and everything in between. That experience provides us with the perspective to manage each client’s individual needs in an appropriate fashion.

            The process of working with a client starts with a thorough understanding of their life goals, their risk tolerance and their need for growth and income. Understanding a client’s needs is an ongoing process, so we  continually communicate with our clients about their needs and any changes in their lives.


The Tower Bridge Difference
Tower Bridge Advisors was founded in 2001 with a mission to provide high quality investment advice alongside outstanding client service. We manage equity and fixed income portfolios comprised of individual stocks and bonds. Our clients choose us because of our commitment to investment research, our experience in managing client portfolios and our laser like focus on  our clients' needs. Our ten investment professionals have, on average, more than 25 years’ experience researching investment opportunities, and managing portfolios through up as well as down markets.
Our investment process starts with a clear understanding of each client’s unique financial situation, and takes into account their tax status and tolerance for risk. Only by understanding these factors can we develop an appropriate investment solution.
Our rigorous investment process results in a customized asset allocation for each client. Each client’s portfolio is constructed of 35-40 stocks which represent the best ideas of our investment team, and an appropriate allocation to bonds to achieve the client’s requirement for income and stability.
From a client service standpoint, we make ourselves available for phone calls and in person meetings as frequently as desired. Our clients appreciate talking directly to the person who manages their account, not a marketing person or an intermediary. Our team of experienced administrators also reach out to our clients to ensure proper management of all administrative details of their accounts.
