About Big Bus Tours








Big Bus Tours is the largest operator of open-top sightseeing tours in the world, providing sightseeing tours in 19 cities across three continents.
It was formed by the merger of two established sightseeing tour businesses: the Big Bus Company Ltd (based in London) and Les Cars Rouges (based in Paris). The two businesses, each with over 20 years of successful tour experience, created Big Bus Tours in May 2011. Big Bus was purchased by Exponent LLC a London based private equity partnership in 2015. The Big Bus philosophy is to ‘think global and act local’. “Understanding each city, its character and culture as well as its landmarks is key to our success” commented Pat Waterman, CEO. “We aim to provide exceptional levels of service and a unique sightseeing experience to the millions of customers we receive” every year.
This obligation to deliver a great experience drives us to continually innovate and develop new products and offers.
Big Bus Tours’ sightseeing formula has been designed to provide a flexible approach to city discovery. Each open-top bus tour provides a hop-on, hop-off facility at a variety of interesting locations and, wherever possible, Big Bus Tours looks to enhance the visitor sightseeing experience by providing complementary experiences.

History[edit]

The Big Bus Company first started operating in London, England in June 1991 with four buses by the Maybury family. It later expanded to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Philadelphia, and so on.[3]
In May 2007, the Abu Dhabi company the Al Fahim Group purchased a 30% shareholding.[4][5] Big Bus Tours was formed in May 2011 when The Big Bus Company of London merged with the Les Cars Rouges Company of Paris.[6]
In February 2015, the business was sold to Exponet Private Equity.[7][8] In February 2016, Merlin Entertainments bought a 15% shareholding.[9]
Overview of operation[edit]
Buses travel near major landmarks around the town or city it tours. Pre-recorded or live commentary about the landscape is provided through small headphones worn by each passenger. Users may leave the bus and board again without limit (hop-on, hop-off) at special bus stops on a circular route. In large cities, buses go on more than one route. In some cities (such as Hong Kong) some variants of the ride include travelling by boat.[10]

History[edit]

The Big Bus Company first started operating in London, England in June 1991 with four buses by the Maybury family. It later expanded to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Philadelphia, and so on.[3]
In May 2007, the Abu Dhabi company the Al Fahim Group purchased a 30% shareholding.[4][5] Big Bus Tours was formed in May 2011 when The Big Bus Company of London merged with the Les Cars Rouges Company of Paris.[6]
In February 2015, the business was sold to Exponet Private Equity.[7][8] In February 2016, Merlin Entertainments bought a 15% shareholding.[9]
Overview of operation[edit]
Buses travel near major landmarks around the town or city it tours. Pre-recorded or live commentary about the landscape is provided through small headphones worn by each passenger. Users may leave the bus and board again without limit (hop-on, hop-off) at special bus stops on a circular route. In large cities, buses go on more than one route. In some cities (such as Hong Kong) some variants of the ride include travelling by boat.[10]

Dennis Condor of Big Bus


Originally, the fleet was built up with former route service double deckers that were converted to open top for a second life. AEC Routemasters, Daimler Fleetlines, Leyland Atlanteans and Leyland Titans were all used during the 1990s. These were replaced by 3-axle Dennis Condors, Leyland Olympians and MCW Metrobuses purchased from Hong Kong. The depot is in Wimbledon.
In 2008, 10 East Lancs Visionaire bodied Volvo B9TLs were purchased. These were followed by 26 Optare Visionaire-bodied Volvo B9TLs and 3-axle Ankais.

History[edit]




Big Bus company kiosk and bus queue at Speakers' Corner, London


The Big Bus Company first started operating in London, England in June 1991 with four buses by the Maybury family. It later expanded to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Philadelphia, and so on.[3]
In May 2007, the Abu Dhabi company the Al Fahim Group purchased a 30% shareholding.[4][5] Big Bus Tours was formed in May 2011 when The Big Bus Company of London merged with the Les Cars Rouges Company of Paris.[6]
In February 2015, the business was sold to Exponet Private Equity.[7][8] In February 2016, Merlin Entertainments bought a 15% shareholding.[9]
Overview of operation[edit]
Buses travel near major landmarks around the town or city it tours. Pre-recorded or live commentary about the landscape is provided through small headphones worn by each passenger. Users may leave the bus and board again without limit (hop-on, hop-off) at special bus stops on a circular route. In large cities, buses go on more than one route. In some cities (such as Hong Kong) some variants of the ride include travelling by boat.[10]
