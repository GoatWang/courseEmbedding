Biography
For his clients, Michael Piper draws upon his experience in all areas of intellectual property law and his leadership efforts for the firm and recent efforts on the Board of the American Intellectual Property Law Association to provide effective “in-house counsel” guidance from their outside counsel. The goal is to deliver key value in alignment with the business objectives of the client rather than pursuing legal options strictly on their own merits. In support of the clients’ business goals, Mr. Piper currently spends much of his time in development and management of IP and patent portfolios and oversight of preparation and prosecution as well as counseling and representation to achieve successful resolution or avoidance of IP conflicts for his clients. In his leadership roles, Mr. Piper practices the art of consensus building through careful listening, patient but persistent engagement, and innovative solutions to achieve desired results. 
Mr. Piper has dealt extensively with the preparation and prosecution of U.S. and foreign patent applications, the preparation of legal opinions, and the litigation of patents, with particular emphasis on telecommunications products and services and supporting software and infrastructure, computer enterprise architecture and middleware solutions and processes, enterprise security and vulnerability software, search software, and other software generally, oilfield technology, computer and electronic components, chemical processes and products, and mechanical technology in general. Mr. Piper has also had significant experience in trademarks, trade secrets, and copyrights including litigation, registration, prosecution, and counseling. A primary focus of Mr. Piper's in-house experience was the evaluation and negotiation of various IP agreements, including software and patent licenses, and key IP provisions in other agreements, including merger and sale agreements both by asset transfer and sale of stock. Mr. Piper is a founder of the Firm's Dallas office.
Mr. Piper has been active in the leadership of the American Intellectual Property Law Association, an approximately 15,000 member bar organization of IP practitioners. In addition to his recent role on the Board of Directors, he helped start the AIPLA Online Programs Committee and received the AIPLA President's Award for Outstanding Service for 2006 for those efforts. He was also the founding chair of the Public Education Committee which is at the forefront of the challenging but important goal of finding ways to deepen and enlighten the public’s understanding of the value of Intellectual Property system to our everyday lives including its historic origins in our constitution, and its continuing significance to the economic and innovative success of our nation.
 Prior to joining the Firm, Mr. Piper had previously enjoyed working in a variety of Intellectual Property practices, from a small boutique to a large general firm in private practice, to time spent as an in-house IP counsel with ARCO. Mr. Piper attended Texas A&M University where he received his B.S. in mechanical engineering, with University Honors in 1991. He received his Doctor of Jurisprudence with honors in 1994 from the University Of Texas School Of Law. While at the University of Texas, Mr. Piper was one of the founding members of the Texas Intellectual Property Law Journal and served as its Technical Editor.

  Missionary biographies often inspire enthusiasm, zeal, and urgency for missions among God's people. But how do Christians give their lives to missions if they feel called to remain in their homeland? In 1792, British pastor Andrew Fuller formed the Baptist Missionary Society, an organization dedicated to the promotion of mission work both at home and overseas. In this concise biography, best-selling author John Piper introduces readers to this incredible Christian who-although he never served abroad himself-inspired the modern missionary movement that gave rise to such figures as William Carey and Hudson Taylor. Working tirelessly to raise funds for missionaries in the field and championing the importance of sound doctrine for fruitfulness in missions, Fuller stands as an example to all Christians eager to devote themselves to knowing, guarding, and spreading the true gospel of Jesus Christ to the ends of the earth.

John Piper
John Stephen Piper was born 11 January 1946 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Bill and Ruth Piper. The Pipers soon moved to Greenville, South Carolina, where John spent his growing-up years. His father was an itinerant evangelist who also ministered through international radio and Bible courses. John has written a tribute to his mother, who died in 1974, in the booklet, What's the Difference (Crossway Books, 1990) which is also chapter one of the book, Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (Crossway Books, 1991).

At Wheaton College (1964-68), John majored in Literature and minored in Philosophy. Studying Romantic Literature with Clyde Kilby stimulated the poetic side of his nature and today he regularly writes poems to celebrate special family occasions and rich, biblical truths. At Wheaton John also met Noel Henry whom he married in 1968.

Following college, John completed a Bachelor of Divinity degree at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California (1968-71). While at Fuller, John discovered the writings of Jonathan Edwards.

John did his doctoral work in New Testament Studies at the University of Munich, Munich, West Germany (1971-74). His dissertation, Love Your Enemies, was published by Cambridge University Press and Baker Book House (and is now available through Crossway). Upon completion of his doctorate, he went on to teach Biblical Studies at Bethel College in St. Paul, Minnesota for six years (1974-80).

In 1980, sensing an irresistible call to preach, John became the senior pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he ministered for 33 years, until 2013. Together with his people, John was dedicated to spreading a passion for the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples through Jesus Christ - a mission he continues now for the wider church through the ministry of desiringGod.org. John says of his ministry:
"The ministry of preaching is the central labor of my life. My prayer is that through that ministry and everything else I do the great glory of our God and Savior Jesus Christ would be magnified as more and more people come to live out the obedience of faith more and more deeply."

John is the author of over 50 books and now frequently travels to speak, and writes regularly, through Desiring God.

John and Noel have four sons, a daughter, and twelve grandchildren.

5 CDS, UNABRIDGED. MEDITATIONS ON GOD'S LOVE AS THE GIFT OF HIMSELF










            
                5 Hours And 36 Minutes On 5 CDs
                - Publisher
            
                John Piper writes, "I will tell you what a tragedy is. I will show you how to waste your life. Consider this story from the February 1998 Reader's Digest: A couple 'took early retirement from their jobs in the Northeast five years ago when he was 59 and she was 51. Now they live in Punta Gorda, Florida, where they cruise on their 30-foot trawler, play softball and collect shells. . . .' Picture them before Christ at the great day of judgment: 'Look, Lord. See my shells.' That is a tragedy. "God created us to live with a single passion: to joyfully display his supreme excellence in all the spheres of life. The wasted life is the life without this passion. God calls us to pray and think and dream and plan and work not to be made much of, but to make much of him in every part of our lives." This book is a passionate call for this generation to make their lives count for eternity. John Piper acknowledges that the risks for those who seek to accomplish something in life--risks in relationships for the sake of righteousness and authenticity, risks with money for the cause of the Gospel, and risks in witnessing to the truth and beauty of Christ. Readers will find their passion for the cross of Christ enlarged as a result of reading this book.
                - Publisher
            
                This book is a cry from the heart of John Piper. He is pleading that God himself, as revealed in Christ's death and resurrection, is the ultimate and greatest gift of the gospel. // None of Christ's gospel deeds and none of our gospel blessings are good news except as means of seeing and savoring the glory of Christ. Forgiveness is good news because it opens the way to the enjoyment of God himself. Justification is good news because it wins access to the presence and pleasures of God himself. Eternal life is good news because it becomes the everlasting enjoyment of Christ. // All God's gifts are loving only to the degree that they lead us to God himself. That is what God's love is: his commitment to do everything necessary (most painfully the death of his only Son) to enthrall us with what is most deeply and durably satisfying - namely, himself.

John Piper
John Stephen Piper was born 11 January 1946 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Bill and Ruth Piper. The Pipers soon moved to Greenville, South Carolina, where John spent his growing-up years. His father was an itinerant evangelist who also ministered through international radio and Bible courses. John has written a tribute to his mother, who died in 1974, in the booklet, What's the Difference (Crossway Books, 1990) which is also chapter one of the book, Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (Crossway Books, 1991).

At Wheaton College (1964-68), John majored in Literature and minored in Philosophy. Studying Romantic Literature with Clyde Kilby stimulated the poetic side of his nature and today he regularly writes poems to celebrate special family occasions and rich, biblical truths. At Wheaton John also met Noel Henry whom he married in 1968.

Following college, John completed a Bachelor of Divinity degree at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California (1968-71). While at Fuller, John discovered the writings of Jonathan Edwards.

John did his doctoral work in New Testament Studies at the University of Munich, Munich, West Germany (1971-74). His dissertation, Love Your Enemies, was published by Cambridge University Press and Baker Book House (and is now available through Crossway). Upon completion of his doctorate, he went on to teach Biblical Studies at Bethel College in St. Paul, Minnesota for six years (1974-80).

In 1980, sensing an irresistible call to preach, John became the senior pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he ministered for 33 years, until 2013. Together with his people, John was dedicated to spreading a passion for the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples through Jesus Christ - a mission he continues now for the wider church through the ministry of desiringGod.org. John says of his ministry:
"The ministry of preaching is the central labor of my life. My prayer is that through that ministry and everything else I do the great glory of our God and Savior Jesus Christ would be magnified as more and more people come to live out the obedience of faith more and more deeply."

John is the author of over 50 books and now frequently travels to speak, and writes regularly, through Desiring God.

John and Noel have four sons, a daughter, and twelve grandchildren.
Michael Kramer (Narr)
Michael Kramer has had the pleasure of narrating the works of many wonderful authors. He has received Audiofile magazine's Earphones Award for the Kent Family series by John Jakes and for Alan Fulsom's The Day After Tomorrow. He also narrates books for the Library of Congress's Talking Books Program for the blind and physically handicapped. Kramer also works as an actor in the many theatres of the Washington, D.C. area, where he lives with Kate and their two children, Henry and Vivian.

One simple, transparent pricing





$25
per month, billed annually*





* No Discount Policy
The same pricing applies if you buy 1 license or 1000 licenses. We enforce a strict no discount policy
In the Saas industry, it’s very common that companies do “discount “deals”, “friends deals”. In other words, as a customer, you never know whether you’re getting the better end of the stick. We have decided to be transparent and fair with each one of our customers and implement a strict no discount policy.
This way you know exactly what everyone else pays: the same as you do.

Frequently asked:

Question: I have a complex process. How long does it take to setup Chili Piper?
Answer:   Our app installs in a few clicks. To make sure you have the right settings for everyone in your team, it can take an admin, depending on the team size anything in between 15minutes to 2 hours 

Question: Is training, setup & support included in this price? 
Answer:   Yes! We train and onboard all your users

Question: I have a sales development representative booking for an account executive. Does that count as one license or two?
Answer:   Two. Because you want to make sure you have all the data to track your meetings correctly

Question: Do integrations cost extra?
Answer:   Nope

Question: Can I just do an evaluation?
Answer:  We do not offer free trials because we invest time to make sure you are setup and trained for success. We do offer an opt-out clause. You decide on a time period, for example, one month, and we refund you pro-rata if you decide not to go ahead after that time period. So far no one has opted out 🙂 

Question: Do you offer payment terms? Like Net 30 or quarterly payments? 
Answer:   No. Licenses become active upon upfront payment (we want to focus on improving your process not chasing invoices) 

Question: I see you allow for online booking, email time suggestions, phone booking, live transfers, marketing form integrations and more. Do I have to pay extra for these capabilities?
Answer:   Nope. All is included 

Question: How are you different from Calendly, ScheduleOnce, YouCanBookMe and others?
Answer:   We are obsessed with your effectiveness and provide all the integrations/ triggers and rules you need to close more business. Like reducing no show by half at DiscoverOrg or tripling inbound conversion at PerkBox
