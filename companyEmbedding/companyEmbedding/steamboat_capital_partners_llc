Outstanding Performance Award Winners - Steamboat Capital And Joseph Kinnison | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Outstanding Performance Award Winners - Steamboat Capital And Joseph KinnisonApr. 27, 2015  5:00 AM ET|| Includes: AFAM, LFVNby: SA Product TeamSA Product Team SummaryTwo SA authors highlight how understanding historical dynamics, in this case the sales model of multi-level-marketing companies or the pressures of consolidating industries, can be profitable.Steamboat Capital showed LifeVantage’s precarious future as its multi-level-marketing sales appear to peak.Joseph Kinnison identified Almost Family as the strongest acquirer in an industry ripe for consolidation. Dear readers, This week's Outstanding Performance Awards demonstrate how experience and an eye toward industry dynamics can reveal opportunities. One is a multi-level-marketing firm with a pricey product at distributor apogee. The other is an industry roll up and corporate event thesis. Both cases show the value of experience: in the first case, the knowledge of the historical sales patterns of multi-level-marketing companies; in the second case, knowledge of how value can be created within industries facing consolidation. This week's Outstanding Performance Award winners are:   Steamboat Capital for his short idea on LifeVantage (NASDAQ:LFVN) published December 2013. Return to date: +58%   Joseph Kinnison for his long idea on Almost Family (NASDAQ:AFAM) published April 2014. Return to date: +120%   Both authors have updated their articles with a comment on the original article (here and here). Both articles are part of the SA PRO equity research archive, available exclusively to SA PRO subscribers, but will be made available to all readers for 48 hours in honor of their winning the award. About Steamboat Capital Steamboat Capital Partners was founded in 2012 by Parsa Kiai. Prior to Steamboat, Parsa spent four years as a partner at Sonterra Capital involved in research and the investment process. Before Sonterra, Parsa was an analyst at Perry Capital, where he provided coverage of the energy sector. He worked as an analyst in the investment banking division at Goldman, Sachs & Co and is a graduate of Cornell University. Performance Award Case Study - LifeVantage Steamboat Capital's short thesis on LifeVantage is a classic MLM-at-peak thesis. Multi-level marketing companies, due to their recruitment and direct sales strategy, tend to experience rapid growth as the distributor network is built up. As new distributors realize the difficulty in obtaining new sales and recruits, sales frequently experience a rapid fall off as distributors leave the system. This pattern has been repeated before: Wake Up Now (OTCPK:WORC) peaked in 2014, Blyth's (NYSE:BTH) ViSalus division peaked in 2012, Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing experienced a 2009 peak and, going back further in time, Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) had a "pop and drop," as it is called, in 1985.
 Steamboat established that since Q2 2013, sales growth and distributor count had slowed. The quarter before Steamboat's article, the distributor count flat lined after rapid growth. 

 Given that distributor recruitment is key to growth, this boded poorly for future sales which, as it happens, had already been flat for some 5 quarters previously. Adding to this some basic research regarding the product and Steamboat was able to demonstrate a significant markup, threatening the products' long-term viability. A number of red flags were also identified. First, the legal shell had a mixed history with a very general original purpose of "obtaining capital to take advantage of business opportunities." Secondly, a preponderance of studies backing their products were undertaken and associated with the company's largest personal shareholder. Naturally, this would appear to be a conflict of interest. Third, strong insider selling, including through a tender at $2.45 paid with debt, suggest mixed beliefs, at the very least, in the long-term viability of the business. See the author's update here and take a look at the share price since publication: 

 About Joseph Kinnison Joseph Kinnison has 23 years of experience as a research director and portfolio manager. Most recently, he joined JAG Capital Management, LLC as director of equity research. Kinnison kicked off his time on Seeking Alpha with the following great call on Almost Family and has also achieved strong returns with his long recommendation on Momenta Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:MNTA).
 Performance Award Case Study - Almost Family Joseph Kinnison's long thesis on Almost Family is consolidation and corporate event thesis. The home healthcare industry, he points out, was being targeted for cost reductions by CMS. Kinnison argues that with regulatory costs set to rise and reimbursements set to decline, the industry will likely enter into a consolidation period, some of which had already begun. Jobs had been lost in the industry, congressional staffers projected more losses, and the writing was on the wall. This brings us to Almost Family, whose CEO said in the FY2013 earnings release before Kinnison's article (emphasis added):  We are equally confident that the Company is very well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that will inevitably present themselves over this timeframe. Our development activities over the last half of the year, capped by our significant acquisition of SunCrest in December, demonstrate our strong belief in the future.  Compared to some of its public competitors - like Gentiva Health Services (NASDAQ:GTIV) and LHC Group (NASDAQ:LHCG) - Kinnison established that Almost Family has been the best buyer in the group. Not only did they pay the least for each dollar of sales by a large margin, they also purchased a firm sitting in the sweet spot of growth for the industry. All these items set up an attractive situation, with Kinnison encapsulating the thesis by saying:  Being profitable and having low leverage, AFAM appears to be well positioned to execute a consolidation, especially compared to peer companies. The market share leader, Amedisys (NASDAQ:AMED), is not profitable, and Gentiva, a fellow acquirer, has nearly $1.2 billion in debt, about 4 times their equity.  Adding in a discounted valuation relative to the industry, Kinnison argues, and the roll up candidate was attractive. As the year progressed, there was a multiple expansion in AFAM's stock as their acquisition was integrated adding about 50% to the share price. The stock leaped further following strong Q4 2014 earnings and the announcement of the WillCare acquisition in February. This acquisition, though pricier than their 2014 acquisitions, was still at a discount compared to other acquisitions and further enhanced their strategic position. Have a read of Kinnison's update. Following the most recent acquisition announcement, the stock rallied another 50%+, bringing the final return since the article to 120%:
 

 AFAM data by YCharts Congratulations to this week's winners! Look out for a new pair of Outstanding Performance award winners each Monday. Here's a page with all previous winners. Also, keep an eye out for entries to our latest investment pitch contest on contrarian ideas, and if you're interested, send an entry in! More about Outstanding Performance awards Seeking Alpha aims to help investors outperform the markets. In awarding authors of outstanding stock ideas that played out, we hope contributors will be motivated to share more outstanding long and short ideas with our readers - which benefits everyone. Every week, we'll be searching through our long and short ideas archives looking for outstanding stock ideas that played out, and awarding two $2,500 "Outstanding Performance" prizes. Here's what we'll be looking for:   Performance: Above all, we're looking for ideas that made SA readers money. Risk matters, so we'll be looking at the stock's market cap, sector, etc. as well.  Confluence: Every idea has a thesis. Did the idea play out for the reasons proposed or not?  Compelling: For an idea to be outstanding, it needs to be sufficiently convincing that a reader would have been compelled to take a deeper look at the stock and potentially take a stake. In assessing compellingness, we'll be looking at a number of factors including article comments (how did readers react?), historical performance (does the author have a track record of well-thought-out stock ideas?), voice of expertise (does he/she come across as someone who has unusual insight into the stock?), and how thoroughly the article covered key issues (reasons for market mispricing, catalyst(s), competitive landscape, company management, key risks, etc.). In other words, we'll be looking for the same things readers look for when assessing an idea. 
 To qualify for an award, the idea needs to have been submitted exclusively to Seeking Alpha. We will also be asking award winners to publish an update to their thesis, either as a comment to the article or as a standalone article. Generally, we'll be looking for longer-term ideas that offered meaningful upside to readers. We'll be going back as far as two years or even further. We may also reward ideas that played out outstandingly over a shorter timeframe. But we will not be using Outstanding Performance awards to reinforce extreme short-term price volatility. To get exclusive access to these articles after they are selected, as well as early and archival access to many of our top performing ideas, subscribe to SA PRO. We'll be announcing Outstanding Performance award winners in Wall Street Breakfast, in the Today in SA PRO newsletter, and in a standalone article like this one.

Steamboat Capital Partners launches on Sciens MAP

Launches & Fundraising











Steamboat Capital Partners has launched its event-driven, long-short strategy on the Sciens Managed Account Platform. Steamboat is a fundamental, value oriented investment firm that specialises in undervalued and catalyst driven investments.
The vehicle on the Sciens Managed Account Platform follows an opportunistic investment strategy primarily in US listed equity and debt securities across the market capitalisation spectrum, industry sectors and capital structures, with a focus on capital preservation. The strategy is deploying minimal leverage and has a long term investment horizon. The portfolio is concentrated in high conviction ideas on both the long and the short sides.
 
The strategy is being led by Parsa Kiai, Steamboat’s Portfolio Manager. Since the inception of the strategy in July 2012, it has generated an annualised return of over 19 per cent with a Sharpe ratio of 3.2 and volatility of 6 per cent.
 
Kiai says: “While we are pleased with our current portfolio, we continue to see interesting opportunities on both the long and short sides. At this point, the pipeline of ideas on the short side of the portfolio has become particularly rich. We think a number of these opportunities may bear fruit in the coming quarters.”
 
John Rigas, CEO, and Ioannis Bitsios, Portfolio Manager, of Sciens Capital, say: “We are delighted to announce the launch of the SGAS PCC Ltd – Scarlet Omega (Steamboat) Cell on our managed account platform. The strategy has generated very strong risk-adjusted returns since inception, with alpha from both the long and the short sides of the portfolio. Significant outperformance in periods of equity market turmoil and a differentiated stock selection process with limited position overlap with other hedge funds has led to relatively low correlation to equity markets and peers.
 
“We are excited about growing our relationship with Steamboat Capital given their proven record of superior stock selection and alpha generation and their ability to capture opportunities in the event driven space and benefit from increased levels of corporate activity in North America.”
 
The Guernsey Managed Account Platform was launched in November 2001, and has recently been enhanced with a fully compliant AIFMD platform based in Ireland. Sciens remains true to its goal of discovering and launching high quality emerging managers who are on the path to become the next big name of the future.
