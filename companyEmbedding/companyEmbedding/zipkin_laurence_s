Professional Profile

Laurence S. Zipkin, Principal
view profile on LinkedIn


Laurence S. Zipkin is nationally recognized for his expertise in the gaming industry, restaurants, and emerging small growth companies.  As an investment banker, he has been very successful in raising capital for various early growth-stage companies and advising clients regarding capital-raising transactions, including private placements, initial public offerings, mergers, debt offerings, bridge and bank financings, developing business plans and evaluating cash needs and resources.  He has extensive experience in the merger and acquisition field and has represented companies on both the buy and sell sides. 
From 1987 until selling the firm in 2004, Mr. Zipkin served as CEO at Oak Ridge Financial Services Group, Inc. (formerly known as Equity Securities Investments, Inc.). In the 1990s he was instrumental in making the firm a nationally recognized name in gaming and restaurants. Mr. Zipkin is still consulted regularly by companies in the gaming and restaurant industries concerning financial needs and opportunities available to them.  

For the past four years, Mr. Zipkin has focused his business expertise in the area of
Student Housing. These investments represent approximately $140 million in value and
approximately 2700 beds.

Additionally, Mr. Zipkin formed SKRP Properties LLC to acquire Journey Home, an
addiction recovery center for women and their children in Sauk Rapids, Minnesota.


Mr. Zipkin recognized in the late 1980s that Native American gaming was a growth industry, and he was the underwriter for the first Native American public company, Grand Casino.  Grand Casino ultimately was purchased by Hilton Hotels, and the Native American portion was spun off into Lakes Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq: LACO), which merged with Golden Gaming (Nasdaq: GDEN).  He followed this highly successful offering with several other gaming-related companies: Gaming Corp. of America, Isle of Capri, Casino Data Systems, Mississippi Development Corp., Game Financial, Canterbury Park Holdings, Stratosphere Hotel and Casino, Reno Air, Kids Quest (daycare for casino employees), Casino Hospitality Corp. and American Wagering. 

His expertise also extends to the restaurant industry.  He took Champps Americana public in an IPO for $7 million.  Champps ultimately was acquired by Daka in a $25 million transaction in which Equity Securities assisted.  Zipkin was the lead underwriter for a $9 million IPO for Rainforest Restaurant.  This concept ultimately was sold to the Landry's Restaurant Group.  He was also one of the co-underwriters for Famous Dave's restaurants, which now has more than 200 outlets.  On the private side, he raised $12 million for Oceanaire, a high-end national seafood chain.   

Mr. Zipkin was also underwriter for several other IPOs, including:



GIII, a national leather manufacturer and importer.

	Wilson's, The Leather Experts, at the time the largest retailer of leather in the country.

	Rimage, Inc., a maker of floppy and compact disks.

	Mercury Waste Solutions, a toxic-waste-disposal company.

	Realco, Inc., a real-estate investment company.

	ChoiceTel Communications, a pay-phone provider that ultimately was sold.

	Medical CV, a maker of heart valves.

	Kulhman, Inc., a chain of men's shirt stores. 


Mr. Zipkin attended the University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School of Finance.
