You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.

Endorsements

Our efforts and reputation have been acknowledged through endorsements we have received, both written and verbally. Below are excerpts from some of those endorsements.

“I want to take this time to thank you for your company’s cooperation on a very difficult project.  Not only is this project one of a kind, your staff and subs have worked through a very difficult event schedule.”
Patrick A. Tobler, President
The Tobler Company

“As you know Mike the Tiger has been a symbol of LSU for many years and this year he is finally getting a long awaited new home.  Gibbs Construction has done an outstanding job in giving Mike a first class habitat”
David W. Burton
Development Office
Special Events & Chapter Programs
Tiger Athletic Foundation

“It has been a pleasure working with your company on W. Smith, Jr. Elementary School, especially the on site team.  From the very beginning of the job, everyone knew the undertaking this project was with a very limited time schedule for the massive scope and the constant collaborative nature of the team at every phase led to a very positive experience for all parties.
“The tornado that damaged the cafeteria during construction, the rising river level that caused a “No Dig” order and the constant weather of South Louisiana were all handled with ease, and the job continued progress with minimum setbacks. With all of this, the quality of the work achieved has still been exceptional.  The building, one of two of the first Public buildings in Louisiana to be built from the ground up since Katrina, is a quality product and more importantly opened on schedule allowing students from one of the most affected areas to begin this school year in a brand new facility.”
John C. Williams
John C. Williams Architects, LLC

“The N.P. Trist School was the second miracle performed, Andrew Jackson immediately preceding, for the St. Bernard Parish School Board in the renovation and rehabilitation of Hurricane Katrina ravaged school buildings at the hands of the design team of Lachin Oubre & Associates, in partnership with the General Contractor, Gibbs Construction Company.”
Lachin Oubre & Associates

“Your team gave back to them Andrew Jackson, Gauthier, Rowley, and Trist schools – and now you have given them the beautiful Davies and Smith Elementary Schools.  Please know that you are, indeed, a driving force in the redevelopment of St. Bernard Parish.
“Again, thank you for your hard work, your Herculean efforts at meeting short time-lines, and your enthusiasm in giving children their schools back.  These two schools, in particular, are 21st Century, state-of-the-art, technology-rich institutions of learning, and you should take great pride in Gibbs Construction’s efforts in helping our visions for our children become realities.”
Doris Voitier
Superintendent
St. Bernard Parish School Board

“As Project Manager for the Owner, I have had the opportunity to work, literally, side-by-side with Gibbs’ team in the construction of the Louisiana ArtWorks Building.
“They have consistently approached the complexities of this multi-use, multi-structure facility with dedication, determination and pride.
“It is not sufficient to say that Gibbs was the General Contractor on this project.  They have been a team player, a supporter and a sincere friend to the Owner and the realization of ArtWorks.”
Karen MH Kersting
Project Manager, Louisiana ArtWorks
Arts Council of New Orleans

“Your company achieved an amazing feat through your meticulous and expeditious reconstruction of Eight Air Force’ Headquarters building. 
“Thanks to your efforts, we now have first class facilities from which to execute these new missions and enable strike forces to combatant commanders around the globe.
“I know it’s a long trip – Thanks for coming up and thanks for putting together the team that gave us back our Home – its first class!”
