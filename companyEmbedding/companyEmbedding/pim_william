Product information management

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Product information management (PIM) means managing the information required to market and sell products through distribution channels. A central set of product data can be used to feed information to media such as web sites, print catalogs, ERP systems, and electronic data feeds to trading partners.
PIM systems generally need to support multiple geographic locations, multi-lingual data, and maintenance and modification of product information within a centralized catalog. Information kept by a business can be scattered throughout departments and held by employees or systems, instead of being available centrally; data may be saved in various formats, or only be available in hard copy form. Information may be needed for detailed product descriptions with prices, or calculating freight costs. PIM represents a solution for centralized, media-independent data maintenance, as well as efficient data collection, management, refinement and output.

Synonyms and related terms[edit]
One finds a number of other terms that are similar or synonymous in meaning, usually deriving from other fields. These include:

PDM – Product data management derives from the concept of engineering data management (EDM), denoting systems for the effective management of product development data and the coordination of manufacturing-related processes. The term is used primarily in the field of computer-aided design (CAD).
PRM – Product resource management is used by some software providers as a synonym for PIM (Product Information Management), as well as Product Content Management (PCM), mainly popular as a term in England and France.
Product life-cycle management (PLM) refers more to a management strategy than to a specific IT technology, the goal of which is to optimize product life cycles through the gathering and analysis of product data generated over time.
Media asset management (MAM) refers to the management of unstructured multimedia objects such as images, graphics and presentations as well as ‘meta-information’ (data about data). The term is used primarily in the media business.
Cross media publishing (CMP) comes from the print and advertising industries, referring to the coordinated use of multiple media in complementary fashion. It also denotes the repeat usage of individual structural elements such as text, images or graphics within different media.

Link with enterprise content management[edit]
Enterprise content management is a term encompassing technologies, methods and tools used for gathering, imaging, storing, archiving and providing electronic content. Distinction can be made between four separate sub-areas. Document management systems (DMS) are deployed for archiving, and PDM involves the management of structured, technical data for such applications as parts diagrams and lists. Content management systems (CMS) are more commercially oriented and provide a framework for knowledge management or informational service offerings through the management of unstructured, document-type content. PIM systems are used to manage structured data in a business context for feeding into any kind of distribution channel, from electronic catalogs to online shops to print catalogs.
Technological basis of product information management (PIM)[edit]
PIM systems consolidate all product information onto a single platform. In terms of company IT infrastructure, this means having a PIM platform running over alongside a database with an application server, and/or xml based exchange of product information. This forms a foundation upon which to build sales and procurement business processes. With PIM solutions, access[1] and user authorizations for all database information, ordering processes linked with inventory management systems and the mechanisms for modular expansions are managed via a web-based administration interface.
Electronic catalogs[edit]
Procurement systems and platforms such as online marketplaces are based upon electronic catalogs. PIM systems can load descriptive product information as content into a catalog management solution, where products are grouped and managed for specific target markets. Data exchange interface standards such as Open ICEcat and CADA BAZAAR allow seamless interchange of electronic catalogs between vendors on the one hand and purchasing firms and marketplace operators on the other. Procurement solutions are closely related, which automate the procurement process for purchasing goods and services. These create transparency for the product data of multiple vendors to support the centralized management of multi-supplier catalogs and facilitate price and quality research.
The market for PIM solutions[edit]
PIM solutions are most relevant to firms in retailing, consumer goods and manufacturing. Considerations in opting for a PIM solution include:

wide array of products
frequently changing product characteristics
non-uniform IT infrastructure (perhaps resulting from a merger)
online business
electronic ordering.

Leading PIM vendors[edit]
According to the latest report published by independent technology research company Gartner, the Magic Quadrant for Master Data Management Solutions (a merger of MDM Customer and PIM solutions covering now Multidomain MDM) published 19 January 2017, contains two companies in the visionaries leader quadrant, Informatica and Orchestra Networks. Both provide a solid Multidomain MDM solution, where Product is one of the domains. Compared to the Magic Quadrant report for Master Data Management of Product Data Solutions in 2016 [2] we see the, then leading vendors in the market Oracle, IBM, Stibo Systems, Riversand and Tibco Software are reshuffled due to the fact other criteria are used to make up the qualification. Informatica was already present with both their MDM solutions for products in the 2016 report and the combination made them leader in 2017.
Forrester Research, another independent technology research company, identified in their 2016 Forrester Wave [3] the leading Product Information Management vendors as Informatica, Stibo Systems, Riversand and EnterWorks.
Ventana Research, another independent technology research company, identified and ranked leading Product Information Management vendors Stibo Systems, Informatica, Agility Multichannel, Riversand, Enterworks, SAP, no:WebOn, Oracle, ADAM software and IBM in their 2015 Value Index.[4] The evaluation was based on usability, capability, validation, and ROI.
RnR Market, another independent technology research company, identified in their 2016 "Product Information Management Market" report[5] the key vendors being Adam Systems, Agility Multichannel, IBM, Informatica, inRiver, Oracle, Pimcore, Riversand, SAP AG, Stibo Systems.

Three Game Changers within Product Information Management

11th May 2017Henrik Liliendahl 


Product Information Management (PIM) is a fast-growing discipline enabled by PIM platforms. While the current market for PIM platforms is much about supporting a consistent in-house management of the information related to product models we make, buy and sell, there are new opportunities arising. Three of them on my radar are:
Internet of Things (IoT)
With the rise of IoT and the related theme Industry 4.0 we will in the future not just have to deal with the product model but also each physical instance of that product. As an example of how many product groups that might embrace, read about that IKEA is thinking about embedding its furniture with artificial intelligence.
Value webs
The recent buzzword in the chain starting with “supply chain” and going over “value chain” is “value web”. Learn about the arrival of continuously evolving business ecosystems and value webs in this article from Deloitte University Press. Product information management encompassing business ecosystems will be imperative in value webs.
Product Data Lake
This is in all humbleness my venture by having launched a PIM-2-PIM platform that deals with the current main pain in product information management, being exchanging product information between trading partners. We do that in an agile and automated way by supporting partnerships in value webs and are soon adding things to Product Data Lake.

Product information management

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Product information management (PIM) means managing the information required to market and sell products through distribution channels. A central set of product data can be used to feed information to media such as web sites, print catalogs, ERP systems, and electronic data feeds to trading partners.
PIM systems generally need to support multiple geographic locations, multi-lingual data, and maintenance and modification of product information within a centralized catalog. Information kept by a business can be scattered throughout departments and held by employees or systems, instead of being available centrally; data may be saved in various formats, or only be available in hard copy form. Information may be needed for detailed product descriptions with prices, or calculating freight costs. PIM represents a solution for centralized, media-independent data maintenance, as well as efficient data collection, management, refinement and output.

Synonyms and related terms[edit]
One finds a number of other terms that are similar or synonymous in meaning, usually deriving from other fields. These include:

PDM – Product data management derives from the concept of engineering data management (EDM), denoting systems for the effective management of product development data and the coordination of manufacturing-related processes. The term is used primarily in the field of computer-aided design (CAD).
PRM – Product resource management is used by some software providers as a synonym for PIM (Product Information Management), as well as Product Content Management (PCM), mainly popular as a term in England and France.
Product life-cycle management (PLM) refers more to a management strategy than to a specific IT technology, the goal of which is to optimize product life cycles through the gathering and analysis of product data generated over time.
Media asset management (MAM) refers to the management of unstructured multimedia objects such as images, graphics and presentations as well as ‘meta-information’ (data about data). The term is used primarily in the media business.
Cross media publishing (CMP) comes from the print and advertising industries, referring to the coordinated use of multiple media in complementary fashion. It also denotes the repeat usage of individual structural elements such as text, images or graphics within different media.

Link with enterprise content management[edit]
Enterprise content management is a term encompassing technologies, methods and tools used for gathering, imaging, storing, archiving and providing electronic content. Distinction can be made between four separate sub-areas. Document management systems (DMS) are deployed for archiving, and PDM involves the management of structured, technical data for such applications as parts diagrams and lists. Content management systems (CMS) are more commercially oriented and provide a framework for knowledge management or informational service offerings through the management of unstructured, document-type content. PIM systems are used to manage structured data in a business context for feeding into any kind of distribution channel, from electronic catalogs to online shops to print catalogs.
Technological basis of product information management (PIM)[edit]
PIM systems consolidate all product information onto a single platform. In terms of company IT infrastructure, this means having a PIM platform running over alongside a database with an application server, and/or xml based exchange of product information. This forms a foundation upon which to build sales and procurement business processes. With PIM solutions, access[1] and user authorizations for all database information, ordering processes linked with inventory management systems and the mechanisms for modular expansions are managed via a web-based administration interface.
Electronic catalogs[edit]
Procurement systems and platforms such as online marketplaces are based upon electronic catalogs. PIM systems can load descriptive product information as content into a catalog management solution, where products are grouped and managed for specific target markets. Data exchange interface standards such as Open ICEcat and CADA BAZAAR allow seamless interchange of electronic catalogs between vendors on the one hand and purchasing firms and marketplace operators on the other. Procurement solutions are closely related, which automate the procurement process for purchasing goods and services. These create transparency for the product data of multiple vendors to support the centralized management of multi-supplier catalogs and facilitate price and quality research.
The market for PIM solutions[edit]
PIM solutions are most relevant to firms in retailing, consumer goods and manufacturing. Considerations in opting for a PIM solution include:

wide array of products
frequently changing product characteristics
non-uniform IT infrastructure (perhaps resulting from a merger)
online business
electronic ordering.

Leading PIM vendors[edit]
According to the latest report published by independent technology research company Gartner, the Magic Quadrant for Master Data Management Solutions (a merger of MDM Customer and PIM solutions covering now Multidomain MDM) published 19 January 2017, contains two companies in the visionaries leader quadrant, Informatica and Orchestra Networks. Both provide a solid Multidomain MDM solution, where Product is one of the domains. Compared to the Magic Quadrant report for Master Data Management of Product Data Solutions in 2016 [2] we see the, then leading vendors in the market Oracle, IBM, Stibo Systems, Riversand and Tibco Software are reshuffled due to the fact other criteria are used to make up the qualification. Informatica was already present with both their MDM solutions for products in the 2016 report and the combination made them leader in 2017.
Forrester Research, another independent technology research company, identified in their 2016 Forrester Wave [3] the leading Product Information Management vendors as Informatica, Stibo Systems, Riversand and EnterWorks.
Ventana Research, another independent technology research company, identified and ranked leading Product Information Management vendors Stibo Systems, Informatica, Agility Multichannel, Riversand, Enterworks, SAP, no:WebOn, Oracle, ADAM software and IBM in their 2015 Value Index.[4] The evaluation was based on usability, capability, validation, and ROI.
RnR Market, another independent technology research company, identified in their 2016 "Product Information Management Market" report[5] the key vendors being Adam Systems, Agility Multichannel, IBM, Informatica, inRiver, Oracle, Pimcore, Riversand, SAP AG, Stibo Systems.

The surname Pim originally derived from the Old English word Pymma which came from Euphemia. The surname Pim referred to the son of Euphemia which belongs to the category of  patronymic surnames.Pim Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Pim was first found in  Somerset where the family can be "traced to Philip Pym, of Brymmore, 12 Edward IV." [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Lowe, Mark Anthony, Patronymica Britannica, A Dictionary of Family Names of the United Kingdom. London: John Russel Smith, 1860. Print. Indeed, there is much debate about the origin of this name. Another reference claims "considering that Eufemia is fairly common in the   Hundred Rolls, that Pimme is feminine, and Phemie is still the  nickname, it all but certain that we have here the solution of the name in question. Personally I have no doubt that this derivation is correct. " [2]CITATION[CLOSE]Reaney, P.H and R.M. Wilson, A Dictionary of English Surnames. London: Routledge, 1991. Print. (ISBN 0-415-05737-X) The   Hundred Rolls of 1273 lists the following: Eufemmia de Neville in Lincolnshire; Katerina Eufemme in Norfolk; Pimme, widow of Peter Seman in Cumberland; Bartholomew  filius Pimme in Hunts; Chun Pimme in Cambridge and finally Henry Pimme in Cambridge. Later the  Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379, list Agnes Pyme and Johannes Pymson. [2]CITATION[CLOSE]Reaney, P.H and R.M. Wilson, A Dictionary of English Surnames. London: Routledge, 1991. Print. (ISBN 0-415-05737-X)Pim Spelling VariationsPim Spelling VariationsThe English language only became standardized in the last few centuries; therefore, spelling variations are common among early  Anglo-Saxon names. As the form of the English language changed, even the spelling of literate people's names evolved. Pim has been recorded under many different variations, including Pym, Pymm, Pyme, Pymme, Pim, Pimm, Pimme and others.Pim Early HistoryPim Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Pim research.

Another 39 words (3 lines of text) about their life in  Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.The Great MigrationThe Great MigrationFor many English families, the political and religious disarray that shrouded  England made the far away New World an attractive prospect. On cramped disease-ridden ships, thousands migrated to those British colonies that would eventually become Canada and the United States. Those hardy settlers that survived the journey often went on to make important contributions to the emerging nations in which they landed. Analysis of immigration records indicates that some of the first North American immigrants bore the name Pim or a variant listed above: Pim Settlers in United States in the 17th CenturyDorothy Pim, who arrived in Virginia in 1637 [3]CITATION[CLOSE]Filby, P.

A Product Information Management (PIM) Solar System

4th May 20179th June 2017Henrik Liliendahl 


Hundreds of years ago the geocentric model was replaced by heliocentrism, meaning that we recognize that the earth travels around the sun and not the other way around.
When it comes to Product Information Management (PIM), we also need a Copernican Revolution, meaning that it is good to manage product information consistently inside a given company, but it is better to manage product information in the light of the business ecosystem where we participate.
Exchanging product information in the business ecosystems of manufacturers, distributors and retailers cannot work properly by asking all your trading partners to use your version of a spreadsheet – if they don’t get to you first with their version. Nor will self-centered supplier / customer product data portals work as examined in the post PIM Supplier Portals: Are They Good or Bad?
Your company is not a lonely planet. You are part of a business ecosystem, where you may be:

Upstream as the maker of goods and services. For that you need to buy raw materials and indirect goods from the parties being your vendors. In a data driven world you also to need to receive product information for these items. You need to sell your finished products to the midstream and downstream parties being your B2B customers. For that you need to provide product information to those parties.
Midstream as a distributor (wholesaler) of products. You need to receive product information from upstream parties being your vendors, perhaps enrich and adapt the product information and provide this information to the parties being your downstream B2B customers.
Downstream as a retailer or large end user of product information. You need to receive product information from upstream parties being your vendors and enrich and adapt the product information so you will be the preferred seller to the parties being your B2B customers and/or B2C customers.

At Product Data Lake we support business ecosystems in Product Information Management (PIM). And this is not just a nice model. There are concrete business benefits too. 5 for you and 5 for your trading partner:  Check our 10 business benefits.

The surname Pim originally derived from the Old English word Pymma which came from Euphemia. The surname Pim referred to the son of Euphemia which belongs to the category of  patronymic surnames.Pim Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Pim was first found in  Somerset where the family can be "traced to Philip Pym, of Brymmore, 12 Edward IV." [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Lowe, Mark Anthony, Patronymica Britannica, A Dictionary of Family Names of the United Kingdom. London: John Russel Smith, 1860. Print. Indeed, there is much debate about the origin of this name. Another reference claims "considering that Eufemia is fairly common in the   Hundred Rolls, that Pimme is feminine, and Phemie is still the  nickname, it all but certain that we have here the solution of the name in question. Personally I have no doubt that this derivation is correct. " [2]CITATION[CLOSE]Reaney, P.H and R.M. Wilson, A Dictionary of English Surnames. London: Routledge, 1991. Print. (ISBN 0-415-05737-X) The   Hundred Rolls of 1273 lists the following: Eufemmia de Neville in Lincolnshire; Katerina Eufemme in Norfolk; Pimme, widow of Peter Seman in Cumberland; Bartholomew  filius Pimme in Hunts; Chun Pimme in Cambridge and finally Henry Pimme in Cambridge. Later the  Yorkshire Poll Tax Rolls of 1379, list Agnes Pyme and Johannes Pymson. [2]CITATION[CLOSE]Reaney, P.H and R.M. Wilson, A Dictionary of English Surnames. London: Routledge, 1991. Print. (ISBN 0-415-05737-X)Pim Spelling VariationsPim Spelling VariationsThe English language only became standardized in the last few centuries; therefore, spelling variations are common among early  Anglo-Saxon names. As the form of the English language changed, even the spelling of literate people's names evolved. Pim has been recorded under many different variations, including Pym, Pymm, Pyme, Pymme, Pim, Pimm, Pimme and others.Pim Early HistoryPim Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Pim research. Another 259 words (18 lines of text) covering the years 1400, 1440, 1663, 1584, 1643, 1615, 1671, 1641, 1648 and 1660 are included under the topic Early Pim History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.Pim Early Notables (pre 1700)Pim Early Notables (pre 1700)Distinguished members of the family include John Pym (1584-1643), English statesman, who moved for the impeachment of advisers to Charles I, actions which led to the English Civil War; and Sir Charles... Another 32 words (2 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Pim Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.Pim In IrelandPim In IrelandSome of the Pim family moved to  Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt. Another 39 words (3 lines of text) about their life in  Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.The Great MigrationThe Great MigrationFor many English families, the political and religious disarray that shrouded  England made the far away New World an attractive prospect. On cramped disease-ridden ships, thousands migrated to those British colonies that would eventually become Canada and the United States. Those hardy settlers that survived the journey often went on to make important contributions to the emerging nations in which they landed. Analysis of immigration records indicates that some of the first North American immigrants bore the name Pim or a variant listed above: Pim Settlers in United States in the 17th CenturyDorothy Pim, who arrived in Virginia in 1637 [3]CITATION[CLOSE]Filby, P.
