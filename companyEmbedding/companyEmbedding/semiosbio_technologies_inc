Semios’ system allows you to set pest pressure alerts and thresholds for any block or trap.


Remote Scheduling
Dispense pheromones at user-defined rates based on topography, wind direction or pests.


Pest Degree-Days

Automated Pest Counts & Pest Pressure Notifications

Semios’ camera-traps allow visual inspection of each field trap from Semios’ interface. Each image is associated with an automated catch-value to ensure each trap is giving the most accurate and up-to-date pest pressure information.

Automated daily trap counts

Trend analysis and alerts



Pest Degree-Day Models & Forecasting

No longer rely on third-party weather stations in the next city – Semios gives site-specific degree-day values including percent egg and hatch driven directly off installed weather stations.

VINELAND STATION, Ont.—A British Columbia biotech firm is receiving as much as $474,000 from the federal government as it continues to develop a pest control product to help battle bed bugs.
Announced at its Vineland Station, Ont., location in the province’s Niagara Region, B.C.-based semiosBIO Technologies Inc. is getting the cash injection to complete product development and pre-commercialization of its SemiosGUARD pest control management system.
The world’s first pheromone-based bedbug management product, SemiosGUARD uses natural semio-chemicals to help control bedbugs.
The company is receiving the money in the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario) and its Investing in Business Innovation initiative.
“Our government is investing in the ideas and the people of southern Ontario to create jobs, growth and long-term prosperity,”  Niagara West-Glanbrook MP Dean Allison said in a statement.
“By supporting the innovative ideas here in southern Ontario, we are helping start-up companies and investors work together, and equipping businesses with the tools they need to succeed.”
According to FedDev Ontario, the company was also able to attract as much as $948,000 from a group of an angel investors from the Niagara Angel Network, registered with the Network of Angel Organizations—Ontario.
SemiosGUARD is expected to have a significant impact on the hospitality sector and for emergency responders, including fire fighters and paramedics.
The company anticipates creating 21 positions during the implementation of the project activities, and an additional 35 jobs in southern Ontario by 2017 as a result of the project.
“FedDev Ontario’s contribution to our project is essential to our goal of further developing and commercializing the world’s first pheromone-based bedbug management product,” semiosBIO founder and president Dr. Michael Gilbert said.
“We have the right innovative biotech expertise to take advantage of this market opportunity. This investment, and our own commitment along with the angel investment it has helped us to obtain, will position semiosBIO to bring a great new product to the world and to create local jobs in the process.”

Michael Gilbert, SemiosBIO Technologies | BCBusinessSemiosBIO scientist Michael Gilbert tests his company's electronic insect deterrence.


	Congratulations to SemiosBIO, #3 in 2013's Most Innovative Companies in B.C.
Even with increased regulation on pesticides in North America, Canada still tolerates significantly more toxins on our crops than Europe, which means we miss out on business when exporting our harvests. Add to that the need for more effective, economical and sustainable pest management and the agricultural sector is facing a sea change.


Enter Vancouver-based SemiosBIO Technologies Inc., which since 2009 has offered SemiosNET, a pest management system for farming that is devoid of neurotoxins. Camera-equipped traps that monitor pest activity are placed throughout a field or orchard, approximately one for every hectare. A central hub then delivers this information, as well as weather data, to SemiosNET software that both records the data and manages the devices. Growers and their consultants then monitor their crops in real time and isolate insect pressure on a precise area, then use remotely controlled dispensers (approximately two per hectare) to spray pheromones; these manipulate the insects’ communication pathways, confusing them so that males can’t find females and the bugs can’t reproduce. In addition to being non-toxic, the pheromone treatments actually cost less than traditional pesticides.


Michael Gilbert, a chemist and chief scientific officer at SemiosBIO, credits the company’s coup in bringing this product to market to good timing: it perfected its alternative to toxic pesticides just as the machine-to-machine technology at the heart of the SemiosNET system became available.


SemiosBIO now has 22 employees, $6 million in capital investment behind it—plus a recent $2.8-million injection from the federal government—and 25 systems in the field in Canada, covering about 1,000 hectares of crops. This year it projects more than 40 systems in Canada, five in the U.S., five in Europe and up to 10 in Latin America. “The company is in a land grab,” says Gilbert. “We want acres.”
