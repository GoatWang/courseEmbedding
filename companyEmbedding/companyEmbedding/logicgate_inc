Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance, or GRC, is a blanket term that refers to a company's integrated strategy for tackling the broad issues of corporate governance, enterprise risk management (ERM) and corporate compliance. The components of GRC are:Governance— The management processes that enable effective decision making to ensure an organization achieves its goals.Risk Management— The process of setting acceptable enterprise risk thresholds and then analyzing, tracking, and mitigating potential issues to ensure the appropriate risk level is met.Compliance— The process of conforming with external rules and regulations and internally defined directives and standards.Agile GRC Solutions —Adapt to Changing EnvironmentsWhat is Agile GRC?           LogicGate believes that technology should be the link between the Governance, Risk, and Compliance pillars in GRC. Traditional GRC software is complicated, inflexible, and time consuming. Agile GRC enables organizations to quickly implement robust GRC solutions that can change and grow with the rapidly changing business landscape. The benefits of Agile GRC:Rapidly roll out compliance solutions as new issues arise.Allow compliance managers to change business logic that drives work through your compliance regime.Automate workflow, delegate tasks, and facilitate communication between compliance, legal, and risk departments and decision makers.Can be customized as your business grows, as you encounter new risks, and as rules and regulations change.Provide a digital “paper trail” that can be accessed from anywhere Intuitive Technology       Our mission is to design GRC software that does not require months of professional training for organizations to start seeing ROI. Our LogicGate platform engages users from their first interactions to more advanced administrator functions.Organizations can focus on what matters — running their business and building a top-class GRC program rather than learning new software. We build our solutions with a user-first mentality.          Companies can achieve results in GRC much faster. About LogicGateThe LogicGate platform enables organizations to easily create solutions to solve the challenge of Governance, Risk, and Compliance head-on. No two businesses face the same risks or compliance challenges, and that’s why LogicGate flexible workflow model has been effective at helping companies implement GRC solutions. LogicGate's pre-configured solutions can be easily deployed to solve the most critical GRC issues, such as Enterprise Risk Mangement , Policy Management , and Regulatory Compliance GRC In Depth — Empowering Decision MakersGovernance: Making the Right DecisionsMaking the right decisions is what drives progress for organizations. The decisions that drive a business forward are made by many employees through the organization, in line with their expertise (Product Development, Manufacturing, Marketing, etc.). Governance processes and activities ensure that the key information the managers use for decision making is accurate, complete, and relevant. Governance processes also ensure that the decisions made by management (the strategies, directions, and instructions) are communicated and executed effectively. The goal of any great GRC software is to provide decision makers the upfront information about potential risks and provide the ability to execute on decisions through effective compliance controls and communication. Risk Management: Identifying, Analyzing, & AssessingRisks are an inherent part of any business. As an organization grows, newfound risks can emerge that did not exist before that must be incorporated into its risk assessments.  To successfully manage risk, an organization must be able to identify, analyze, and, if necessary, respond to risks that might negatively impact their business decisions, goals, and objectives. Organizations must be capable enough to manage risks from a wide variety of sources, such as commercial/financial risks, information security risks, technological risks, to name a few. External legal and regulatory risks are perhaps the key issue in GRC today. Compliance: Following the RulesThe starting point for any strong compliance program is to effectively identify all of the rules, regulations, laws, and internally defined directives that the organization must follow. An organization’s compliance to this corpus of applicable rules and regulations must be continually monitored and assessed as their business and laws change.  As gaps in organizational compliance are discovered, decisions must be made to prioritize, fund, and initiate corrective actions deemed necessary.

Comments:  We had several outdated and manual compliance processes that were taking up a majority of our employees work day and issues were slipping through the cracks. We also weren¿t able to effectively report on the health of our compliance department or how we were complying with regulatory requirements to leadership and government agencies. LogicGate helped us turn our compliance program around and we now have the visibility needed to quickly answer government inquiries and provide the leadership team with the transparency they were requesting. Lastly, their team couldn¿t have been more responsive, anytime I needed to get ahold of them I could. It was a great all around experience and I very much enjoyed working with the professionals at Capria.

LogicGate offers the ability to provide custom workflows on the fly to those who truly understand the needs of the project and adequately provide metrics for performance throughout the life-cycle of the workflow.What do you dislike?At times, it can be difficult to remember all of the steps involved or needed for in the initial development of the workflow.

The other big advantage of LogicGate is that it was very easy to customize the platform to fit our risk framework and scoring methodology, rather than having to adjust our framework to fit the tool, which would have been the case with several GRC platforms on the market today.What do you dislike?No complaints so far.  There are a few features we'd like to see in order to broaden the use of the platform, but the team at LogicGate has been really receptive to those and has plans in place to implement these in the near future.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?With LogicGate, we have been able to streamline our risk assessment process and equip business owners with the information they need to assess and mitigate risks on their own, with only consulting support from the risk and compliance function.

Integrated Room Control
Productivity for important rooms in your business such as a conference room, boardroom, or executive office is increased when all the smart technology and subsystems work together with simple control. When presenting to clients from a laptop, pressing a single “Presentation” button dims lights, lowers blackout shades, turns on video display, and audio. By integrating everything in a room from audio, video, lights, window treatments, networking, and communications you have complete and easy control from a single touch screen, keypad, remote or mobile device. No more walking over to turn off lights and lower shades or wasting time and getting frustrated during in-person or video conference meetings.


Centralized Distribution
Centralized Distribution allows for complete control and connectivity throughout your facility, every application and every budget.  The power of total integrated control and seamless connectivity all manifest from one centralized hub or control room. Less wall clutter and equipment is spread throughout and staff gets easier access and control. System expansion is easy; every room and each device is simply another node on the network.


Lighting Control
Maybe you'd like to make the perfect ambiance possible and increase comfort in every part of the office. Or perhaps you're just looking for a few easy ways to save energy through the smart balancing of both electric light and daylight. Have lights turn off automatically when employees or guests leave rooms to save on energy bills. Set lights in the waiting room to a warm, welcoming glow while lights in the surgical room are bright enough for procedures. Program lights to dim automatically as the sun sets so your guests hardly notice a change and your staff isn’t running around turning lights off manually. No matter what your intention, intelligent lighting with is always a bright idea.



 
 



Motorized Window Treatments
With motorized window treatments you can easily adjust the amount of daylight in your space to increase comfort, save energy, and protect interiors. Automated shading and drapery transforms harsh glare into soft pleasing light, enhances privacy while preserving exterior views, reduces solar heat gain, and provides UV protection of expensive furnishings and artwork. Have a game changing presentation? The ability to transform daytime into nighttime for theatric presentations worthy of cinematic ambiance can make all the difference in communicating your message to an enthusiastic audience with the simple press of a button. Owners and members of the design team have hundreds of window treatment fabric and color options available to compliment any décor.


HVAC Control
Smart control of heating, ventilation and cooling makes it easy for you to set the perfect temperature of your business regardless of the season or other environmental conditions. Create a comfortable environment by making adjustments from the same touch screen you use to control lights, shades, and the AV system. Monitor and control your thermostats from a mobile device if AC is blasting in an unoccupied area or turn up the heat to increase comfort for guests and employees. Save energy with programmed settings and integration to a building automation system.


Occupancy Monitoring
Integrating non-intrusive occupancy monitoring with a smart technology system enables advanced energy-efficiency optimization to be realized. A variety of environmental sensors for motion, acoustic, and heat are positioned within the space to effectively determine if anyone is in the room and trigger automatic adjustments to subsystems such as electric lighting and window treatments, HVAC, audio and video. You no longer need to worry that the AC is blasting or lights are on when nobody is in the room. Additionally, usage patterns over time are analyzed and sensitivity levels of the sensors are adapted accordingly.

Design-Build Process
As a Design-Build technology integrator we implement 5 Phases through the course of a project from concept to completion. Careful thought and attention is given during each step to ensure you receive a solution tailored to your needs and delivers the benefits you desire. We are committed to making the entire experience from start to finish as effective and efficient as possible.
We are responsible for all phases of the AV and integrated technology work including the needs assessment, system design, engineering, installation, commissioning, training and service. During the design-build process it is very important to ensure the needs analysis (also called the Discovery) has been performed otherwise the system design and project contract will be too vague.














 





.1 Discovery Process:
The project always begins with a discovery process, where we listen to our client's needs and desires. Our preliminary interviews are relaxed yet specific, as we endeavor to balance the desires of the client with the realities of technological trends, budget constraints and built-in obsolescence.







.2 System Design:
Now that pertinent information has been gathered, a detailed report can be developed in accordance to these plans. We put our system design team to work to define all aspects of the project functionality for each room or area. An extensive set of project drawings are created that show graphically where all hardware and pre-wire drops will be located. In addition all hardware and labor is defined with exacting detail. We meet with the client to deliver this information for review, feedback and ultimate approval.







.3 Engineering:
After client has signed off on the system design and project price, our engineering team will plan and produce documents and drawings for the installation of the technical solutions to not only meet client needs, but ensure reliability and ease of use. A complete engineering documentation package will be presented to the client at the completion of the project.







.4 Implementation Process:
Once rough and trim phase engineering documentation is complete, we are ready to install the infrastructure such as conduit, low voltage wiring and enclosure. We purchase all AV equipment and assemble as appropriate in our office or at the job site. Our job is only complete when the client is 100% satisfied with the finished product. The length of time for this phase is dependent upon the time frame of construction. Once system installation is complete, all engineering documentation is updated to an as-built state.







.5 Service & Support:
A complete set of as-built documentation is delivered to every client at the final project sign-off. We strive to make every client, a client for life. By delivering as-built documentation and programming source code to our clients, we ensure that the investment they have made into their home is well protected and may be serviced for life with accuracy and diligence. We honor all manufacturer warranties plus a 12 month workmanship warranty.
