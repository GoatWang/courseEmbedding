(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and those in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission December 15, 2015 and all subsequent filings.  Overview  StreamTrack, Inc. ("StreamTrack," or the "Company") is a digital media and technology services company. The Company provides audio and video streaming and advertising services through the RadioLoyaltyTM Platform (the "Platform") to a global group of over 5,000 internet and terrestrial radio stations and other broadcast content providers. We also developing Robot Fruit, which is intended to be a powerful marketing tool that combines a mobile app creation platform, customer loyalty program, and content management system into an instant and measurable marketing engine for businesses. The Company is also continuing development of StreamTrak, designed to enable fans, artists, bands, music publishers and record labels to distribute, discover, create and share content.In addition, the Company through ampedfantasy.com has entered the rapidly growing daily fantasy sports industry. The Amped Fantasy brand will offer diverse contests to attract fans of all kinds. The mobile and web offering which is under development will include, but not be limited to free and paid daily, weekly, pick'em, salary cap, flex or customized roster and guaranteed prize or payout contests. Fantify which is under development, is a fully customizable daily fantasy sports and private label fantasy sports technology platform. Once venues signup for Fantify and setup a contest, they invite new or existing customers, and award prizes. It will be free to play for customers to win prizes, compete against friends and others, feel closer to the real life game, and all with no season-long commitment. Through sportsalert.com the Company owns a subscriber based alert system for various sports with over 100,000 registered users. Users can choose whether they want score updates sent to their mobile phone or email, customizable by sport and events.  Our streaming business model is focused on the following core principles:  1. We barter with audio content providers, namely internet and terrestrial radio stations, to obtain control and management of their desktop advertising opportunity ("Ad Inventory"). We also routinely purchase any Ad Inventory the content providers have not previously transferred to us by barter.  2. In exchange for the Ad Inventory, we pay for all internet and mobile streaming costs associated with the broadcaster's content that is streamed through our platform. We barter in order to scale our business. The end result of the barter is that we aggregate Ad Inventory from broadcasters that management believes can reach substantial size while maintaining a primarily fixed cost structure for our hardware, content delivery, labor and other costs, respectively.  3. We re-broadcast original audio broadcast content through the Platform in a streaming media format in desktop and mobile environments. By re-broadcasting we ensure that we do not pay any royalties. Royalties are the responsibility of our broadcasters. This is a substantial advantage for us as many of our competitors pay royalties of up to 70% of revenues generated from licensed broadcast content.  4. We serve advertisements ("Ads") within the Platform in audio, display and video formats in a desktop environment and display ads in a mobile environment using our RadioLoyaltyTM Apps.  5. Ads are served by our automated systems based on geography and demographics data, among others.  6. The primary technology that makes our Platform unique in the industry is that we are able to re-broadcast audio content with geographically targeted Ads that replace Ads served within an original broadcast targeting a listener in a certain geography. By having this capability we can also choose to replace audio Ads that do not generate as high of Ad revenues with video-based Ads that generate much higher Ad revenues. In effect, we make the broadcaster's original broadcast capable of delivering Ads that are geographically targeted throughout a global broadcast marketplace while also utilizing video Ads and our proprietary video in-stream technology to increase advertising rates.  7. All of our primary technology that supports the Platform is automated and capable of operating in a live environment. Audio content is streamed, Ads are targeted and served, audio Ads are replaced as needed and video Ads replace audio Ads, as desired and when possible.  Advertising revenue constitutes the majority of our total revenue, representing 96.4% of total revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2016. We anticipate this trend will continue and our revenues will be generated primarily from advertising. Our advertising revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 was almost entirely derived from advertising delivered on desktop devices.  We deliver content on mobile devices through our RadioLoyaltyTM app but we do not currently generate significant mobile advertising revenues. Management believes that mobile advertising represents an opportunity for the Company in the coming years and on an ongoing basis. Management expects the mobile advertising market will grow at substantial rates in the coming years. However, many challenges exist in this market. We believe these challenges will be solved primarily with new technologies. We believe our current technologies and other technology under development will solve some of these challenges. By solving these challenges, we will be able to monetize the mobile listenership we are growing today.  Table of Contents  In June 2015, the Company received an Office Action where the examiner laid out new grounds of rejection addressed to the new claim language from our previous amendment to U.S. App No.: 12/146,922 - WATCH THIS - RAD-00330. Claims 20, 22-27, 36, and 38-43 were rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2006/0089843 filed 10/26/2004 by Flather in view of US 2008/0307454 filed 6/6/08 by Ahanger et al in view of US 2008/0109844 filed 11 /2/06 by Baldeschwieler et al. in view of US 2013/0061262 with priority to 1 /30/0S, filed by Briggs et al. The Company had until June 19, 2015 to respond to this decision, and while the Company believes that its claims are patentable, it choose not to pursue the claims further because it would have been cost prohibitive.  The Company is exploring alternative options as it relates to the WatchThis technology. On February 2, 2016 the Company sold the domain name www.watchthis.com for $30,000. While the USPTO has rejected our claims put forth, management believes that the viability of the technology is still feasible. Currently we have stopped development of this product until management identifies all of the options that are available for the business to potentially pursue.  In November 2013, we completed an asset purchase of RobotFruit, a mobile loyalty and application platform. Robot Fruit provides a complete SAAS based mobile platform for publishers and content owners to directly sell their mobile web and in-app ad inventory on leading mobile devices. The platform is a self-service mobile loyalty and development platform that has an easy to use interface which enables station owners, content owners, business owners, artists and bands to quickly deploy in HTML5, native iOS and Android based application environments. We anticipate making the technology available to broadcasters, content owners and artists in the coming months.  In April 2015, we completed an asset purchase of Amped Fantasy and SportsAlert(TM), a daily fantasy sports and alert platform. Amped Fantasy provides a complete daily fantasy sports web based platform where players compete to win cash and prizes. The platform is designed with an easy to use interface which enables players to compete across all major professional sports events. SportsAlert is an alert messaging platform that allows subscribers to obtain current stats and scores relating to teams or individual players performances. The daily fantasy sports industry is experiencing rapid growth. Traditional fantasy sports games have been an integral part of the sports industry for decades. Now, the rapidly expanding "daily fantasy" or "DFS" industry is quickly becoming the new alternative with sports fans. Industry leaders have reported annual growth of daily fantasy sports of close to 300% over the past several years, with in excess of 40 million active players. According to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA), daily fantasy sports revenue in 2014 was around $1 billion and is projected to grow to $17 billion by 2020. With endorsements by professional sports organizations including the NFL, MLB, and NBA along with credible media outlets and organizations including Yahoo!, CBS, Rotowire, and more, daily fantasy sports is quickly becoming commonplace. We believe there is a large and growing market opportunity for our AmpedFantasy, Fantify, and SportsAlert products.  The Company received a Final Office Action rejecting the company's claims to U.S. App No.: 13/559,503 - Ads with Media Streams - RAD-0045.  Key Metrics:  We track listener hours because we believe it is the best key indicator of the growth of our Platform business. Revenues from advertising through our Platform represented substantially all of our revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2016. We also track the number of active users on our Platform as well as the RadioLoyaltyTM app as indicators of the size and quality of our audience, which are particularly important to potential advertisers.  We calculate actual listener hours using our internal analytics systems. Some of our competitors do not always calculate their listener hours in the same way we do. As a result, their stated listener hours may not represent a truly comparable figure.  Player launches are defined as the number of individual times the UniversalPlayer(TM) was launched.  Registered users are defined as the number of users who have signed up for an account with us in order to access our broadcasters' content and to earn loyalty points. The number of registered users may overstate the number of actual unique individuals who have signed up for an account with us in order to earn loyalty points, as an individual may register for, and use, multiple accounts under unique registration information. This is in breach of our terms and conditions but we may not be able to effectively manage and authenticate registration information in order to ensure each user is a unique individual. We define registered users as those who have signed up with us to receive loyalty points. We calculate this by the number of submissions we receive from users signing up for our loyalty service.  We calculate listener hours as follows. When the UniversalPlayerTM is launched a session is created - this is considered the listener's start time. At one minute following the launch of the UniversalPlayerTM, we record 1 minute of listening time. If a session lasts between 1 and 59 seconds, we record 30 seconds of listening time. At ten-minute intervals following the session being created, we count each 10 minute period as listening time. So for example, if a user launched the UniversalPlayer TM at 11:00am, we will recognize 1 minute of listening time at 11:01, then 10 minutes of listening time at 11:10, 20 minutes at 11:20, etc.  Stations are defined as the total of all stations created by broadcasters that utilize the Platform. A single broadcaster may create many stations and these stations may be active or inactive.  Table of Contents  Events are user interactions such as a 10 minute interval, clicking song like/dislike, sharing what they are listening to, checking the news through our news app in the player, etc. The last event we see for the user is considered the end of their session. We then take that time minus the time the session started to determine how long the session is. So for example, if a user launched the UniversalPlayer TM at 11am, and liked a song at 11:07am, but exited the player at 11:09am, we would recognize 7 minutes of listening.   Comparison of the Nine Months Ended May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015 For the Nine For the Nine Months Ended Months Ended May 31, 2016 May 31, 2015 Revenue: Advertising $ 455,372 $ 721,583 Services 16,838 27,500 Total revenue $ 472,210 $ 749,083  Revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015, totaled $472,210 and $749,083 respectively. The period over period decline can be attributed to several factors. Video revenue decreased for the nine month period year over year by $104,639 attributable to reduced listening time, overall industry technical changes and ad related errors including Vpaid errors, ad response times, increased latency, creative errors and creative load time. Display revenue decreased for the nine month period year over year by $160,987. Tighter buying criteria by Customers as a result of quality scoring from companies such as Integral Ad Science, Doubleverify and ForensIQ also reduced buys from some Customers.   For the Nine For the Nine Months Ended Months Ended May 31, 2016 May 31, 2015 Costs of revenues: Media network $ 230,561 $ 280,591 Depreciation and amortization - 77,986 Colocation services 20,547 116,337 Broadcaster commissions 39,851 89,602 Other 1,224 3,191 Total costs of revenue $ 292,183 $ 567,707  Costs of revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015 totaled $292,183 and $567,707, respectively. We incurred substantial media network costs associated with the distribution of our content across a variety of advertising networks. Our costs of distributing our content will proportionally decrease dramatically as we reach scale. Amortization of the software that powers the Platform accounted for the majority of the depreciation recorded during 2014. In order to operate the RadioLoyaltyTM online broadcasting platform, RadioLoyaltyTM mobile and tablet apps and our ad-serving technologies, we shifted our business to primarily utilize ASW's cloud. We refer to these costs as colocation services. Our advertising sales arrangements with over 5,000 RadioLoyaltyTM stations facilitate us paying the broadcasters a monthly revenue sharing fee or license fee in exchange for advertising inventory around their content and listenership. We refer to these costs as broadcaster commissions in the event that we purchase the ad inventory. Other costs of sales include depreciation associated with computer servers, streaming costs, adserving costs, and various application technologies that support our primary product offerings.

We have a broad-based business strategy to acquire more broadcasters directly, enter into joint ventures, revenue sharing arrangements or similar contracts with internet radio station guides (aggregators), and consider mergers and acquisition targets on an ongoing basis. Product development costs were associated with continuing improvements to the software and related infrastructure for our primary product offering as well as development work on our online product portfolio including the Robot Fruit, StreamTrak, Amped Fantasy, Fantify, SportsAlert and mobile technology. We expect these costs to increase in the current fiscal year. Marketing and sales costs included compensation for our sales staff and various internet marketing-related costs. Rents were primarily related to three leases we are obligated under for our Santa Barbara, California office. Officer compensation related to a variety of accruals to the two primary executives that operate our business. Other operating costs include telecom, depreciation, utilities, travel and entertainment and various other costs of doing business.

We incurred interest expense calculated on our convertible promissory notes and fees charged by the provider of our factoring line of credit, among others. We recorded the amortization of various debt discounts associated with our convertible promissory notes. The discounts are the result of derivative liabilities in which are recorded due to the variability of the notes conversion price. The derivative liabilities have to be re-measured as of each reporting date. For the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, the re-measurement resulted in a gain (loss) on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $438,067 and $321,961, respectively. During the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company's stock price decreased substantially from August 31, 2015 and 2014 which impacted the valuation of the derivative liabilities.  We did not generate taxable profits for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015, respectively. As a result, no provision for income taxes was recorded during either period.   Comparison of the Three Months Ended May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015 For the Three For the Three Months Ended Months Ended May 31, 2016 May 31, 2015 Revenue: Advertising $ 120,041 $ 203,189 Services - 8,250 Total revenue $ 120,041 $ 211,439  Revenues for the three months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, totaled $120,041 and $211,439, respectively.

During the three months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company's stock price decreased substantially from August 31, 2015 and 2014 which impacted the valuation of the derivative liabilities.  Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of May 31, 2016 we had cash totaling $13,867. We had net a working capital deficit of $4,419,481 as of May 31, 2016, compared to a net working capital deficit of $3,684,709 as of August 31, 2015. Our principal uses of cash during the nine months ending May 31, 2016 were funding our operations.  Going Concern  The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. For the nine months ended May 31, 2016, the Company recorded an operating loss of $720,015 and a net loss of $725,634. As of May 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $3,958,692, which excluding the derivative liability was $460,789, indicating substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Management is confident but cannot guarantee that the Company will be able to raise in order to repay debts and continue operations. During the year ending August 31, 2016, the Company is obligated to make payments on certain operating leases, convertible debts, and a capital lease, among others. The Company's normal operating costs are also significant and include consulting fees, professional fees, product development costs and marketing and sales costs associated with management's business plan. Additionally, the Company is currently in default on its capital lease. If the Company defaults on this capital lease, the lessor may decide to take back its equipment. The Company has replaced its use of the equipment with ASW's cloud so if the lessor decides to take back its equipment the impact operational impact would be minimal. Since inception and through May 31, 2016, the Company has successfully raised a significant amount of capital. However, the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the successful execution of the business plan in order to become profitable. If the Company is unable to become profitable or sustain its cash flow, the Company could be forced to modify its business operations or possibly cease operations entirely.

Through a convergence of original network content and interactive product placement, StreamTrack plans to revolutionize the digital entertainment and marketing industry. WatchThis.com is an online network for original and syndicated content, for which has been developed a patent-pending advanced digital media player technology called DionyVision that provides commercial-free content with unobtrusive in-show advertising.
DionyVision incorporates enhanced product placement with user-driven requests for additional information on items pertinent to the viewer's lifestyle. WatchThis.com intends to be the leading developer of content and associated technology in support of this trending revolution in entertainment and marketing. All primary technology supporting DionyVision is automated, and capable of operating in a live environment. Video content is streamed, and all associated marketing and purchases are completed in real-time, without interrupting the DionyVision programming.
DionyVision Business Model:
•Execute revenue sharing or licensing agreements with content owners for their television, motion picture, series, user-generated content, or other video-based content (Streaming Media Content - SMC)
•Identify, tag, and encode products identified within the SMC, building a large library of tagged SMC to identify all products within it
•Use DionyVision Media Player to display SMC in addition to an unobtrusive shopping cart that allows the viewer to select a product seen in the SMC and save it to a user profile or purchase it
•Automatically generate viewer profiles through SMC and product associated selections
•Serve up profile-targeted ads in display and video formats
•Support a highly targeted email marketing platform
•Generate revenues from the sale of ads within DionyVision, product sale transaction fees, and post-viewing monetization methods
•Pay content owners a revenue-sharing fee of not more than 33% of all revenues generated using their SMC

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements




	(unaudited)





	 



	1.    


	Nature of Business





	 



	StreamTrack, Inc. (the "Company") is a digital media and technology services company. The Company provides audio and video streaming and advertising services through its RadioLoyalty


	TM


	Platform (the "Platform") to over 5,000 internet and terrestrial radio stations and other broadcast content providers. The Platform consists of a web-based and mobile player that manages streaming audio and video content, social media engagement, display and video ad serving within the web player and is also capable of replacing audio ads with video ads within the web player in a live or on-demand environment. The Company offers the Platform directly to its broadcasters and integrates or white labels its technologies with web-based internet radio guides and other web-based content providers. The Company is also continuing development of Amped Fantasy and SportsAlert™, a fantasy sports product. The Company was incorporated as a Wyoming corporation on May 6, 2008.



	 




	Basis of Presentation






	 


	The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's Form 10-K for year ended August 31, 2015.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary in order for the consolidated financial statements to be not misleading have been reflected herein.  The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ended August 31, 2016. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, StreamTrack Media, Inc. and RadioLoyalty, Inc., California corporations. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of the Company's management, the consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the Company's financial position for the periods presented.


	 




	Going Concern






	 


	The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  For the nine months ended May 31, 2016, the Company recorded an operating loss of $720,015 and a net loss of $725,634. As of May 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $3,958,692, which excluding the derivative liability was $460,789. The net loss and negative working capital indicate substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Management is confident but cannot guarantee that the Company will be able to raise additional capital in order to repay debts and continue operations. As of August 31, 2015, during fiscal 2016, the Company is obligated to make payments on certain operating leases, convertible debts, and a capital lease, among others. The Company's normal operating costs are also significant and include consulting fees, professional fees, product development costs and marketing and sales costs associated with management's business plan. Since inception and through the date of these financial statements, the Company has successfully raised a significant amount of capital through debt and equity offerings. The Company anticipates launching several new product offerings and initiating certain new significant partnerships during the fiscal year ending August 31, 2016. The Company anticipates those products and partnerships to be profitable but notes that it will require an unknown amount of capital for product development and commercial deployment. The Company will attempt to have its potential partners pay for the some of these costs but management cannot be certain that it will succeed in entering into such arrangements. Management may potentially make a business decision to move forward, delay, or cancel certain partnerships because of the Company's overall capital needs. Nonetheless, the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the successful execution of the business plan and become profitable. If the Company is unable to become profitable and sustain positive cash flow from operations, the Company could be forced to modify its business operations or possibly cease operations entirely. Management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in its operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 




	Use of Estimates




	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Estimates are used for determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation, fair values of warrants to purchase common stock, derivative liabilities and income taxes. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, the Company's financial statements could be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by U.S. GAAP and does not require management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.

	Net Loss Per Share




	 



	Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.



	 



	Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, including convertible debt instruments, preferred stock, restricted stock unit grants and detachable stock warrants. Basic and diluted net loss per share was the same for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 presented as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive.



	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 



	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", which supersedes most of the current revenue recognition requirements. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for these goods or services. New disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers are also required. This guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and early application is not permitted. Entities must adopt the new guidance using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company is currently evaluating the standard but does not expect it to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



	 



	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.2 An entity must provide certain disclosures if "conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern." The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.



	 



	The Financial Accounting Standards Board issues Accounting Standard Updates ("ASUs") to amend the authoritative literature in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). There have been a number of ASUs to date that amend the original text of ASC. The Company believes those issued to date either (i) provide supplemental guidance, (ii) are technical corrections, (iii) are not applicable to the Company or (iv) are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company.

	Fair Value





	 


	Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurements are required to be disclosed by level within the following fair value hierarchy:




	 


	Level 1– Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.




	 


	Level 2 – Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life.




	 


	Level 3 – Inputs lack observable market data to corroborate management's estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.




	 


	When determining fair value, whenever possible the Company uses observable market data, and relies on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available. Fair-value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of May 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values.

	The Company's derivative liabilities were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using significant other observable inputs. At each reporting period, the Company calculates the derivative liability using the Black-Scholes pricing model taking into account variables such as expected life, risk free interest rate, expected volatility, the fair market value of the Company's common stock and the conversion price.

	Asset Acquisition / Disposition





	 




	Asset Acquisitions




	 


	On April 24, 2015, the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Lux Digital Pictures GmbH Partners ("Lux") pursuant to which, the Company issued 800 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock for the rights to various domains, source codes, etc related to Lux's Sports Alert and Amped Fantasy Sports products. The Company determined the price of the Series C issued to be $120,000 based upon the conversion value of $150 worth of common stock for each share of Series C. The Company recorded the value of the asset as software within property and equipment on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company capitalized the value of the Series C as the products received were near completion and need limited modification prior to the Company placing into production. The expected life of the asset acquired was estimated to be 36 months.


	 




	Asset Disposition




	 


	On February 19, 2016, the Company, entered into and closed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Electric Lightwave, LLC ("Electric Lightwave"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Integra Telecom Holdings, Inc. pursuant to which, Electric Lightwave purchased from the Company certain assets related to the Company's data center located in Santa Barbara, including equipment and inventory, for a purchase price of $150,000. As of the date of the sale all the assets were fully depreciated. In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded a gain of $146,012, as rent deposit of $3,988 was transferred as part of the sale, which is recorded within gain on sale of co-location and domain on the accompanying statement of operations.

	Commitments and Contingencies





	 


	 On October 23, 2013, the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Danbury, Connecticut entered an order approving the stipulation of the parties (the "Stipulation") in the matter of ASC Recap LLC ("ASC") v. StreamTrack, Inc. Under the Stipulation, the Company agreed to issue, as settlement of liabilities owed by the Company to ASC in the aggregate amount of $766,288 (the "Claim Amount"), shares of common stock (the "Settlement Shares") as follows:


	 


	(a) In one or more tranches as necessary, 3,740,000 shares of common stock (the "Initial Issuance") and an additional 200,000 shares of common stock as a settlement fee.


	 


	(b) Through the Initial Issuance and any required additional issuances, that number of shares of common stock with an aggregate value equal to (A) the sum of  (i) the Claim Amount and (ii) reasonable attorney fees and trade execution fees in the amount of $75,000, divided by (B) the Purchase Price (defined under the Stipulation as the market price (defined as the lowest closing bid price of the Company's common stock during the valuation period set forth in the Stipulation) less the product of the Discount (equal to 25%) and the market price. The parties reasonably estimated that the fair market value of the Settlement Shares and all other amounts to be received by ASC is equal to approximately $1,100,000.


	 


	(c) If at any time during the valuation period the closing bid price of the Company's common stock is below 90% of the closing bid price on the day before an issuance date, the Company will immediately cause to be issued to ASC such additional shares as may be required to effect the purposes of the Stipulation.


	 


	(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Stipulation, the number of shares beneficially owned by ASC will not exceed 9.99% of the Company's outstanding common stock.


	 


	In connection with the Settlement Shares, the Company relied on the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) under the Securities Act.


	 


	In connection with the settlement, during the nine months ended May 31, 2015 the Company issued 336,993,000 shares of common stock to ASC in which gross proceeds of $231,725 were generated from the sale of the common shares. In connection with the transaction, ASC received fees of $59,311 and provided payments of $172,414 to settle outstanding vendor payables. There were no shares issued to ASC during the nine months ended May 31, 2016. The remaining amount on the settlement of liabilities owed by the Company to ASC is in the aggregate amount of $151,290 as of May 31, 2016. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of proceeds ASC expects to receive from the sale of these shares which will be used to satisfy the liabilities. Thus, the Company accounts for the transaction as the shares are sold and the liabilities are settled. All amounts are included within accounts payable. Shares which are held by ASC at each reporting period are accounted for as issued but not outstanding.


	 




	Legal Proceedings




	 


	The Company is potentially subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. There are no pending legal proceedings against the Company as of the date of these financial statements.

	6. Capital Lease





	 


	On March 22, 2013, the Company reached a settlement and release agreement with IBM Credit, LLC, ("IBM") the lessor associated with the Company's computer servers and software classified under capital lease. The balance owed to IBM as of March 22, 2013 was agreed to be $108,704. The Company agreed to make payments of $9,000 per month, with a final payment of $9,704 on March 1, 2014, in order to satisfy this balance. As of May 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, the Company was in default of this agreement and the amount outstanding of $54,704 is reflected as a current liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 


	 



	7. Related Party Transactions





	 


	The Company has only been operating since November 30, 2011. As a result, the Company has an extremely limited credit history. The Company's Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Executive Officer of StreamTrack Media, Inc. (the "Executives") use their personal credit cards to fund operations on a frequent basis. If the Company did not have access to these credit cards, the Company would have to rely exclusively on external sources of capital. The Company's external sources of capital are not always readily available. As a result, in time-constrained circumstances, the use of personal credit cards is necessary until such time as the Company is able to build up its own credit-worthiness and access more readily available and significant credit.




	 


	The related party payable as of May 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 consists of unpaid compensation and non-interest bearing cash advances and charges on personal credit lines made on behalf of the Company by the Executives. The balances owed to the Executives are not secured and are due on demand. Interest will be charged on these balances based upon effective credit card rates. During the nine months ended May 31, 2015, the Executives converted a significant portion of amounts due to them for unpaid compensation and other advances to long-term convertible notes payable, see Note 8 for additional information. In addition, the Executives agreed to a temporary reduction in their annual salary from $240,000 to $50,000 per annum for the period from December 1, 2014 to December 1, 2015. As of May 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, amounts due to these Executive related to accrued compensation and advances were $227,668 and $159,660, respectively.

	Debt Instruments





	 






	Asset-Based Debt Financing




	 



	On April 11, 2013, the Company executed a non-dilutive asset-based debt financing (the "Lender Financing") with a third party (the "Lender"). The Lender Financing for a line of credit, secured by all of the Company's assets. The Company's management also executed limited recourse guarantees with the Lender. Interest is payable monthly based on a floating interest rate determined based on a formula outlined in detail within the financing agreement. The Company anticipates the effective monthly interest rate charged on the outstanding balance owed to the third party will be between 3.2% and 1.1%.



	 



	On January 22, 2016, the Company executed an addendum to the Lender Financing agreement whereby the maturity date has been extended to December 15, 2016 with interest calculated at Prime plus 15.25% per annum. In the event the facility is below $750,000 prior to March 15, 2016 the interest rate shall be Prime plus 12.5%; below $500,000 prior to June 15, 2016 the interest rate shall be Prime plus 10%.



	 




	Vendor Convertible Note




	 


	On November 1, 2012, the Company issued a convertible note for $140,000 (the "Vendor Note") to a former Vendor ("Vendor"). The Vendor Note was executed on November 1, 2012 and was immediately convertible into the Company's common stock at a 50% discount to the lowest bid price for the five days prior to the conversion date. As of August 31, 2015, the note was fully converted. 


	 




	Creditor #2 Convertible Promissory Notes




	 



	In April 2014, the Creditor entered into an exchange agreement with another lender (the "Creditor #2") whereby the Creditor transferred the Creditor's notes and accrued interest to Creditor #2. In April, the Company entered into i) a note agreement for $284,560 representing amounts transferred from the Creditor; ii) two $125,000 notes in which the proceeds were received on the same date (collectively referred to as the "Creditor #2 Notes") with Creditor #2. The Creditor #2 Notes bear interest per annum at 10.0%, payable six months after the issuance date and are convertible on the date of issuance based upon based upon a 45% discount to lowest trading price, for the 15 trading days prior to conversion. As a result, the lower the stock price at the time the Creditor #2 converts the Creditor #2 Notes, the more common shares the Creditor #2 will receive. There were no conversions during the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and thus the remaining principal balance was $391,242 as of May 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015.

	To the extent the Creditor #2 converts the Creditor #2 Notes and then sells its common stock, the market price of the common stock may decrease due to the additional shares in the market. This could allow the Creditor #2 to receive greater amounts of common stock upon conversion. The sale of each share of common stock could further depress the stock price. Due to the floating conversion price of the notes, the Company does not know the exact number of shares that the Creditor #2 would be issued upon conversion. The shares issuable upon conversion of the Creditor #2 Notes may result in substantial dilution to the interests of the Company's other shareholders. In this regard, even though the investor may not hold shares amounting to more than 9.99% of the outstanding shares at one time, this restriction does not prevent the investor from selling some of its holdings and then receiving additional shares. In this way, the investor could sell more than the 9.99% limit while never holding more than the limit.



	 



	During the nine months ended February 28, 2015, the Company amortized a discount of $62,500 to interest expense. As of August 31, 2015, the discount was fully amortized.



	 




	Creditor #3 Convertible Promissory Note




	 



	In December 2014, a convertible promissory note holder ("Holder") entered into an exchange agreement with another lender (the "Creditor #3") whereby the Holder transferred the Holder's notes and accrued interest to Creditor #3. In December 2014, the Company entered into i) a note agreement for $150,000 representing the principal amount transferred from the Holder. The Creditor #3 Note bears interest per annum at 10.0%, due on August 22, 2015 and is convertible on the date of issuance based upon based upon a 25% discount to lowest trading price, for the 5 trading days prior to conversion. As a result, the lower the stock price at the time the Creditor #3 converts the Creditor #3 Notes, the more common shares the Creditor #3 will receive. There were no conversions during the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and thus the remaining principal balance was $93,350 as of May 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015.



	 



	To the extent the Creditor #3 converts the Creditor #3 Note and then sells its common stock, the market price of the common stock may decrease due to the additional shares in the market. This could allow the Creditor #3 to receive greater amounts of common stock upon conversion. The sale of each share of common stock could further depress the stock price. Due to the floating conversion price of the notes, the Company does not know the exact number of shares that the Creditor #3 would be issued upon conversion. The shares issuable upon conversion of the Creditor #3 Note may result in substantial dilution to the interests of the Company's other shareholders. In this regard, even though the investor may not hold shares amounting to more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares at one time, this restriction does not prevent the investor from selling some of its holdings and then receiving additional shares. In this way, the investor could sell more than the 4.99% limit while never holding more than the limit.



	 



	Upon issuance, the Company recorded a discount of $150,000 due to the derivative liability, as discussed below in Note 9, having a fair market value in excess of the principal amount of the convertible note. As of August 31, 2015, the discount was fully amortized.



	 




	Convertible Promissory Notes




	 


	As of May 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, the Company has outstanding 38 and 33 convertible promissory notes respectively issued between December 2011 and September 2015. The convertible promissory notes bear interest at either 4% or 8% per year and are due in full, including principal and interest, two-three years from the issuance date ranging from August 2014 to February 2018. The convertible promissory notes also include a conversion option whereby the holders may elect at any time to convert any portion or the entire balance into the Company's common stock at conversion prices ranging from $0.0001 to $1.25. There were no transactions in which impacted the convertible notes payable during the nine months ended May 31, 2016, other than the accrual of interest. As of May 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, the balance of convertible notes payable was $1,702,120 and $1,615,120 respectively.




	 



	As of May 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, convertible promissory notes outstanding of $1,153,964 and $1,068,964 respectively, are held by related parties. These related parties consist of the Company's officers, former officers, significant shareholders or entities controlled by these individuals. As of May 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, $938,464 and $197,850, respectively, of these notes were included within the current portion of convertible promissory notes on the accompanying balance sheet as the note was due within one year of the balance sheet.



	 



	For some of the convertible promissory notes, the conversion feature associated with the convertible promissory notes provide for a rate of conversion that is below market value. This conversion feature is accounted for as a beneficial conversion feature. A beneficial conversion feature was recorded and classified as a debt discount on the balance sheet at the time of issuance of each convertible promissory note with a corresponding credit to additional paid-in capital.



	 



	In addition, six of the convertible promissory note purchasers were issued warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock. The valuation of the stock warrants and the beneficial conversion feature associated with the issuance of convertible promissory notes utilized valuation inputs and related figures provided by a professional and independent valuation firm. The Company allocated a portion of the proceeds received from the convertible promissory notes to the warrants using the relative fair value resulting in a debt discount to each convertible promissory note.



	 



	The discounts are amortized over the term of the convertible promissory note using the straight line method. The amortized value for each period is recorded as an offset against the debt discount on the balance sheet, classified as interest expense. During the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, $370,463 and $427,390 of the discounts were amortized to interest expense, respectively. As of May 31, 2016, $247,324 discounts remained which will be expensed in fiscal 2016 through 2018.



	 




	Future Maturities






	 



	As of August 31, 2015, future maturities of notes payable is as follows for the years ending August 31; $957,442 current; $1,067,270 2017; and $75,000 2018. Included within those amounts due to related parties are: $197,820 current and $871,114 for 2017.

	Creditor #2 Note




	 


	The Creditor #2 Notes were executed on April 15, 2014 and were immediately convertible into the Company's common stock at a 45% discount to the lowest trading price for the 15 days prior to the conversion date. As a result of the fact that the number of shares the Creditor #2 Notes was convertible into was indeterminable, the Company determined a derivative liability was embedded within the Creditor #2 Notes. The Company measured the derivative liability using the input attributes disclosed below and recorded a derivative liability of $3,158,190 as of April 15, 2014 of which $1,219,891 was included within "change in fair value of derivatives" due to a portion of the derivative liability being in excess of the $250,000 in proceeds received and $1,481,723, which included offset of $206,576 from relief of the derivative liability related to the Creditor Notes, within "Loss on extinguishment" due to extinguishment accounting on the Creditor Note transferred to Creditor #2.


	 


	On May 31, 2016, the Company re-measured the derivative liability using the input attributes below and determined the value to be $330,777 of which $275,921 was classified as income within "change in fair value of derivatives" and was recorded for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 in the statement of operations.

	Creditor #3 Note




	 



	The Creditor #3 Note was immediately convertible into the Company's common stock at a 25% discount to the lowest traded price for the five days prior to the conversion date. As a result of the fact that the number of shares the Creditor #3 is convertible into is indeterminable, the Company determined a derivative liability was embedded within the Creditor #3. The Company measured the derivative liability using the input attributes disclosed below and recorded a derivative liability of $50,000 as of December 24, 2014. As a result of the valuation of the derivative liability being in excess of the value of the carrying value of Creditor #3 by $50,000, a loss on derivative liability of $50,000 was recorded by the Company.



	 



	On May 31, 2016, the Company re-measured the derivative liability using the input attributes below and determined the value to be $38,709 of which $64,100 was classified as income within "change in fair value of derivatives" and was recorded for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 in the statement of operations.

	As discussed in Note 8, on December 24, 2014 the Company issued a $72,890 promissory note to a third party. The convertible promissory note was immediately convertible into the Company's common stock at a 10% discount to the lowest traded price for the five days prior to the conversion date. As a result of the fact that the number of shares the promissory note is convertible into is indeterminable, the Company determined a derivative liability was embedded within the promissory note. The Company measured the derivative liability using the input attributes disclosed below and recorded a derivative liability of $94,487 as of December 24, 2014. As a result of the valuation of the derivative liability being in excess of the value of the carrying value of convertible promissory note by $21,597, a loss on derivative liability of $21,597 was recorded by the Company. In addition, on March 17, 2015 the Company received an additional $41,459 in proceeds under the promissory note. On March 17, 2015, the Company recorded an additional derivative liability of $69,098, resulting in a loss on derivative liability of $27,639.



	 



	On May 31, 2016, the Company re-measured the derivative liability using the input attributes below and determined the value to be $56,286 of which $67,281 was classified as income within "change in fair value of derivatives" and was recorded for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 in the statement of operations.

	As discussed in Note 8, on April 28, 2015 the Company issued a $56,806 promissory note to a third party. The convertible promissory note was immediately convertible into the Company's common stock at a 15% discount to the lowest traded price for the five days prior to the conversion date. As a result of the fact that the number of shares the promissory note is convertible into is indeterminable, the Company determined a derivative liability was embedded within the promissory note. The Company measured the derivative liability using the input attributes disclosed below and recorded a derivative liability of $66,831 as of April 28, 2015.

	10. Stockholders' Equity





	 




	Series A Preferred Stock






	 


	Each share of Series A Preferred Stock has voting rights equal to the voting equivalent of the common stock into which it is convertible at the time of the vote. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are not entitled to dividends.  The Series A Preferred Stock has no preferential rights to the Company's common stock and will share in any liquidation proceeds with the common stock on an as converted basis. No shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding as of May 31, 2016.


	 




	Series B Preferred Stock






	 



	On October 25, 2013, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Series B Preferred Stock (the "Series B Certificate of Designation") with the Secretary of State of Wyoming. Pursuant to the Series B Certificate of Designation, the Company designated 200,000 shares of its blank check preferred stock as Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock will rank senior to the common stock, Series A Preferred Stock and any subsequently created series of preferred stock that does not expressly rank pari passu with or senior to the Series B Preferred Stock (the "Junior Stock"). The Series B Preferred Stock will not be entitled to dividends. In the event of a liquidation, the Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to a payment of the Stated Value of $1.00 per share prior to any payments being made in respect of the Junior Stock. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will entitle the holder to vote on all matters voted on by holders of common stock as a single class. With respect to any such vote, each share of Series B Preferred Stock will entitle the holder to cast such number of votes equal to 0.000255% of the total number of votes entitled to be cast. Effective upon the closing of a Qualified Financing, all issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically convert into common stock in an amount determined by dividing the product of the number of shares being converted and the Stated Value by the Conversion Price. The Conversion Price will be equal to the price per share of the common stock sold under the Qualified Financing (or, if the Qualified Financing involves the sale of securities convertible into common stock, by the conversion price of such convertible securities). A "Qualified Financing" is defined as the sale by the Company in a single offering of common stock or securities convertible into common stock for gross proceeds of at least $5,000,000.



	 



	On October 31, 2013, the Company entered into amendment, waiver and exchange agreements (the "Exchange Agreements") with Michael Hill (the Company's chief executive officer and director) and Aaron Gravitz (the Company's director). Under each Exchange Agreement, the Company issued to each of Mr. Hill and Mr. Gravitz 100,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock in exchange for $100,000 in unpaid compensation.



	 




	Series C Preferred Stock






	 


	Effective December 29, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series C") with the Secretary of State of Wyoming. Pursuant to the Series C, the Company designated 20,000 shares of its blank check preferred stock as Series C Preferred Stock. Each share of Series C is convertible into $150 in fair market value of the Company's common stock, which fair market value will be equal to the average closing price of the common stock on the over-the-counter market during the 10 trading days immediately prior to the delivery to the Company of a conversion notice. The Series C will share in any liquidation proceeds with the common stock on an as-converted basis, will not have voting rights prior to being converted to common stock, and in the event of any payment of dividends by the Company, will be entitled to dividends on an as-converted basis with the common stock. The Company has presented the Series C outside of stockholders' equity due to the variable conversion price.


	 


	On April 24, 2015, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with Lux pursuant to which the Company issued 10,000 shares of its Series C in exchange for 1,495,313 shares of Company common stock tendered by Lux to the Company for cancellation.  The Lux common stock was originally issued to Lux by the Company on March 12, 2013. In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded a loss on settlement of $1,499,850, which represented the difference in the fair market value of the Series C issued of $1.5 million and the common stock received of $150. See Note 4 for additional transaction with Lux.


	 


	On April 24, 2015, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with Mark J. Richardson ("MJR") pursuant to which the Company issued 500 shares of its Series C in exchange for 15,140 shares of Company common stock tendered by MJR to the Company for cancellation.  The MJR common stock was originally issued to MJR by the Company on March 13, 2013.

	Common Stock






	 


	Each share of common stock has the right to one vote per share. The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the board of directors of the Company, whenever funds are legally available, subject to the rights under any outstanding preferred stock.


	 


	Effective February 17, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Wyoming to (i) increase the Company's authorized shares of common stock from 1,000,000,000 to an unlimited number; and (ii) allow for shareholders to take actions by the written consent of the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be required to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and voted.


	 


	On October 26, 2015, the Company filed a Preliminary Schedule 14C Information Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with approval by the Company's board of directors and majority stockholders of an amendment the Articles of Incorporation to: (i) change the Company's name from StreamTrack, Inc. to Total Sports Media, Inc., (ii) effect a 1-for 800 reverse split of the Company's common stock and (iii) decrease the authorized number of shares of common stock from an unlimited number to 40,000,000. The amendment will be effective upon filing with the Secretary of State of Wyoming, which the Company anticipates to occur approximately, but not less than, 20 days after the definitive information statement is mailed to stockholders.


	 


	During the nine months ended May 31, 2016, 530 shares of Series C with a value of $79,500 were converted into 795,000,000 shares of common stock.

Upon exercise, RTV has up to five years to exercise the warrants. In addition, RTV agreed to invest up to an additional $425,000 of capital into the Company in consideration for which additional warrants will be granted upon investment.

	Overview





	 


	StreamTrack, Inc. ("StreamTrack," or the "Company") is a digital media and technology services company. The Company provides audio and video streaming and advertising services through the RadioLoyalty


	TM


	Platform (the "Platform") to a global group of over 5,000 internet and terrestrial radio stations and other broadcast content providers. We also developing Robot Fruit, which is intended to be a powerful marketing tool that combines a mobile app creation platform, customer loyalty program, and content management system into an instant and measurable marketing engine for businesses. The Company is also continuing development of StreamTrak, designed to enable fans, artists, bands, music publishers and record labels to distribute, discover, create and share content.In addition, the Company through ampedfantasy.com has entered the rapidly growing daily fantasy sports industry. The Amped Fantasy brand will offer diverse contests to attract fans of all kinds. The mobile and web offering which is under development will include, but not be limited to free and paid daily, weekly, pick'em, salary cap, flex or customized roster and guaranteed prize or payout contests. Fantify which is under development, is a fully customizable daily fantasy sports and private label fantasy sports technology platform. Once venues signup for Fantify and setup a contest, they invite new or existing customers, and award prizes. It will be free to play for customers to win prizes, compete against friends and others, feel closer to the real life game, and all with no season-long commitment. Through sportsalert.com the Company owns a subscriber based alert system for various sports with over 100,000 registered users. Users can choose whether they want score updates sent to their mobile phone or email, customizable by sport and events.




	 


	Our streaming business model is focused on the following core principles:




	 









	1.






	We barter with audio content providers, namely internet and terrestrial radio stations, to obtain control and management of their desktop advertising opportunity ("Ad Inventory"). We also routinely purchase any Ad Inventory the content providers have not previously transferred to us by barter.










	 




	 








	2.






	In exchange for the Ad Inventory, we pay for all internet and mobile streaming costs associated with the broadcaster's content that is streamed through our platform. We barter in order to scale our business. The end result of the barter is that we aggregate Ad Inventory from broadcasters that management believes can reach substantial size while maintaining a primarily fixed cost structure for our hardware, content delivery, labor and other costs, respectively.










	 




	 








	3.






	We re-broadcast original audio broadcast content through the Platform in a streaming media format in desktop and mobile environments. By re-broadcasting we ensure that we do not pay any royalties. Royalties are the responsibility of our broadcasters. This is a substantial advantage for us as many of our competitors pay royalties of up to 70% of revenues generated from licensed broadcast content.










	 




	 








	4.






	We serve advertisements ("Ads") within the Platform in audio, display and video formats in a desktop environment and display ads in a mobile environment using our RadioLoyalty


	TM


	Apps.










	 




	 








	5.






	Ads are served by our automated systems based on geography and demographics data, among others.










	 




	 








	6.






	The primary technology that makes our Platform unique in the industry is that we are able to re-broadcast audio content with geographically targeted Ads that replace Ads served within an original broadcast targeting a listener in a certain geography. By having this capability we can also choose to replace audio Ads that do not generate as high of Ad revenues with video-based Ads that generate much higher Ad revenues. In effect, we make the broadcaster's original broadcast capable of delivering Ads that are geographically targeted throughout a global broadcast marketplace while also utilizing video Ads and our proprietary video in-stream technology to increase advertising rates.










	 




	 








	7.






	All of our primary technology that supports the Platform is automated and capable of operating in a live environment. Audio content is streamed, Ads are targeted and served, audio Ads are replaced as needed and video Ads replace audio Ads, as desired and when possible.







	 


	Advertising revenue constitutes the majority of our total revenue, representing 96.4% of total revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2016. We anticipate this trend will continue and our revenues will be generated primarily from advertising. Our advertising revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 was almost entirely derived from advertising delivered on desktop devices.




	 


	We deliver content on mobile devices through our RadioLoyalty


	TM


	app but we do not currently generate significant mobile advertising revenues. Management believes that mobile advertising represents an opportunity for the Company in the coming years and on an ongoing basis. Management expects the mobile advertising market will grow at substantial rates in the coming years. However, many challenges exist in this market. We believe these challenges will be solved primarily with new technologies. We believe our current technologies and other technology under development will solve some of these challenges. By solving these challenges, we will be able to monetize the mobile listenership we are growing today.

	In June 2015, the Company received an Office Action where the examiner laid out new grounds of rejection addressed to the new claim language from our previous amendment to U.S. App No.: 12/146,922 - WATCH THIS - RAD-00330. Claims 20, 22-27, 36, and 38-43 were rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over US 2006/0089843 filed 10/26/2004 by Flather in view of US 2008/0307454 filed 6/6/08 by Ahanger et al in view of US 2008/0109844 filed 11 /2/06 by Baldeschwieler et al. in view of US 2013/0061262 with priority to 1 /30/0S, filed by Briggs et al. The Company had until June 19, 2015 to respond to this decision, and while the Company believes that its claims are patentable, it choose not to pursue the claims further because it would have been cost prohibitive.


	 


	The Company is exploring alternative options as it relates to the WatchThis technology. On February 2, 2016 the Company sold the domain name www.watchthis.com for $30,000. While the USPTO has rejected our claims put forth, management believes that the viability of the technology is still feasible. Currently we have stopped development of this product until management identifies all of the options that are available for the business to potentially pursue.


	 


	In November 2013, we completed an asset purchase of RobotFruit, a mobile loyalty and application platform. Robot Fruit provides a complete SAAS based mobile platform for publishers and content owners to directly sell their mobile web and in-app ad inventory on leading mobile devices. The platform is a self-service mobile loyalty and development platform that has an easy to use interface which enables station owners, content owners, business owners, artists and bands to quickly deploy in HTML5, native iOS and Android based application environments. We anticipate making the technology available to broadcasters, content owners and artists in the coming months.


	 


	In April 2015, we completed an asset purchase of Amped Fantasy and SportsAlert™, a daily fantasy sports and alert platform. Amped Fantasy provides a complete daily fantasy sports web based platform where players compete to win cash and prizes. The platform is designed with an easy to use interface which enables players to compete across all major professional sports events. SportsAlert is an alert messaging platform that allows subscribers to obtain current stats and scores relating to teams or individual players performances. The daily fantasy sports industry is experiencing rapid growth. Traditional fantasy sports games have been an integral part of the sports industry for decades. Now, the rapidly expanding "daily fantasy" or "DFS" industry is quickly becoming the new alternative with sports fans. Industry leaders have reported annual growth of daily fantasy sports of close to 300% over the past several years, with in excess of 40 million active players. According to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA), daily fantasy sports revenue in 2014 was around $1 billion and is projected to grow to $17 billion by 2020. With endorsements by professional sports organizations including the NFL, MLB, and NBA along with credible media outlets and organizations including Yahoo!, CBS, Rotowire, and more, daily fantasy sports is quickly becoming commonplace. We believe there is a large and growing market opportunity for our AmpedFantasy, Fantify, and SportsAlert products.


	 


	The Company received a Final Office Action rejecting the company's claims to U.S. App No.: 13/559,503 - Ads with Media Streams - RAD-0045.


	 



	Key Metrics:





	 


	We track listener hours because we believe it is the best key indicator of the growth of our Platform business. Revenues from advertising through our Platform represented substantially all of our revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2016. We also track the number of active users on our Platform as well as the RadioLoyalty


	TM


	app as indicators of the size and quality of our audience, which are particularly important to potential advertisers.


	 


	We calculate actual listener hours using our internal analytics systems. Some of our competitors do not always calculate their listener hours in the same way we do. As a result, their stated listener hours may not represent a truly comparable figure.




	 


	Player launches are defined as the number of individual times the UniversalPlayer™ was launched.




	 


	Registered users are defined as the number of users who have signed up for an account with us in order to access our broadcasters' content and to earn loyalty points. The number of registered users may overstate the number of actual unique individuals who have signed up for an account with us in order to earn loyalty points, as an individual may register for, and use, multiple accounts under unique registration information. This is in breach of our terms and conditions but we may not be able to effectively manage and authenticate registration information in order to ensure each user is a unique individual. We define registered users as those who have signed up with us to receive loyalty points. We calculate this by the number of submissions we receive from users signing up for our loyalty service.




	 


	We calculate listener hours as follows. When the UniversalPlayer


	TM


	is launched a session is created - this is considered the listener's start time. At one minute following the launch of the UniversalPlayer


	TM


	, we record 1 minute of listening time. If a session lasts between 1 and 59 seconds, we record 30 seconds of listening time. At ten-minute intervals following the session being created, we count each 10 minute period as listening time. So for example, if a user launched the UniversalPlayer

	TM

	at 11:00am, we will recognize 1 minute of listening time at 11:01, then 10 minutes of listening time at 11:10, 20 minutes at 11:20, etc.




	 


	Stations are defined as the total of all stations created by broadcasters that utilize the Platform. A single broadcaster may create many stations and these stations may be active or inactive.

	Events are user interactions such as a 10 minute interval, clicking song like/dislike, sharing what they are listening to, checking the news through our news app in the player, etc. The last event we see for the user is considered the end of their session. We then take that time minus the time the session started to determine how long the session is. So for example, if a user launched the UniversalPlayer

	TM

	at 11am, and liked a song at 11:07am, but exited the player at 11:09am, we would recognize 7 minutes of listening.

The period over period decline can be attributed to several factors. Video revenue decreased for the nine month period year over year by $104,639 attributable to reduced listening time, overall industry technical changes and ad related errors including Vpaid errors, ad response times, increased latency, creative errors and creative load time. Display revenue decreased for the nine month period year over year by $160,987. Tighter buying criteria by Customers as a result of quality scoring from companies such as Integral Ad Science, Doubleverify and ForensIQ also reduced buys from some Customers.

Our costs of distributing our content will proportionally decrease dramatically as we reach scale. Amortization of the software that powers the Platform accounted for the majority of the depreciation recorded during 2014. In order to operate the RadioLoyalty

	stations facilitate us paying the broadcasters a monthly revenue sharing fee or license fee in exchange for advertising inventory around their content and listenership. We refer to these costs as broadcaster commissions in the event that we purchase the ad inventory.

	Operating expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $900,042 and $853,062, respectively. We have a broad-based business strategy to acquire more broadcasters directly, enter into joint ventures, revenue sharing arrangements or similar contracts with internet radio station guides (aggregators), and consider mergers and acquisition targets on an ongoing basis. Product development costs were associated with continuing improvements to the software and related infrastructure for our primary product offering as well as development work on our online product portfolio including the Robot Fruit, StreamTrak, Amped Fantasy, Fantify, SportsAlert and mobile technology. We expect these costs to increase in the current fiscal year. Marketing and sales costs included compensation for our sales staff and various internet marketing-related costs. Rents were primarily related to three leases we are obligated under for our Santa Barbara, California office. Officer compensation related to a variety of accruals to the two primary executives that operate our business. Other operating costs include telecom, depreciation, utilities, travel and entertainment and various other costs of doing business.

	Other (expense) income for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, totaled $(5,619) and $(2,316,692), respectively. We incurred interest expense calculated on our convertible promissory notes and fees charged by the provider of our factoring line of credit, among others. We recorded the amortization of various debt discounts associated with our convertible promissory notes. The discounts are the result of derivative liabilities in which are recorded due to the variability of the notes conversion price. The derivative liabilities have to be re-measured as of each reporting date. For the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, the re-measurement resulted in a gain (loss) on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $438,067 and $321,961, respectively. During the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company's stock price decreased substantially from August 31, 2015 and 2014 which impacted the valuation of the derivative liabilities.




	 


	We did not generate taxable profits for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015, respectively. As a result, no provision for income taxes was recorded during either period.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources





	 


	As of May 31, 2016 we had cash totaling $13,867. We had net a working capital deficit of $4,419,481 as of May 31, 2016, compared to a net working capital deficit of $3,684,709 as of August 31, 2015. Our principal uses of cash during the nine months ending May 31, 2016 were funding our operations.


	 




	Going Concern






	 


	The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  For the nine months ended May 31, 2016, the Company recorded an operating loss of $720,015 and a net loss of $725,634. As of May 31, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of $3,958,692, which excluding the derivative liability was $460,789, indicating substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Management is confident but cannot guarantee that the Company will be able to raise in order to repay debts and continue operations. During the year ending August 31, 2016, the Company is obligated to make payments on certain operating leases, convertible debts, and a capital lease, among others. The Company's normal operating costs are also significant and include consulting fees, professional fees, product development costs and marketing and sales costs associated with management's business plan. Additionally, the Company is currently in default on its capital lease. If the Company defaults on this capital lease, the lessor may decide to take back its equipment. The Company has replaced its use of the equipment with ASW's cloud so if the lessor decides to take back its equipment the impact operational impact would be minimal. Since inception and through May 31, 2016, the Company has successfully raised a significant amount of capital. However, the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the successful execution of the business plan in order to become profitable. If the Company is unable to become profitable or sustain its cash flow, the Company could be forced to modify its business operations or possibly cease operations entirely. Management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in its operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 




	Working Capital Related Party Financing






	 


	The Company has only been operating since November 30, 2011. As a result, the Company has an extremely limited credit history. The Company's Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Executive Officer of StreamTrack Media, Inc. use their personal credit cards to fund operations on a frequent basis. If the Company did not have access to these credit cards, the Company would have to rely exclusively on external sources of capital. The Company's external sources of capital are not always readily available. As a result, in time-constrained circumstances, the use of personal credit cards is necessary until such time as the Company is able to build up its own credit-worthiness and access more readily available and significant credit.
