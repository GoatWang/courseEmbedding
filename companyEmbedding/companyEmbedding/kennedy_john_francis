Kathleen & Joe Mom just informed me today of John's passing.   I wish I had known about this last week, since I would have attended John's service at St. John of Arc.   I still remember John's beautiful and innocent spirit during the many fond memories I have when playing in our back yard and neighborhood as a kid.   Seeing John and you at my Brother David's funeral 2-years ago brought back some of those memories.    May God bless your special John and your family.   Mark Aventino
