ABP will apply the proceeds from the offering to pay for accounting, legal and
other professional fees associated with the offering. The total estimated costs
of the offering ($30,000) are less than the maximum offering proceeds ($55,000)
thereby providing us with approximately $25,000 of available funds for working
capital purposes. The costs of the offering, which principally relate to
professional costs, are estimated to be:

                     SEC registration fee         $      6.37
                     NASD filing fee                   100.00
                     Accounting fees and expenses    5,000.00
                     Transfer agent fees             2,500.00
                     Blue sky fees and expenses      5,000.00
                     Miscellaneous expenses          2,393.63
                     Legal fees and expenses        15,000.00
                                                             
                     Total                        $ 30,000.00

As funds are obtained from the sale of shares, offering costs will be paid in
the sequence listed in the table regardless of the amount of dollars collected.
If all of the registered shares are sold, all costs will be paid for in full
including our legal fees which currently amount to $15,000. From the maximum
offering proceeds, we will pay for the various expenses associated with this
offering which amount to approximately $30,000, leaving an estimated $25,000 in
cash on hand for general operating expenses, materials and supplies for business
operations.

Upon starting preparation of the Form S-1, we paid our legal counsel $7,500 as
partial payment towards our estimated legal fees. Our legal counsel has
informally agreed to defer a portion of their fees until this offering becomes
effective, which may be asserted as providing financing to the Company. Our
plans will not change regardless of whether the maximum proceeds are raised.

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the
securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will
raise the full $55,000 as anticipated.

Offering expenses described in the table above and below on Page 19, total
$30,000.00. This is an approximation of the total costs that we believe that we
will incur in conducting our offering. The SEC registration fee was $6.37 which
we paid upon submitting our Form S-1 registration statement to the Commission.
The NASD filing fee is estimated to be $100.00, which we will pay upon obtaining
a quotation of our common stock. We believe the NASD filing fee is a
pass-through cost. Accounting fees and expenses are estimated at $5,000.00, part
of which we have already paid to our PCAOB independent accounting firm to audit
our financial statements and to review financial statements that set forth our
interim financial information. Transfer agent fees are estimated to be
$2,500.00, which will be used to pay our transfer agent upon issuance of our
shares of common stock to our investors and other service fees that our transfer
agent will charge us. Blue sky fees and expenses are estimated to be $2,500.00,
which we will use to pay certain states in order to obtain blue-sky
qualification and approval. Some of the transfer agent fees and blue sky fees
may be used for legal expenses that may be associated with such services.
Miscellaneous expenses are estimated to be $2,393.63 for accounting, printing,
postage, travel, bank charges and fees, and other costs that are directly
related to our offering. Legal fees are estimated to be $15,000.00, which will
be used to pay our legal counsel, Jessica Nguyen Law. The foregoing costs are an
estimate of the offering expenses we will incur.

                                                     Assuming the sale of:

* Note – if we are not able to sell more than 50% of our offering, all of the 
  offering proceeds will be used to pay for offering expenses, leaving nothing
  for working capital and business operations.

ˠ Note – Offering expense, the total of which is an estimate, is further
  explained above and includes the following line items as part of this table:
  (i) Miscellaneous expenses attributable to offering, (ii) Accounting fees and
  expenses, and (iii) Legal fees and expenses.
                                                                                
** Note – Miscellaneous expenses per this table consists of the SEC registration
   fee of $6.37, NASD filing fee of $100.00, Blue sky fees and expenses of
   $5,000.00, transfer agent fees and costs of $2,500.00, and miscellaneous
   expenses which consists of various filing fees, copying costs, 
   non-accounting, non-transfer agent and non-legal fees and costs. These costs
   will be paid first in first out.

As shown in the table above, if 50% or less of the offering is raised, all the
proceeds will be used to pay expenses associated with the offering and no
proceeds will be available to execute our business plan. In the event 75% or
100% of the offering is raised, the proceeds will first be used to pay offering
expenses and the nominal remaining proceeds will be used primarily to expand on
our inventory and develop our marketing program according to the phases of our
overall business plan. However, the above figures represent only estimated 
costs. If necessary, Ms. Chardi, our president and director, has verbally agreed
to loan the Company funds or to seek additional outside financing from former
acquaintances to allow the Company to complete the registration process, to 
further its business objectives, and to otherwise utilize the proceeds of such
loans or outside financing as it sees fit. Specifically, Ms. Chardi has agreed
that she will loan the Company funds if she is financially capable of doing so,
which she is currently not able to do; it is likely she will seek outside
financing from personal and professional acquaintances. Loan funds from Ms.
Chardi’s acquaintances may contain limitations on how such funds can be used,
but the Company will endeavor to negotiate as little limitations as possible
when accepting such funds. These loans (whether from Ms. Chardi or from Ms.
Chardi’s acquaintances) are necessary if the proceeds from this offering are not
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain our reporting status and
quotation if our common stock ever becomes eligible for trading. Ms. Chardi will
not be paid any sort of compensation from the proceeds of this offering. We are
not required to repay any funds advanced by Ms. Chardi or other lenders by any
particular date or under any certain circumstances; however, we expect to repay
Ms. Chardi and other lenders from revenues if and when we generate enough
revenue to pay our financial obligations. We are under no immediate obligation
to use the offering proceeds to repay the current lenders of the Company (of
which Ms. Chardi is one) or our vendors who have provided us significant
services for our operations. Management believes this to be the case despite the
fact that the Company has approximately $42,000 in demand loans from two former
associates of Ms. Chardi. What this means is that the Company would be obligated
to repay these loans upon the demand of Ms. Chardi’s two former associates that
these loans be repaid. However, the Company will seek to delay any payment of
the demand loans as long as possible and practicable. This could involve the
Company renegotiating those loans to provide for interest payments and/or
accruals as well as determinative repayment dates that may exceed one year in
length. We have not had any formal conversations about the above with either of
the lenders or our vendors as of the date of this Prospectus.

In order to execute our business plan, we must complete 100% of this offering
and also seek additional financing. Even if we receive 75%, 50% or even 25% of
the offering amount (as demonstrated in the Dilution Table below), our ability
to execute our business plan is limited because we will need additional
financing. Achieving the maximum offering proceeds is a necessary step. And
securing additional financing is critical to the timeline we set forth below. If
and when we secure approximately $100,000 on top of our offering, we should be
able to take our business plan through the phases outlined below. The additional
funds will be used: (1) to engage or hire employees or outside consultants to
round out the skills of our founder in the execution of her business plan; and
(2) for additional costs projected to be incurred over the next 12 months.

Phase 1 (3-4 months in duration; $30,000 est. costs)

Phase 2 (3-4 months in duration; $30,000 est. costs)

Phase 3 (3-4 months in duration; $40,000 est. costs)

$100,000 - Total Costs for Phase 1 through Phase 3

We believe our intended product offering (when ready for the marketplace) could
begin to generate limited revenues within 120 to 150 days after we have both
completed the offering and received additional financing. Continued business
growth through product placement and marketing efforts are critically
conditioned upon receiving additional financing as our current resources are
insufficient to pursue these and other actions. Again these costs will need to
be covered through additional financing which could be in the form of debt or
equity.


The hair-care business and the all-natural organic product business in general,
is highly competitive. We will compete with hundreds of small, medium and large
sized business entities, including but not limited to multi-national
manufacturers and highly specialized organic product companies. Many of our
competitors’ products are well known and trusted by the consumer. Virtually all
of our competitors have greater financial and operational resources than we do.
Our competitors have the ability to spend more aggressively on advertising and
marketing, spend more on product development and testing, and have more
flexibility than we do to respond to changing business and market conditions.
Some of our competitors are able to survive on the strength of their brand name
alone. When they introduce a new product to the marketplace, whether it be
hair-care or another beauty product, consumers are not so wary to try the new
product as they would be with us. Competition in the hair-care business is based
on pricing, quality, innovation, perceived value, promotional activities,
advertising, product introductions, name recognition, and a host of other
factors. It is difficult for us to predict how we will be able to compete with
our competitors in these areas.

We believe through the efforts of outside marketing and advertising
professionals, we can prepare effective marketing and consumer-directed
materials that will inform consumers of the benefits our products when fully
developed, assuming we have the financial resources to engage these 
professionals. We produced samples of our intended products for consumer testing
and have received positive results. The results and responses to date have been
from a small sample of consumers in a non-scientific manner. These results
although anecdotal have driven us to improve upon the product formulas and
pursue a retail market for these products when ready. Anecdotal marketing
through these consumers through their friends and family members has generated a
strong but small product demand. Even without a retail product available, we
have received requests to manufacture the products for use.

We will compete using our internal and external contacts to develop business
opportunities, and to meet with potential distributors and distribution channel
managers, with whom we may attempt to partner despite our limited resources.
These opportunities we believe will come from contacts and referrals, our
product formulator’s contacts and referrals, as well as other industry
professionals with their contacts and referrals. The availability of these
business opportunities will depend upon our ability to secure sufficient funding
for product development, manufacturing, and sales, marketing and advertising
efforts. We cannot predict the likelihood or timing for our success. No
assurances can be given that our competitive strategy will have any success.


Company Description
Allegro Beauty Products, Inc. is in the business of developing, manufacturing,
marketing and selling the Allegro Hair-Care Collection, a hair-care line that
combines exacting science with nature to form what we believe is an advanced
hair-care treatment using all-natural ingredients. Specifically,


 ABP believes it
has developed a proprietary formula, “Allegro Organics”, which is a unique
combination of jojoba oil, emu oil, olive oil, aloe vera gel, anhydrous lanolin,
walnut oil, safflower oil, macadamia oil and a host of other all-natural
ingredients to rejuvenate hair follicles and the scalp. “Allegro Organics” is
the foundational element of each product in the Allegro Hair-Care Collection.

ABP’s hair-care products consist of a special blend of essential oils, other
natural binders and cleansers, and the “Allegro Organics” blend. The Company
believes its formula can be used in the development of multiple hair-care
products for daily use by the organic and natural product conscious consumer and
brought to market without significant costs. In fact, ABP is developing its
Allegro Hair-Care Collection to be a full spectrum of hair-care products
designed to naturally improve hair follicles and scalp wellness and provide hair
revitalizing properties. Our products are intended to deliver dramatic
improvement in the general health, well-being and increased vitality for great
looking hair. We believe that our quality ingredients will be considered a
primary difference between our all-natural, organic product and other
conventional hair-care products.

Testimonials















I tried the vitamin Hydraskin anti aging cream at an local store. I then wanted something else to tighten pores and get rid of black heads on the t zone. I ordered the silver powder it is wonderful and the lifting mask outstanding I got some samples of the Hydraskin drops and the Hydraskin foaming cleanser. I then ordered these 2 items. They are wonderful.  I have combination skin and these have proven that they can make a difference in skin condition, Thank you so much for having these products that work as I have tried everything at least once.  

Andrew Kreeger | 9th April 2016













There are so many Collagen boosting creams out there that sometimes I get very confused about what to buy but something told me to try this. The price is definitely quite affordable and the ingredients list seemed quite promising so I decided to give it a try. Although I don’t have a typical beauty routine, I decided to use this more diligently because I really wanted to see some results.

Char Nystrom | 7th April 2016

											Mr. Hood

I want to thank you for choosing Trina @ 1-800-861-3211 x155 for one of your employees.  Trina was very professional and took the time to go the extra steps for me as new customer. My stepfather  will only drink supplements and your company was the only one I could fine that had this orange boost breeze drink in stock.  Trina understood the URGENT need she contacted the warehouse to ensure that the orange drink was in stock and she had the product shipped that day. Customer Service is a very rare thing this day and time. I am very happy to see company's empowerment their employees to do the right thing for the customer. Trina is a very valuable asset to your company. I hope you will pass this note along to her.

My stepfather received the drink on 11/11/2010 his smile the best smile in a while when he saw the drinks.

Thank you again for your wonderful service.

Jennie Morrison

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
