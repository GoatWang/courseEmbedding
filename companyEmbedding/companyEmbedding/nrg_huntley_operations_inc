This checklist helps you prepare with the right supplies and information.Map ViewTips & AdviceHow can I use electricity safely at home?Keep the following tips in mind:

Do not operate any electrical equipment while sitting or standing in water.
Don't overload extension cords or surge protectors.
Put caps on your electrical outlets if you have small children.
Call an electrician if you notice your sockets or switches are warm to the touch, discolored or if they make noise.
Keep electrical cords away from stoves, ovens and other sources of heat.
Do not use an appliance that has a frayed cord.
Do not staple extension cords into place or cover them with carpets or furniture.
When using extension cords, make sure to unwrap them before plugging them in.
Don't overuse extension cords. Have an electrician install extra outlets if you need a power source closer to you.
Only use light bulbs with the correct wattage for your lamps and light fixtures.
Contact a licensed electrician if you frequently blow fuses, since this can be a sign of an electrical wiring problem.
Have an electrician look at your fuse box to ensure you have the right size fuses and circuit breakers. The wrong size fuse or breaker can be a fire hazard.
If you have fault circuit interrupters installed in your electrical panel, make sure you test them at least once a month by turning them on and off.
What is the cost of hiring an  electrician?It can cost from $40-$100 an hour depending on the job. This does not include additional costs for parts or trip fees. Make sure to ask in advance what they charge for or if they will provide a free quote.What kind of training does an electrician need?In order to become a full-fledged professional, a person must undergo an apprenticeship with master and journeyman electricians. An apprentice needs 8,000 hours of practical work before graduating to the journeyman level. If an apprentice reaches journeyman status, he or she can complete most electrical work, but cannot design it until completing more testing along with 2,000 more on-the-job hours.Is there more than one kind of electrician?Yes. While all electricians need a license, not all of them do the same types of jobs.

Outside: These types of electricians work outdoors on electrical lines that connect to power plants.
Inside: Inside experts typically focus on commercial and industrial buildings that require a lot of power.
Residential: Residential electricians work with low-voltage systems and wiring to install fuse boxes and light fixtures.
Should I be worried about comparatively low price estimates from an electrician?Watch out for contractors that greatly underbid other electricians. If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Also, always remember to get the estimate in writing before settling on a company.What are the best ways to find an electrician?
Get referrals
Look online
Ask for a quote
Ask them about their experience
Be wary of suspiciously low estimates
Does electrical work require a permit?Depending on what kind of repairs or installation you need, your city could require a permit for the electrical work. Ask your electrician if the job calls for one and have him or her put the permit under his or her name. Ensuring the tradesperson obtains a permit will safeguard you from any blame if the labor turns out to be subpar.Does an electrician need a warranty?Inquire if both the labor and parts the electrician uses are under warranty and how long the work is guaranteed for.Does an electrician need a business license?Both the electrician as well as the business he or she works for need licenses either issued by the state or local municipality.Does an electrician need to be insured?Many states require contractors to carry some form of insurance along with their license. Insist that whomever you hire has the proper amount of insurance for the work you need done and call the insurer to check the policy. See that whom you hire for the job has liability and workers' compensation insurance so you don't pay for injuries or accidents caused by the company's work.See more Tips & AdviceSponsoredDidn't find what you were looking for?magnifying glass
