    	     Thomas R. ?Duke? Moon, age 75, a resident of Fairview Township, went home to be with his Great Lord, on Sunday, February 12, 2012, at Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola.  As a cancer survivor four times over, his faith in God gave him the strength to fight the good fight.  Thanks to God\'s direction in his life, he was in a clinical trial at Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Hospitals, in Nashville, TN, that was successful and made him cancer free.  

  Born in Jackson Center, PA, on February 29, 1936, he was a son of the late Kenneth and Buelah (Robson) Moon.  In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by a brother, Jack Moon, and a sister, Elsie Moon.

   He was married for over 53 years to Lucy Ann (Church) Moon, whom he wed on June 15, 1957.  Survivors include his son, Rick Moon, and wife Charlene, of Erie; a daughter, Brenda Kenyon,  and husband Paul, of San Diego, CA;  two brothers, Kenneth, wife Delores,  and Raymond, ?Dewey?, wife Judy; grandchildren, Joshua & Thomas Moon,  Adam, James and Elizabeth Kenyon, and Brianne McDaniel; several nieces and nephews.

     During the Korean War, he served in U.S. Army, 11th Airborne Division, then continued  his service in the Army Reserve and PA National Guard.
