About Us | Relypsa, Inc.





















Developing New Polymer-Based Medicines for Undertreated ConditionsRelypsa is a biopharmaceutical company leading the discovery, development and commercialization of polymer-based medicines to treat conditions that are often overlooked and undertreated, but that can have a serious impact on patient lives or even be life-threatening.

Veltassa® | Relypsa, Inc. 





















First New Medicine for the Treatment of Hyperkalemia in More than 50 Years
VELTASSA (patiromer) for oral suspension is the first commercialized medicine resulting from Relypsa’s polymer technology platform.
VELTASSA® Indication & Limitations of Use
VELTASSA is a potassium binder approved for the treatment of hyperkalemia.
VELTASSA should not be used as an emergency treatment for life-threatening hyperkalemia because of its delayed onset of action.
Please see Important Safety Information.
Click here for full Prescribing Information.
Available in powder form, VELTASSA is mixed with water and taken daily. Its smooth, spherical beads bind to potassium in exchange for calcium, primarily in the colon. The potassium is then excreted from the body through the normal excretion process. 
VELTASSA Patient Access Program
Relypsa is committed to providing people living with hyperkalemia a comprehensive network of patient support services.
Visit VELTASSA.com for more information.
ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
Important Safety Information
Contraindications Veltassa is contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to Veltassa or any of its components.
Worsening of Gastrointestinal Motility Avoid use of Veltassa in patients with severe constipation, bowel obstruction or impaction, including abnormal post-operative bowel motility disorders, because Veltassa may be ineffective and may worsen gastrointestinal conditions. Patients with a history of bowel obstruction or major gastrointestinal surgery, severe gastrointestinal disorders, or swallowing disorders were not included in clinical studies.
Hypomagnesemia Veltassa binds to magnesium in the colon, which can lead to hypomagnesemia.  In clinical studies, hypomagnesemia was reported as an adverse reaction in 5.3% of patients treated with Veltassa. Approximately 9% of patients in clinical trials developed hypomagnesemia with a serum magnesium value < 1.4 mg/dL. Monitor serum magnesium. Consider magnesium supplementation in patients who develop low serum magnesium levels.
Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2%) are constipation, hypomagnesemia, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort and flatulence. Mild to moderate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 0.3% of patients treated with Veltassa and included edema of the lips.
Please see full Prescribing Information by clicking here.

Relypsa, Inc. Competition

   Relypsa knows that too much of a good thing can be bad for your health. A pharmaceutical company, Relypsa has developed a drug to treat hyperkalemia, a potentially life-threatening condition defined by high levels of potassium in the blood caused by kidney dysfunction. The company's first commercialized medicine, Veltassa (patiromer), is an orally administered, non-absorbed drug that binds to ingested potassium and reduces its absorption by the body. Relypsa received FDA approval for Veltassa in 2015. The company went public in 2013. Swiss firm Galenica acquired Relypsa for $1.5 billion in mid-2016.

Relypsa, Inc. Company Profile

   Relypsa knows that too much of a good thing can be bad for your health. A pharmaceutical company, Relypsa has developed a drug to treat hyperkalemia, a potentially life-threatening condition defined by high levels of potassium in the blood caused by kidney dysfunction. The company's first commercialized medicine, Veltassa (patiromer), is an orally administered, non-absorbed drug that binds to ingested potassium and reduces its absorption by the body. Relypsa received FDA approval for Veltassa in 2015. The company went public in 2013. Swiss firm Galenica acquired Relypsa for $1.5 billion in mid-2016.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Relypsa Announces European Approval of Veltassa® to Treat Adult Patients with Hyperkalemia (Elevated Blood Potassium Levels)




















July 21, 2017 08:00 ET

 | Source: Relypsa, Inc.






Today’s European Commission approval is the second worldwide; in the U.S., more than 33,000 patients have been treated with Veltassa since it was approved by the FDA in 2015Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or heart failure are especially susceptible to hyperkalemia, which, if untreated, can lead to abnormal heart rhythms and even sudden deathThe first launches of Veltassa in Europe are anticipated by year-end 2017 or early 2018  REDWOOD CITY, Calif., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Relypsa, Inc., a Vifor Pharma Group company, today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Veltassa® (patiromer) for the treatment of hyperkalemia, or elevated blood potassium levels. Veltassa, which is the brand name for patiromer in both the U.S. and Europe, is approved for marketing in all 28 EU countries and in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Vifor Pharma Group plans to launch Veltassa in Europe by the end of 2017 or in early 2018. “The European approval of Veltassa marks the first regulatory approval for this important medicine outside the U.S., further validating our innovative polymer science,” said Scott Garland, president of Relypsa. “In the U.S., we are encouraged by the growing acceptance and uptake of Veltassa by clinicians and patients. In the 18 months since we launched Veltassa, more than 33,000 patients with hyperkalemia, a serious and often chronic health concern, have been treated with it. We look forward to working with our colleagues at Vifor Pharma Group to help bring Veltassa to patients in Europe, where a new daily treatment for hyperkalemia is needed.” In the EU, Veltassa is indicated for the treatment of adults with hyperkalemia, and the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) notes that this includes those who develop hyperkalemia while being treated with renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor therapy. Nearly all patients treated with Veltassa in the clinical development program were on RAAS inhibitors at baseline. In the United States, Veltassa was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hyperkalemia in October 2015, becoming the first new medicine for this condition in more than 50 years. Marketing authorization applications for Veltassa have been submitted and are under review in Switzerland and Australia. Vifor Pharma plans to submit applications in other markets worldwide. Patients with advanced CKD and/or heart failure are especially susceptible to hyperkalemia, including the 3 million people in the United States who have stage 3 or 4 CKD and/or heart failure. Hyperkalemia can cause abnormal heart rhythms and even sudden death. There are often no warning signs, meaning a person can unknowingly experience spikes in potassium levels recurrently and be at risk for these cardiac events. Some medicines that are often prescribed to people with CKD and heart failure to help delay progression of their underlying disease can cause hyperkalemia as a side effect. These include RAAS inhibitors such as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), aldosterone antagonists (AAs), angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (MRA). About VeltassaVeltassa is a sodium-free potassium binder approved for the treatment of hyperkalemia. Veltassa should not be used as an emergency treatment for life-threatening hyperkalemia because of its delayed onset of action. Made in powder form consisting of smooth, spherical beads, Veltassa is mixed with water (one-third of a cup) and taken once-a-day with food. Veltassa is not absorbed and acts within the gastrointestinal tract. It binds to potassium in exchange for calcium, primarily in the colon. The potassium is then excreted from the body through the normal excretion process. Important Safety Information ContraindicationsVeltassa is contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to Veltassa or any of its components. Worsening of Gastrointestinal Motility  Use of Veltassa should be avoided in patients with severe constipation, bowel obstruction or impaction, including abnormal post-operative bowel motility disorders, because Veltassa may be ineffective and may worsen gastrointestinal conditions. Patients with a history of bowel obstruction or major gastrointestinal surgery, severe gastrointestinal disorders, or swallowing disorders were not included in clinical studies. HypomagnesemiaVeltassa binds to magnesium in the colon, which can lead to hypomagnesemia. In clinical studies, hypomagnesemia was reported as an adverse reaction in 5.3 percent of patients treated with Veltassa. Approximately 9 percent of patients in clinical trials developed hypomagnesemia with a serum magnesium value <1.4 mg/dL. Doctors should monitor serum magnesium and consider magnesium supplementation in patients who develop low serum magnesium levels. Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2 percent) are constipation, hypomagnesemia, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort and flatulence. Mild to moderate hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 0.3 percent of patients treated with Veltassa and included edema of the lips.

Relypsa, Inc. Revenue and Financial Data

   Relypsa knows that too much of a good thing can be bad for your health. A pharmaceutical company, Relypsa has developed a drug to treat hyperkalemia, a potentially life-threatening condition defined by high levels of potassium in the blood caused by kidney dysfunction. The company's first commercialized medicine, Veltassa (patiromer), is an orally administered, non-absorbed drug that binds to ingested potassium and reduces its absorption by the body. Relypsa received FDA approval for Veltassa in 2015. The company went public in 2013. Swiss firm Galenica acquired Relypsa for $1.5 billion in mid-2016.
