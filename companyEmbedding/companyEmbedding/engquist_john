This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year.

John Engquist
Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to H&E Equipment Services first quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call with me today are Leslie Magee, our Chief Financial Officer; Brad Barber, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Inda, our Vice President of Investor Relations.
I'll direct my comments this morning to our first quarter results, our business and overall market conditions. Then Leslie will review our financial results for the quarter. When Leslie finishes, I will close with a few brief comments. After which, we would take your questions.
Proceed to slide six, please. The first quarter was in line with our expectations and the current trends continue to reinforce our outlook for the year. Demand for rental equipment was solid, which resulted in mid single-digit rental revenue growth and margin holding firmly on the year-over-year basis.
While our rental business continues to benefit from increased activity in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin, as well as other oil field areas, we still believe sustained oil prices around $60 a barrel would increase demand for new cranes.
Total revenues decreased 8.2% or $20.2 million to 226.8 million. The decline was primarily related to new equipment sales, which declined 40.1% to 34.3 million. Given the shift in revenue mix, gross margins were strong up more than 130 basis points from a year ago to 34.2%. EBITDA was 68.8 million, compared to 69.1 million a year ago with margins increased to 30.3% compared to 28%.

Slide seven please. For the first quarter, we generated net income of $5.4 million or $0.15 per diluted share compared to $5.6 million or $0.16 per diluted share a year ago. Demand has been solid with physical utilization at 68.5% for the quarter versus 66.3% a year ago on the OEC basis. Our rental business performed well with revenues increasing 4.4% to $107.3 million, margins were 44.8%, while rental rates were down only 0.5% from a year ago. Dollar returns were 32.4%.
Proceed to slide eight please. This slide illustrates our nationwide footprint various regions, 78 branch locations and the 15 Greenfield sites that we have opened since the beginning of 2013. We expect to open three more branch locations in 2017, and remain focused on executing our Greenfield strategy to expand our footprint and grow our business.
We believe the environment in our Gulf Coast region remains positive as a result of several factors, Texas, our largest market continues to experience a very healthy economy is driving array of non-residential projects. The energy markets are also improving as a result of increased shale drilling activity. In both Taxes and Louisiana a solid line of large industrial projects are either underway, at breaking ground stage or scheduled to commence construction over the next few years. Just recently, they have also been several large industrial projects announced.
In February, for most plastics group began to seek permits from the State of Louisiana to invest $9.4 billion to build petrochemical plants in the state. In March, ExxonMobil announced plans to spend $20 billion on refineries, petrochemical plants and other projects in and around the Gulf Coast region including certain previously announced project. And in early April, China based Wan Hue [ph] chemical announced the company will develop a $1.1 million chemical manufacturing complex in Louisiana.
Proceed to slide nine, please. Activity in oil patch continued to accelerate during the first quarter driven primarily by the shale drillers in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins. At the end of the first quarter, 824 rigs were operating in the U.S. up 25% from 658 rigs at the end of the fourth quarter.
To put this is even better perspective, of the 824 total rigs operating domestically on March 31st, 543 or 66% of these rigs were drilling in our operating region. Our oil patch exposure at the end of the first quarter was roughly 5% of our total revenue, down from a high 13% at peak all prices.
Utilization in our four Texas branches with heavy exposure to the oil patch averaged 72.1% during the first quarter on a combined basis, up 40 basis points from the fourth quarter.
Our rental business is the near-term beneficiary of the improved energy markets, as I mentioned earlier, we believe $60 oil increased demand for new cranes sales in the oil patch.
 Proceed to slide 10, please. The key take away from this slide is the outlook for the non-residential construction market in general is positive for 2017 and beyond. Major market indicators including the Dodge Momentum Index and the ABI forecast continued growth. Construction employment reaching eight year high in March. And then, there is the infrastructure spending wildcard proposed by the new administration, in addition to significant other potential pro-business initiatives which could help extend the cycle for years to come.
At this time, I'm going to turn the call over to Leslie for the financial results.
Leslie Magee
Good morning, everyone, and thank you, John. I'll begin on slide 12 to discuss our financials in greater detail. As John discussed, our rental business trends were positive. However, the weakness in new equipment sales persisted as we cautioned our listeners on our last call.

To summarize, total revenues decreased 8.2%, $20.2 million in the first quarter compared to the same period a year ago, to $226.8 million with the strength in our rental business with the weakness in areas of our distribution business.
Gross profit decreased 4.3% or $3.5 million to $77.7 million compared to a year ago on higher margins of 34.2% compared to 32.9% a year ago. As for the rental segment, rental revenues increased 4.4% to $107.3 million physical utilization remained healthy with average time utilization, based on OEC, of 68.5% for the quarter compared to 66.3% a year ago. Demand increased in all product lines compared to a year ago.
As we anticipate new equipment sales declined, 40.1% or $22.9 million to $34.3 million new cranes sales decrease 73.5% representing $17.3 million of the total $22.9 million declined from a year ago. Used equipment sales increased 4.7% or $1.3 million to $28.9 million, largely as a result of higher used cranes and moving equipment sales, partially offset by a decline in June AWP equipment sales.
Sales from our rental fleet comprised of 86% of total used equipment sales this quarter compared to 88% a year ago. Our parts and service segments delivered $40.4 million in revenue on a combined basis down 8.7% from a year ago.
Total gross profit for the quarter was $77.7 million compared to $81.1 million a year ago, a decrease of 4.3% on 8.2% decrease in revenue. Consolidated margins were 34.2% compared to 32.1% a year ago.
For more detail by segment, rental gross margins for the quarter was 44.8% compared to 45.3% last year, with a slight decrease due to higher maintenance and repair cost in depreciation expense. We encourage slightly higher maintenance and repair cost compared to a year ago period, largely as a result of the increase activity in our oil fleet market.
Margins on new equipment sales were 11.4% for the first quarter, compared to 11.7% a year ago, largely due to lower margins on new crane and earthmoving sales. Used equipment sales gross margins were 31.2%, compared to 32.9% last year. Margins on pure rental fleet only sales were 34.7% compared to 36.70% a year ago.
Parts and service gross margin on a combined basis were 42.6%, compared to 42.3% a year ago.
Move to slide 13, please. Income from operations for the first quarter decreased 4.9% to $21.3 million compared to $22.4 million last year on a margin of 9.4% compared to 9.1% in the first quarter last year. The decrease in income from operations is primarily due to lower revenues compared to year ago.
Proceed to Slide 14. Net income was $5.4 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the first quarter compared to $5.6 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the same period a year ago. Our effective tax rate was 36.8% compared to 41% a year ago.
Please, move this Slide 15. EBITDA was $68.8 million in the first quarter compared to $69.1 million a year ago, and EBITDA margins were 30.3% compared to 28% a year ago.
Next, on Slide 16. SG&A was $57.3 million, a $2.1 million or 3.5% decrease over the same period last year. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 25.3% this quarter compared to 24% a year ago. Branch expansion cost increased $0.5 million compared to a year ago.
Next, on Slide 17. Our gross fleet capital expenditures during the first quarter were $40.8 million including non-cash transfers from inventory. Net rental fleet capital expenditures for the quarter were $16 million. Gross PP&E CapEx for the quarter was $5.8 million and net was $4 million.
Our average, average fleet age as of March 31, was 34.1 months. And we generated $17.5 million of cash in the first quarter compared to $21.2 million a year ago. We've included a free cash flow GAAP reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities in the appendix at the end of the presentation reconciling free cash flow for the same period is presented here on the slide.

Next on Slide 18, at the end of the first quarter, the size of our rental fleet based on OEC was $1.3 billion, a 4.6% or $58 million increase from a year ago. Average dollar utilization was 32.4% compared to 32.2% a year ago.
Proceed to Slide 19, please. At the end of the first quarter, our outstanding balance under our $602.5 million ABL facility was $152.4 million and therefore, we had $442.4 million of availability at quarter end, which is net of $7.7 million of outstanding letters of credit.
At this time, I would turn the call back over to John for conclusion.
John Engquist
Thank you, Leslie. I think I've addressed all of these points in my previous comments. But to conclude, I want to say that we believe the current trends in our business and industry are very encouraging as we move further into 2017.
Lastly, we paid our 11th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on March 10. At this time, we would like to take your questions. Operator, please provide instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Neil Frohnapple from Longbow Research.
Neil Frohnapple
Regarding new equipment sales, obviously, we weakness in current demand continues, but was there something from a timing standpoint such as a few cranes shipped right after the quarter-end, which caused the step down in revenue from kind of where you guys have been trending in the last few quarters?
John Engquist
I think we did have a few machine slip, I don't know how much that move the needle, but Brad you may…
Bradley Barber
Neil, we did. I mean we had a handful of cranes looked in. I don't think we want to get into habit of talking about delivery timing and schedules and slippage. Some of our German products was not delivered in time. It still would've been a very difficult quarter, but we certainly had cranes ship that did not make point of delivery dates and it would've helped some but still it would have been a tough comp.
Neil Frohnapple
Okay. But generally you would still expect new equipment sales to sort of bounce back from Q1 levels just directionally and I understand we're still waiting on $60 oil. So really how big the crane size, but again just trying to calibrate expectations for the rest of the year, I understand the business can be very lumpy but anymore color you can provide there will be great.
Bradley Barber
Look, the first quarter is always our softness quarter from the sales perspective and from rental perspective, utilization or rate or anything else. So yes, we would expect things to improve on the sales side as we move through the year. And I can tell you we are quoting a lot more stuff right now and we are encouraged by that. That had turned into purchase orders, but we do see more code activity and yes, you can expect sales to improve as they almost always do as we move into the year.
Neil Frohnapple
Okay, great. That’s helpful. I’ll jump back in queue.
John Engquist
Thank you.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group.
Nick Coppola
Hey, good morning.
Bradley Barber
Good morning, Nick.
Nick Coppola
So strong performance in terms of utilization improvement a larger fleet, so I just wanted to talk about the rate environment and what would it take to see an improvement in rates on the year-over-year basis? To what scale is seasonality and what do you think kind of the rate trajectory looks like from here?
John Engquist
Look as I just stated, the first quarter is always a tough quarter. It's your low point in utilization, you have a lot of fleet sitting and it's a tough environment to drive rates and it's not just us, it's everybody in the sector. So we are pretty comfortable only being down 0.5 point, particularly when to look at the numbers of big projects that we participate in. That's a pretty tough rate environment.

Our view is still that as we move into the year, rates will return positive and we would still hopeful that we will be positive by year-end on a year-over-year basis. We're really need to see the big rental players start being more rational in the big projects. I can tell you the rate environment there is really difficult and I think it’s really hurting rates in the entire sector.
Nick Coppola
Okay. And then, I just wanted to ask you – just maybe elaborate on demand trends in the oil patch. You certainly mentioned some positive comments about trends there, moving fleet back into the yield per Permian or are you continuing to move fleet there? I mean, I guess, what is the direction look like there?
John Engquist
Yes. We have continue to move fleet demand is strong, our utilization running at very high level from the mid-70s to 80% in our heavy oil field markets, Midland would be a good example. We see that environment very steady and improving so we have continue to move fleet in there, but I'll say we are doing so cautiously. We are being very careful not to over fleet those markets.
Nick Coppola
Yeah. That really makes lot of sense. Thanks for answering my questions.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.
Seth Weber
Hey, good morning everybody.
John Engquist
Good morning, Seth.
Seth Weber
A few questions here just sticking on the energy patch discussion. We have heard elsewhere that, that projects that are coming back on in the energy patch or coming back at lower rate versus prior, where we were at the peak is that, is that accurate or are you guys are seeing that as well? I guess is the first question.
John Engquist
You are talking about oil field upstream stuff?
Seth Weber
Yes John, thanks.
John Engquist
I am going to refer Brad on that question. The question is are we getting lower rates than we were on this equipment as going back in the oil patch?
Bradley Barber
The answer is no. We are not. I think John spoke to we're moving back in cautiously. Rates are very important to us and the best rates that we generally have on of equipment types are in the oilfield and that will continue to be our position. We are not going to forgo rates in add fleet to the oilfield. So the answer would be no, we have got quality rates that are improving in the oilfield.
Seth Weber
Okay, thanks. So just to clarify, it was relative to where it was at the peak not relative to the rest?
Bradley Barber
I guess, I'll have to Seth take a -- do a quick analysis. I suspect our rates are very similar today to where they were at the peak, but you know I would have to do an analysis to give you the definitive answer. But I strongly suspect there are very similar today to where they were at the peak.
Seth Weber
Okay, thanks. And just switching it up little bit, the parts and services business continues to be kind of frustrating here. I mean cranes have been software while, but then a new slide deck you referenced this in potential for near-term benefits on the parts and service business. And we have seen some pick up and that aftermarket pickup from some of the other OEMs and whatnot. Do you think the parts and service sales turned positive here, over the next -- I mean can may be positive for the year? How are you -- I guess, may be what's behind the comment on slide?
John Engquist
Look, we are seeing some parts and service opportunities come from the oil patch and obviously, from our earthmoving account. But crane rebuild, crane remanufacturing is a huge driver of our parts and service business and that is just really down right now. We are just not getting any activity in that area and that's really hurting us on the parts and service side. So the weakness you are seeing is almost totally related to the weakness in the crane market. And when that starts to rebound, and it will, it's a question of time, you'll see our parts and service business rebound with it.

Seth Weber
Okay. So you see you think it's kind of flattish this year then? Is that – is that the way you think about it?
John Engquist
Seth, yes. Flatfish would be probably a good way to think about it. And the only additional color I would add would be that, an increase and parts and service, particularly around cranes needs a substantial piece will be the indicator that sales would quickly follow.
Seth Weber
Sure. All right. That makes sense. Thanks. And then maybe just for Leslie, a quick one, it's tax rate now structurally lower or do you think it goes back to that kind of low 40% range?
Leslie Magee
No, for this year I would say that it is structurally lower. So the 37% is a good range for the remaining quarter with the exception of the third quarter we are estimating a discrete item which would substantially over the tax rate end of third quarter. This is something like around 11%. So for the year, we would be 28% to 29% on our effective tax rate. Once we take into account the discrete item in the third quarter.
Seth Weber
Right. Okay.
Leslie Magee
It’s a little unusual.
Seth Weber
Okay. And then sort of going forward, it should be in the high 30s then? Is it for when you think about it?
Leslie Magee
So beyond 2017?
Seth Weber
Yes. Yes.
Leslie Magee
It’s a little early to say. I would say at least 37% going forward, but again it is a little early to commit to that.
Seth Weber
Okay. All right. Thank you very much everybody.
John Engquist
Thanks.
Operator
We will take our next question from Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box
Yes. Hey, guys.
John Engquist
Hi, Joe.
Joe Box
Question for you on the dollar utilization, can you guys give up little bit more color on 100 basis point jump in your dirt equipment and the 200 basis – 220 basis point jump in the Telehandler relative to AWP that was flat year-over-year? I guess is that just a function of maybe buying more aerial equipment and the new equipment dragging down dollar utilization? Are you seeing any differences in either time out or rental rates for those different buckets?
John Engquist
Well, if I understand. I think the increase as we saw in dollar out or relative to the increase in physical utilization primarily. I am not – look, there are puts and takes within the product as you said.
We lump Telehandlers into the aerial work platform group and we're not going to comment on product types within, but there are always puts and takes. The broader issue was increase physical time utilization.
Joe Box
So, I mean, is there anything to read into that if the dirt site has higher dollar utilization and if it's coming from time is that a function of some projects ramping up? Is that pads are being created on the oil patch side? Anything to read into that?
John Engquist
I think, looked historically, earthmoving is been among our higher dollar utilization. So it's a product that some companies are challenged to manage from a maintenance standpoint, we do a pretty nice job. We continue to grow our earthmoving component of our business over the last few years, in fact, earthmoving has been taking a larger percent.
I mean, its growing a little quicker than most of the other products within the broader mix. We’ve also had some decline when you think about a little bit of a shift toward a benefit value utilization we had a decline with cranes. Cranes carry our lowest dollar utilization historically; even when they are better or more difficult they carried the lowest dollar utilization. So we have got some slight declines there. We basically reinvest those dollars in higher returning product.
Joe Box
Maybe switching gears then, incremental rental gross profit margins came in at about 33%, looks like it's below the more typical 50% plus range. Can you maybe put some color around that margin and may be just a sense for where it could shake out as we move to the year?

John Engquist
Sure. I would say that for the first quarter, even it’s below what you would prefer to it’s kind of norm of 60%, it is going to be due to a higher maintenance and repair cost the that I refer too. So throughout the course of the year, we would expect that to normalize along with some of the other positive drivers. John talked about rate a little bit, physical utilization and then the fleet growth. So I think those were all balanced out to get a more normalized rental incremental margin.
Joe Box
Got it. Thanks, Leslie. And maybe just to take a different angle on your distribution business, I guess specifically around new sales, we are starting to see some signs of life out of the OEMs, do you expect similar benefits to eventually kind of filter into the new equipment sales or do you think you are too crane heavy to see that type of benefit, any sort of change maybe in the relationships with your customers? Just any sort of color around the relationship and how we should think about that uptick in OEMs relative to what you guys could see?
John Engquist
When you speak to uptick in OEMs, are you speaking of earthmoving manufacturers?
Joe Box
More on the earth side than the crane, I guess to be specific?
John Engquist
Yes. Look we feel good about our earthmoving end market. The demand is solid. We have got a lot of activity there. The area continues to be very weak and challenging for us is on the cranes side. This demand is about as weak as I've seen it. With that said, we are quoting a lot more equipment and I mean a lot more equipment than we have been. That is not translated in the purchase orders as of yet, but we’re cautiously optimistic that we're going to start seeing some pickup in demand there. But on the earthmoving side, we are very pleased with what we’re seeing. I mean there is solid activity and is just really strong demand in the non-residential construction market and that demand is very broad-based, so we feel good about our end markets.
John Engquist
Joe, the other thing I would add, I know you're talking about distribution, but as a leading indicator our largest increase as we sit here today year-over-year has been in earthmoving utilization. It's up about 530 basis points year-over-year. So that's a good indicator of what we think will continue to accomplish on the distribution side as well.
Now keeping context, we are commodity dealer. That's the broadest piece of our earthmoving distribution. We’re also a distributor, but we are a commodity dealer in two states. So in the broader mix of distribution revenues, cranes is heavily weighted to cranes and I think you’re aware of that.
Joe Box
Got it. That’s good color. Thank you, guys.
John Engquist
You bet.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank.
Sean Wondrack
Hi, John and Leslie. How are you?
John Engquist
Good. How are you?
Sean Wondrack
Very good. So just going back to the oil and gas basins again, I know we talked about this a little bit last quarter but just wanted to see if you can give us update, how have you seen the competitive environment down there in terms of operators who are still servicing and operators, who are basically gone insolvent and basically out of the industry now. Especially at this point in time, what you are seeing out there?
John Engquist
You know from a competitive environment standpoint, just relative to the oil patch, I think we're probably seeing pretty good discipline. I think people are being fairly cautious. You know these oil prices bounce around a little bit. I mean, they have been staying in the 50s but I think everybody is cautiously optimistic and being fairly disciplined from a competitive standpoint. We are seeing the crazy competition, crazy rate pressures on a big petrochemical projects, the more downstream stuff, the rate environment there is brutal right now.

Sean Wondrack
And when you basically approach something like that, when you know they are basically fighting for the lowest rates, what's your take on that? How do you respond to that situation? Do you share that revenue, or do you continue to compete for it?
John Engquist
We do some of both. I mean we get to a point where we walk away from the deal based on rate. We do participate on those projects. And they are not the biggest driver of our business, but we own a lot of those big projects and obviously, we have to. It impacts our overall rate performance. But, you know, we do on a regular basis walk away from deals because of rates on those big projects.
Sean Wondrack
Right. Thank you for that. And then just a quick remainder, what is your cash tax position currently? Do you still have NOLs, or do you expect that to continue for the future?
John Engquist
We're still in the NOL position, so really not a significant cash taxpayer at all.
Sean Wondrack
And do you think that'll continue into 2018 or will you mostly exhausted them in 2017?
John Engquist
They will run into 2018, yes.
Sean Wondrack
Okay, great. And then just lastly, you know, as I look at Bloomberg right now, your bonds are trading at roughly 3%. They're obviously callable in September. You know you have some rate hikes going on this year. Are you considering refinancing these bonds?
John Engquist
We're always looking are our options as it relates to our bonds. So that's just an ongoing situation for us. And you know we'll watch that and you know watch what rates are doing and we'll make that decision at the appropriate time and with that's something I think we certainly stay on top of.
Sean Wondrack
Great. Thank you answering my questions.
John Engquist
Sure.
Operator
We will take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS.
Steven Fisher
Thanks. Good morning. Wondering if you guys…
John Engquist
Good morning.
Steven Fisher
Morning. What if you could about your experience at CONEXPO related to cranes. Clearly, there was a lot of optimism at the show. In general, it still seems like things are a little soft in the crane market, were you guys placing orders, taking orders or just maybe if you could talk about your experience at CONEXPO
Bradley Barber
Sure. Steve, so the experience was good, it was very positive. We just placed orders, we did take some orders. The order intake was not as robust the kind of Expo was a few years ago, but it was certainly a positive event and we had an outstanding turnout of our largest most loyal customers. So good event, positive things happen because of the event. That being said, we are still overshadowed by the broader issue and that's cheap oil and weak energy markets.
Steven Fisher
Was there a -- that was helpful. Was there sort of a waiting towards where the orders, what kind of products you are taking orders on?
Bradley Barber
It's a mix of products. There was no particular product type that stands out. That's worth noting.
Steven Fisher
Okay. Just looking at the dollar utilization on cranes coming down, I'm not sure Brad if you mention what driving that decline in utilization? Was that the Gulf Coast in particular?
Bradley Barber
It's broad-based and the drivers lower physical utilization and substantially lower rental rates. Our largest the decreases have come in the cranes segments as you may can imagine.
Steven Fisher
I mean so no particular geography. That's features. And just Leslie to clarify your expectation on rental gross margin, do you expect that to be flat for the rest of the year or up on a year-over-year basis?
Leslie Magee
Yeah. We would expect it to be up on a year-over-year basis.
Steven Fisher
Okay. And then just lastly. What the utilization of the Texas branches that you open in the later part of last year, either on a Q1 basis or a kind of a current run rate, just curious how quickly those branches have ramped up utilization?

John Engquist
Yeah. We don't quote utilization at the per branch level, but I will say that the utilization of those locations is very similar to the utilization of the locations within the region.
Steven Fisher
Okay. Terrific. Thanks a lot.
John Engquist
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank.
Sean Wondrack
Hey. Just one follow-up here. On slide nine, you list your end markets and clearly your industrial non-res and res, but then you also have 24% for this other category. Is there any way you could break that down a little more for us? Like what does that represent exactly? Are there any bigger buckets in that? Does that have any oil and gas in it?
John Engquist
No. Sean, it's more of a catch off for things that are not squarely in one of the other buckets and we typically don't break it out in further detail, but it's running pretty consistently.
Sean Wondrack
Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you.
John Engquist
Thank you.
Operator
That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. John Engquist for closing comments and remarks.
I want to thank everybody for participating today. Obviously, we feel very good about our end markets. We think we got some runway in front of us, and I think we're going to have a nice year and hopefully a nice a several years in front of us. So thanks for participating, look forward to talking to you on the next call.
Operator
This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

Good afternoon and welcome to the H&E Equipment Services Acquisition of Neff Corporation Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Inda, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Inda
Thank you, Ashley, and welcome to H&E Equipment Services conference call to discuss the Company's entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Neff Corporation which we announced on Friday, July 14th. The format for today's call includes the slide presentation which is posted on our website at www.he-equipment.com.
Please proceed to Slide 2. Conducting the call today will be John Engquist, Chief Executive Officer; Brad Barber, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Leslie Magee, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary.
Please proceed to Slide 3. During today’s call, we’ll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. We’ve reconciled these measures to GAAP figures in our presentation, which is available on our website.
Before we start, let me offer the cautionary note that this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements about our beliefs, and expectations and statements containing words such as may, could, believe, expect, anticipate, and similar expressions constitute forward-looking statements, including statements related to our pending merger with Neff Corporation. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.
The summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the Company's slide presentation for today's call. And also includes the risks described in the risk factors in the Company’s and Neff's most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Investors, potential investors and other listeners are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this conference call.
With that stated, I’ll now turn the call over to John Engquist.
John Engquist
Thank you, Kevin. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you being with us today to discuss our agreement of acquire Neff Corporation which we announced last fall. On the call with me today are Leslie Magee, our CFO; Brad Barber, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Inda, our Vice President of Investor Relations.
I'll direct my comments this afternoon to the transaction highlights and our strategic rationale for acquiring Neff. Brad will provide an overview of the combined company and expected synergy. Then Leslie will review the proposed transaction financing and anticipated financial impacts to our business. When Leslie finishes, I will close with a few brief comments, and then we'll be happy to take your questions.
Proceed to Slide 6 please. As a public company, Neff is probably well known to many of you on this call. Neff is a proven operator with an excellent management team and a track record of delivering solid financial and operational results. The acquisition of Neff provides an opportunity to accelerate our stated strategy to expand our footprint across the United States, as we seek to penetrate and grow our business in strategic segment.

Further, this transaction will bring together, what we believe to be two highly complementary businesses that share a commitment to addressing the increasingly complex equipment needs of our customers. Our broader geographic footprint and enhanced capabilities and strategic markets coupled with complementary expertise across equipment categories are expected to help us achieve our growth goal.
In terms of transaction highlights, the initial purchase price is $21.07 per share for a total enterprise value of 1.2 billion, including approximately $690 million of net debt. The per share merger consideration payable to Neff stockholders is subject to certain downward adjustments, not to exceed $0.44 per share in the event that H&E incurs certain increased financing cost due to the transaction not being consummated on or prior to January 14, 2018.
The Board of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction. This deal represents the 6.2 times multiple based on Neff's last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, as of March 31, 2017. Estimated spent cost synergies lower the multiple to 5.4 times, which then goes down the 4.7 times including estimated tax attributes acquired in the transaction. We anticipate 25 million to 30 million in annual cost synergies by the end of 2019.
We also expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to EBITDA, then accretive to adjusted EPS and for a cash flow margin beginning in 2018. We expect to finance the transaction with a balance mix of borrowings on a new ABL credit facility, long-term debt and newly issued public equity. The structure allows us to keep our leverage manageable that we expect debt to adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 3 times by the end of 2018.
The acquisition is expected to generate in excess of $800 million of growth tax assets for H&E, arriving from a step-up and basis of certain of Neff's asset. Wells Fargo Bank and affiliated entities have agreed to provide committed financing for the transaction subject to customary conditions. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition.
Private investment funds managed Wayzata Investment Partners LLC holding approximately 62.7% of the outstanding common shares of Neff have executed a written consent to approve the transaction, thereby providing the required stockholder approval for the transaction. The merger agreement includes a go-shop period which runs through August 20, 2017, during which the special committee of Neff’s Board of Directors, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, may solicit our alternative proposals to acquire Neff.
There is a possibility that this process will result in Neff's receipt of a superior offer or that Neff will approve our consummate an alternative transaction in lieu of our proposed transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions including Hart-Scott-Rodino Act clearance.
Proceed to Slide 7 please. The Neff acquisition is the major milestone for the future of H&E and from absolutely every perspective we believe that it was a right deal at the right time. The combined companies would be one of the largest equipment rental companies in the United States, generating nearly 1.4 billion in annual revenue on a LTM basis ending March 31, 2017, with a fleet consisting of more than 43,000 units at 2.2 billion of equipment based on original equipment cost as of the same date.
The transaction will increase our rental fleets exposure to the earthmoving asset class, which is a relatively underpenetrated product line compared to the aerial work platform equipment. The deal will increase the density of our existing footprint in the strategically important and high growth Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and West Coast region. The deal will also increase H&E's penetration in the non-residential construction market and expand its exposure to new regional and local customers in overall construction markets.

With the addition of Neff's earthmoving assets, we believe we'll be well positioned to benefit from new infrastructure projects and governmental spending initiatives. Lastly, but very importantly, H&E and Neff are culturally similar in many respects which is extremely important in any deal especially one of this scale. Not only are both companies similarly structured and operated, both employee bases are very focused on the highest standard of work and customer satisfaction, safety and entrepreneurial spirit.
At this time, I'll let Brad provide an overview of the combined companies.
Brad Barber
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you John. Please proceed to Slide 9. We believe the Neff acquisition is a transformative step for H&E. John, Leslie and myself and our entire management team and employees are extremely energized to get the transition behind us and integrate Neff into our operations. We believe the combination of H&E and Neff will result in extremely formidable equipment rental and integrated equipment services company.
This slide affixes several key metrics for H&E, Neff and how H&E is expected to look post closing. The Neff acquisition will significantly increase our scale. On a combined basis for the last 12 months ending March 31, 2017, the Company has generated nearly 1.4 billion in total revenue, 814 million in rental revenue, and 494 million in adjusted EBITDA. Our branch count renewed and our employee base will increase by more than 1,000 individuals.
Let me provide a few comments about fleet, which was a significant strategic checkbox with this deal. As of March 31, 2017, the Company's combined fleet totaled 2.2 billion based on OEC and consisted of more than 43,000 pieces of machinery. The combined company will possess one of the largest earthmoving rental fleets in the industry. As of March 31, 2017, the combined company's earthmoving fleet totaled 727 million and consisted of more than 8,000 units with an average age for Neff's fleet at 49 months compared to 34.1 months for H&E. Average age for Neff's earthmoving fleet was 43 months compared to 24.4 months for H&E.
Our fleet mix will undergo a significant shift post closing. Using the March 31st fleet statistics for both companies, aerial work platforms will continue to represent the largest component of our fleet, but will decrease to 43% from 63%, and earthmoving would increase to 34% from 21%. In terms of Neff's rental revenues by end market as of March 31, 2017, 30% was infrastructure, 25% residential construction, 15% -- excuse me, 25% non-residential construction, 15% residential construction, 13% other, 10% municipal and 7% oil and gas.
Please proceed to Slide 10. This map depicts H&E's current 78 branches and Neff's current 69 branches. The map demonstrates why we believe Neff's existing footprint is an extremely strategic fit for H&E, increasing branch and customer coverage density in a higher growth Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and West Coast regions. Both H&E and Neff customers will benefit from best-in-class practices in a wide range of equipment in more locations.
Please proceed to Slide 11. We expect total cost synergies between 25 million and 30 million and believe this is a very achievable number in terms of total operating cost. Income statement synergies are anticipated to come from a combination of closing select overlapping branches, benefit from a new regional operating structure and reduction in corporate overhead. Total cost synergies would have been even higher, but were partially offset by differences in accounting policies primarily related to the treatment of depreciation expense.
Cash flow synergies are expected to be realized from fleet and rolling stock procurement savings through favorable equipment pricing, vendor consolidation and our ability to leverage large purchase volumes. In terms of timing, we anticipate the synergies to be fully realized by the end of 2019.

I will now turn the call over to Leslie to discuss the financial implications of the transaction. Leslie?
Leslie Magee
Thank you, Brad. Please just stay to Slide 13. The financial aspects of the Neff deal are very attractive and transformation as well, so let me quickly hit the highlight so we can move onto your question. We expect to finance the transaction with a balance mix of borrowings on a new ABL credit facility, long-term debt and equity as previously announced. We believe this is an appropriate mix for our capital structure, enabling us to continue investing in growth. The 1.2 billion purchase price including the 690 million net debt will be paid in cash.
We expect our current credit ratings will be maintained with the use of equity to partially fund the transaction, our increased operating scale and our commitment to de-lever. Based upon late third quarter closing, we anticipate leverage of approximately three times based on debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2018 and further reduce to approximately 2.5 times by the end of 2019. The transaction is non-contingent on financing, as John indicated H&E has a paying committed financing from Wells Fargo and supported this transaction subject to customary conditions.
Please proceed to Slide 14. In summary, in addition to the strategic rationale John and Brad discussed earlier, the Neff acquisition brings very attractive financial characteristic as well, beginning with an immediate 40 plus percent increase in revenue, combined with the run rate cost synergies of 25 million to 30 million, as Brad discussed. By 2018, we expect deal to be accretive to adjusted EPS. When you factor in cost synergies and approximately 150 million present value of estimated tax benefits that brings the adjusted purchased price multiples to 4.7 times, a very attractive rate of return for the acquisition.
Deal will also have a positive impact on margin, based on March 31, 2017, LTM revenue and EBITDA margins are combined margins with increase 600 basis points to 38% including run rate cost synergies. Before I turn the call to John for his conclusions, I want to remind everyone that we do not anticipate making any further comments regarding the transaction for our business generally until we report our second quarter earnings on July 27. John?
John Engquist
Thank you, Leslie. Please proceed to Slide 16. We're extremely excited about this transaction for the numerous reasons we outlined in our comments we say afternoon. Acquiring Neff is strategic and timely for our company, as we expect it to provide immediate financial benefits, scale and exposure to new end market and customers. We’re also pleased with the structure of the transaction which should allow us to maintain a flexible capital structure.
Everyone at H&E is egger to begin the integration process with the Neff team. We look forward to welcoming Neff's talented employee base to the H&E family to offer a more coverage and capabilities to support our combined customer base and to continuing our work to create value for our shareholders.
We will now take questions. Operator, please provide instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Nick Coppola with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning guys this is Steven on -- good afternoon. This is Steven on for Nick. A couple of questions. Now that you have combined two of the largest players in the industry and you are now about the fourth largest player in the gen rent industry. Can you talk about little more specifically your advantages of scale now how this benefits you at buying power, the ability to share fleet across the network, expand on that a little bit?

John Engquist
Yes, look, this definitely gives us better coverage. We have more locations. They are having earthmoving. We are having aerials. We see just a lot of benefits. It’s a high synergy deal. We are going to be able to take a lot of cost down of the deal and at the same time cover the markets better. Neff has a different customer base than we do. We are heavily weighted to the larger project, larger customers. Neff does a really good job with the smaller projects, smaller customers. This is a really, really good fit for us.
Unidentified Analyst
And turning on from that with the difference in the age of equipment for both companies with H&E's fleet being so much younger especially on the earthmoving side. What is the outlook for acquiring new equipment once the deal is closed?
John Engquist
Nothing out of the ordinary, we are going to continue our CapEx plan on both sides. Neff has a CapEx plan, we do. No significant changes. Obviously, we will be selling off the oldest part of their fleet and replacing some of that equipment, but we don’t see it creating any unusual CapEx requirements right now.
Unidentified Analyst
Excellent. And one last question, does -- having the new Neff's branch network provide any strategic platform for growing the equipment sales side of your business? Thank you.
John Engquist
No, it does not. I mean Neff is a pure rental play and it will stay such.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box
So just want to go back to that strategy question. When I think of your business, John, obviously you guys have a lot of large project work, but I tend to think about you guys as both being a bit regional maybe super regional. So when you want these two companies together, does it ultimately open up more national account business that maybe on a standalone basis both you and Neff for maybe too small to play in before?
John Engquist
I think there is some benefit there. I mean it gives us better coverage and probably a better fleet mix. So, I think it opens up some opportunities there. I think the real play here is these different customer bases that we have. I think there is going to be some real cross-selling opportunities there that are going to be very important to this business.
Joe Box
I apologize, if I missed it, but do you actually say the amount of overlap that you guys have on a customer basis?
Brad Barber
No, we have not, but it's -- we view this as very minimal. And let me go back to add on to John's comments, we've been successful. Neff's been successful particularly with strategic accounts, more regional type accounts. I think the better balance of fleet mix is going to be a nice advantage and that will allow us to grow those types of accounts more than we could have without the combination of the two companies.
Joe Box
So, and obviously your strategy up to this point has largely been in greenfield expansion. I don't know what happens to that strategy going forward. I assume it get puts on hold, but can you maybe just talk about how you plan to kind of match these two companies together? How you think about the benefits of having density in a given market with multiple locations? And what the overall benefit would be there versus maybe saying okay we've got three locations in Dallas, let's look to -- restructure that down to one or two locations and ultimately going to get a cost savings from that?
John Engquist
So, look as we've gone through our greenfield strategy, and Houston and Dallas are great examples where we've added multiples of locations over the last four or five years. We've realized cost savings on the transaction meaning less time, less cost to deliver to a job because we're physically closer. We've realized that just how underpenetrated some of our opportunities had been, and in every case when we've kind of added a second, third or fourth location in one of these markets, it's of been the proverbial one plus one is equal to three force.

And we view this as something similar. Now, overtime, we're going to focus on integrating the businesses, performing at high quality levels and as you stated we're likely to pause our greenfield strategy for a period of time during the integration. But we see opportunities for both of these two combined to continue to grow similarly in some of these large markets and in many cases one large location in a major metropolitan area, you're significantly disadvantaged due to the logistics associated with that.
Brad Barber
Yes, Joe, the consolidation we'll have on locations is where we've two locations that within half a mile or a mile apart. In a major market where these locations are spread out, that's a benefit, that's -- nothing will be trying to take cost out of that, that helps us better penetrate the market.
Joe Box
Understood. One last one from me and then I'll hop back in line. But, so what's the interest expense assumption that you guys are thinking about on the financing here? And how should we think about the dividend going forward, is that still part of the capital allocation?
John Engquist
Absolutely, the dividend will stay in place, and I think the cost of the financing remains to be seen in, and I assume you're talking about the note. But our anticipation is somewhere in the 6.25 range.
Joe Box
So, but there'll be a new ABL facility there too, right, I mean I don't know if there's any opportunity to reduce the interest expense there as well?
John Engquist
There'll be a new ABL facility, yes. This is going to be a mix of ABL and new notes and some equity.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Market.
Seth Weber
I wanted to ask about the systems that you're going to be using. So I don't know too much about Neff systems. But are they compatible with your current systems? And is there going to be some sort of blending of that, the internal operations? Or how should we think about this process of kind of getting everybody on the same page if that's what you're going to be doing?
John Engquist
Yes, Seth look, we've invested over the course of last seven or eight years of tremendous amount of money in systems to position our self to be able to run a much, much larger business, many times larger. So, we developed a platform that will support that. Neff will be integrated onto our platform and totality. So, they will be brought on our platform and that’s why we run the business.
Seth Weber
Okay, do you have sense for, I mean, there has been a lot of discussion around the industry lately around contract mix, day, week, month et cetera. Based on your comments about smaller customer, et cetera, I image there mix is more skewed towards daily or weekly rentals. But do you have data around that relative to what to your kind of set up right now?
John Engquist
Look, I believe there average renewal contract is by a little shorter than our average contract because of that mix, but I don’t have any data here in front of me that I can share with you on that.
Seth Weber
Okay. And I guess may be just for Leslie. I just want to make sure I am understanding this different accounting policies statement. Is that just a function of the useful life on the earthmoving equipment versus your current mix or -- I just want to make sure I'm understanding that.
Leslie Magee
It's different life across their fleet along with different salvage value.
Seth Weber
Okay, so they're assuming some sort of salvage value?
John Engquist
That’s correct. The net effect is that they depreciate their equipment little longer than we do.
Seth Weber
Their earthmoving equipment is depreciated longer than your earthmoving equipment or just, in general, fleet?
John Engquist
In general.
Seth Weber
But is the earthmoving equipment about on the same methodology?

John Engquist
Same thing, they depreciate their earthmoving fleet a little longer than we do.
Operator
We will take our next question from Steven Fisher from UBS.
Steven Fisher
Just to clarify on the deleveraging. What is the expectation of that deleveraging will come from cash flow, debt reduction -- cash flow based debt reduction or just to increase EBITDA or some combination?
John Engquist
Both.
Leslie Magee
Combination of both.
John Engquist
Yes.
Steven Fisher
Okay. And I guess as you consider the possible strategic action that you could have taken here. How did you weigh the decision to go into say a larger earthmoving heavy company versus may be a specialty company that they have had higher returns or a company not into your main geographic region?
John Engquist
Yes, look, we've looked at the concept of specialty businesses many, many times. You tend to pay a very high multiple for those businesses, and when you integrate I mean the Company like H&E that multiple seems to get homogenized then I think you lose it. We like what we're doing, we like the fleet mix combination here. We like the earthmoving business. We've been an earthmoving distributor for many, many, many years. We understand the earthmoving business. We know how to maintain that type fleet. We know how to deal with undercarriages.
It’s a business we like. It's one of our highest dollar return assets. It's the largest secondary markets of any product type we deal and so it's easy to adjust those fleets up and down. The secondary markets are huge. They are always liquid. It's an asset class that enjoys solid residual values. There is really nothing about the earthmoving business that we don’t like. And we were growing that aspect of our business before we got together when Neff on this transaction. This just accelerates that a lot. So, we are very happy with this acquisition and their fleet mix.
Steven Fisher
Okay. And then lastly, I know Leslie mentioned the EBITDA margins should go up. I think you said it was about 600 basis points. What does the increasing mix of earthmoving due to the overall returns on invested capital of the business?
Leslie Magee
We have to do further analysis and follow-up. I don’t have that exact analysis in front of me.
Brad Barber
Yes, but I would point to the comment John just made, that earthmoving generally carries the highest dollar utilization of all the product types that we carry. Such point nice GP and it's one of the easier fleets to manage whenever you need to readjust your mix of proposition. So maybe directly that can help you that it is among, if not the highest dollar utilization of the products family that offer.
Operator
We will take our next question from Scott Napier with Oppenheimer.
Scott Napier
First one for me. Could you please discuss rental penetration opportunity within earthmoving and in the broader portfolio in your consideration from that aspect on the acquisition?
John Engquist
Yes and that’s a great question. And it's one of the things we like about this acquisition. Earthmoving equipment is relatively under penetrated in the rental markets. If you look at the aerial business, it's almost all rentals -- nobody buy the areas anymore. It's almost totally rented. So, the penetration is in the 90% range. I think earthmoving penetration is around 50%. So, we think that gives us some real nice growth opportunities in front of us.
Scott Napier
I didn’t see in the presentation pack and maybe you are not prepared to provide at this juncture, but considerations of growth maintenance CapEx of the combined company and will there be any dramatic sales or increases the CapEx upon consummation of the deal? Thanks.
John Engquist
There will not be dramatic increases to CapEx, no.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank.

Sean Wondrack
Just a couple of more questions for you. First, I'd like to ask you, what was the rationale behind how the transaction rose? Did you guys approach Neff or did they approach you? Can you talk about that a little bit?
John Engquist
Well, look, over the course of last three or four years, we looked at lot of opportunities out there. And we've looked at about everything that's come to market. And we've never felt like we found the right fit whether it's multiple expectations, issues with fleet, cultural issues whatever. We haven't found the right fit. We feel like this is the right fit. We approached Neff through our financial advisor and we're able to get together on this and couldn't be more excited about it.
Sean Wondrack
And just given that there's been quite a few acquisitions in the market this year whether you have [indiscernible] and now you guys are acquiring Neff. Do you think there's a transition within the industry to be a little more acquisitive right now, given the potential for maybe a little bit of a longer cycle and some infrastructure programs out there?
John Engquist
Well, I think you've got a pretty fragmented sector here, there's a lot of small players, and so I wouldn't expect you to continue to see a certain amount of consolidation. It is our belief that this cycle has been extended. So, there's some activity. I don't have any real insights or what that's going to look like going forward, but I would expect to see more consolidation.
Sean Wondrack
And then I'm not sure, if you've given any specifics surrounding this lately. But the debt and equity split, what percentage of the deal do you expect to fund with debt versus equity? And have you publicly disclosed that or?
Leslie Magee
We previously released an 8-K and so, what we intend to do currently is a 1.25 billion in ABL, 575 million in senior unsecured notes, and up to 250 million in equity based on today's expectations.
Sean Wondrack
Right, that's great. And do you have any numbers of the Neff family joining your company? Any members of management are joining your Board?
John Engquist
Not at this time, no.
Sean Wondrack
And then very quick, last question, when you think about working capital with the inclusion of Neff. Do you think that there should be a big movement one way or another this year?
Leslie Magee
No, we'd not expect that.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America.
Ross Gilardi
I just had a question, wonder, if you could just flush out the go-shop theory a little bit more, any other color you could provide? And based on your understanding as Neff's been shopped already and why establish formality around that? What happens at the point that the go-shop theory expires to the point that the deal actually close? Does the breakup fee come into play or something or?
John Engquist
No, no. I mean I'm not sure I understand your question. I mean I think go-shop theory they're pretty common when you're acquiring a public company. It's basically protection for the Board, and they want to make sure they're getting the best price they can get for their shareholders, so nothing uncommon there.
Ross Gilardi
Is there a breakup fee with the deal right now?
John Engquist
No.
Ross Gilardi
And the extent that you can answer this, in the event there was a higher bid for Neff, how would you think about H&E from -- how should we think about H&E from credit prospective? Would you -- you’re overall wiliness to have a lower credit rating and just how would think about the capital structure in the event to this became more of a competitive option type process?
John Engquist
Well, I mean, I think there's a lot of speculation going on there and we will cross that bridge when we get there. I'm not sure what you meant by your comment on credit ratings. We don’t anticipate doing anything that's going lower our credit rating.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe Box
Just wondering, if you guys could put some more color around the tax step up, I think you said Leslie that the MPV is worth about a half turn toward the value of the deal, if I heard that right. Ultimately curious about, what the free cash flow profile is going to look like going forward? And how long this could erratically push out cash taxes?
Leslie Magee
Right, so, there is obviously significant NOLs evolved. And so, I believe they're going to run out four. We're estimating today into 2020 that's what we're looking at.
Joe Box
So that the NOLs and the tax step up that come from this deal. So you wouldn’t have cash taxes until 2020 with the deal, correct?
Leslie Magee
Right, no significant cash taxes to speak up, until 2020.
Joe Box
Okay, great. Remind me what was that before hand with just H&E?
Leslie Magee
The run-off of NOLs, the pure run-off -- I'm not sure I understand your question.
Brad Barber
Our cash payer next year, mid-year, next year.
Leslie Magee
And we ended 2016 with close to a 100 million in NOLs.
Joe Box
Got it. So then it does theoretically change the free cash flow profile, the combined company, it ultimately just pushes out your cash tax?
Leslie Magee
That's correct.
Joe Box
Okay. And then can you just let me talk about the cadence of synergies of frontloaded item or should we think about it being spread evenly through 2019?
John Engquist
Look, we think we will get half the synergies in 18 and then be fully synergized in 19.
Operator
And it appears that there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Engquist for any additional or closing remarks.
John Engquist
Well, I just want to thank everybody for being on the call. I hope you can tell how excited we're about this acquisition. It's transformational for us. It moves us strategically where we think we need to be to really create significant shareholder value and that’s what our job is. So, thank you for being on the call and we look forward to speaking with you shortly on our earnings call. Thank you.
Operator
And that concludes today's conference. We thank you all for your participation, and you may now disconnect.
