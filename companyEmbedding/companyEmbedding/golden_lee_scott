					Dark Days The Forge #1 sdcc 2017 variant, 
										$29.99							
VERY FINE/NEAR MINT(W) Scott Snyder, James TynionIV (A) Jim Lee & Various (CA) Jim Lee, Scott WilliamsDARKNESS COMES TO THE DC UNIVERSE WITH THE MYSTERY OF THE FORGE! Aquaman, The Flash and more of DC's pantheon of heroes suspect Batman of hiding a dark secret that could threaten the very existence of the multiverse! It's an epic that will span generations-but how does it connect to the origins of one of DC's most legendary heroes?  The great comics event of summer 2017 is about to begin courtesy of superstar writers Scott Snyder and James Tynion III and illustrated by a master class of comics artists: Andy Kubert, Jim Lee and John Romita Jr.! You do not want to miss this one!  RATED TDate Available: 06/14/2017
BONUS REVIEW by "Doc" Schaefer

I would have loved to have sat in on this book's planning session! Scott Snyder admits to have dropping easter eggs and clues for years with no one catching onto the Big Picture. All are main stay characters are here with cameos galore. As we start getting lead down a path of mystery and intrigue. Now, I will admit that I am a sucker for a mystery and Scott Snyder and James Tynion IV have definitely presented us with a buffet but I fear it maybe too much. On the one hand, I am glad to see us taking two more steps closer to the return of the DC Multiverse. Plastic Man, Mr. Terrific, Mr. Miracle! But what if this is just another Next Big Thing moment and by the time it's all over, I'll be left more confused than when I started? Well, for the time being, I will enjoy this little sneak peak and wait a little guarded at the future.    I give it 8 out of 10 Grahams

Description




Product: CassetteShipping from: 24.07.17Originally released: 08.12.08
For the first time ever, almost 10 years after initial release, Blah Records brings to you a physical analogue version of the first ever Lee Scott album; 'Put On The Glasses'. Considered a classic by Lee Scott fans the world over, it can now be owned on very limited edition cassette tape. Only 100 copies available.
Description:
(Written retrospectively by Lee Scott)"I made this album over a period of about 2 and a half years, it began late 2005/early 2006 and finished late 2008. The project was made using an old haggard computer with a cracked copy of windows 2000, various cracked music editing software my friend helped me hook up and a bunch of various pieces of equipment I owned, inherited somehow or borrowed including an old MPC with a few broken pads, a couple of keyboards, a shitty numark mixer held together with tape, a record player, several televisions hooked up to a chipped Sky box for samples and inspiration, a VHS player, a cassette player and a bunch of percussion instruments, cat's toys and childrens toys that made noises. The microphone was plugged directly into the computer somehow. I guess that's how they used to make them. The final version of the album was pieced together as one continuous track on a copy of Cool Edit 95 which would often crash in the middle of making some sort of important change. I'd say I made no less than 100 different versions of the album before eventually settling on what you hear here. I mixed and mastered it myself, but I feel like a tit for even using those words like I had a clue what I was doing. A friend of mine helped me to press it up onto CD, I made 250 copies. The front cover was taken in the living room I made the album in using a friends mobile phone. The album's title is inspired by the movie They Live."
