Barman charged with theft remanded in custodyA 30-year old barman has been remanded in custody after denying his role in the theft of an iPad, a computer and two suitcases belonging to a foreign resident.
French national Salah M’Raoui was arraigned today over charges of being part of an aggravated theft which took place on July 20. The man was further charged with permitting a Hyundai car to be driven without a valid insurance cover.
Defence lawyer Francine Abela, assisting the accused, filed a request for bail which, however, was strongly objected to by the prosecution on various grounds.
Inspector Silvio Magro pointed out that the accused was not sufficiently trustworthy to merit release from custody. Over the past week, while investigations were underway, the man had changed address three times and his residence was currently unknown, the court was told.
Moreover, whereas the inspector had reportedly handled the case in a gentlemanly manner, the accused had even challenged the officer to a fight while at the police station, alleging that the inspector was ‘racist’ in his regard.
Later, the man had allegedly kicked up some commotion when escorted to the police lockup.
The defence, while denying the allegations, pointed...

Share index climbs to over 4-month highFollowing the minimal declines registered in the previous two trading sessions, the share index rebounded by 0.35% today to an over four-month high of 4,744.232 points as the gains in the share prices of six equities outweighed the small dip in GO.
However, trading volumes were weak as only €0.13 million worth of shares changed hands.
Ahead of the publication of its interim financial results due this afternoon, Malta International Airport advanced 0.2% to a near four-month high of €4.21 on volumes totalling 5,800 shares. The airport operator is also expected to provide an updated guidance for 2017.
Also among the large companies by market capitalisation, HSBC (13,743 shares) and Bank of Valletta (16,015 shares) each gained 0.4% to €2.06 and €2.16,9 respectively. Tomorrow, BOV is scheduled to hold an extraordinary general meeting ahead of a €150 million rights issue.
BOV’s insurance associate – Mapfre Middlesea – was the best performing equity today with a jump of 3.7% to the €1.94 level after recovering from an intra-day low of €1.75 (-6.4%). Only 3,390 shares traded. On Monday, the company published its 2016 half-year results revealing a 24% improvement in pre-tax profits to...

Front Ħarsien ODZ to continue opposing Żonqor university plansActivist group Front Ħarsien ODZ will be formally objecting to plans to build a university campus on virgin land in Żonqor. 
In a statement, the group said that the proposed project was still in breach of planning policies including the local plan, which earmarked the proposed site for inclusion in a national park. 
 “We are calling on the government to include the land presently earmarked for a massive car park, student halls and sports facilities in the Inwadar park. It simply does not make sense to turn an area immediately next to the Inwadar Park into a construction and excavation site,« the group said in a statement, adding that the project could end up disturbing a nearby special protection area.
Front Ħarsien ODZ was set up in 2015 to coordinate opposition to the Żonqor university plans, and was behind massive, nationwide protests against the proposal to turn the Żonqor site into a university campus. 
Following the protests, the government announced scaled-back plans for the AUM campus in Żonqor, with the university also getting another campus in Cospicua. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had called the new proposal a »common sense compromise."

Celebrating 50 years of diplomatic ties with RussiaThe Republic Hall at the Mediterranean Conference Centre, in Valletta, on Friday hosted ballet, play and musical performance The Crystal Palace.
Held as part of the 50th anniversary of Russian-Maltese diplomatic relations, the show included a recreation of the atmosphere of the 18th century using original Baroque decorations and costumes, based on historical archives.
The music on the night was of the famous contemporary composer Alexey Shor, which was specially selected for this performance.

Mr Shor, like no other, connects Russia and Malta through his musical pieces.
Born in the former Soviet Union, he is now a composer-in-residence with the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra Academy.
The Crystal Palace takes place in 1740, at the court of the Empress Anna Ioannovna.
During a luxurious celebration, the Empress learns about two sweethearts and orders them to marry.

But the hearts of the lovers are not filled with joy. For the bride and the groom, by the order of the Empress, must spend the winter night after the nuptials in a specially erected palace, where the walls, the bed and even the flowers are made of ice.
Celebrities and special guests from Russia and Malta took part in the...

Imam laughs off talk of Muslim political partyImam Mohammad Elsadi denied speculation that he is testing the waters on the possibility of setting up an Islamic party with the aim of having the first Muslim MP in five years’ time.
The head of the Maltese Muslim community issued the denial when the Times of Malta sought clarification regarding a Facebook post in which he urged Muslim residents with the right to vote to furnish him with their personal details.
Mr Elsadi insisted the “project” was aimed to determine the strength of the Muslim community for “lobbying purposes”.
In his post, uploaded last Saturday, the Imam said an exercise was being carried out to have an accurate picture of the “exact” number of eligible Maltese Muslim voters, “to be used for the common good of the Muslim community”.
He urged local Muslims to supply their names, ID card numbers and electoral district registrations. He also asked for the particulars of those under 18. The information could be sent through mobile applications like Viber and WhatsApp, he said.
In another Facebook post, Mr Elsadi thanked his followers for the response, saying he already had enough information to start the “project”.

Released : Saturday, July 22, 2017 7:52 AMMSF says opening clinic is first step to new trauma hospital
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - The Geneva-based international health organization Medicins Sans Frontieres - also known as Doctors Without Borders - says it has opened an outpatient clinic in the city of Kunduz in northern Afghanistan. The announcement comes nearly two years after U.S. airstrikes devastated a trauma hospital the group operated in Kunduz, killing 42 people, including 14 MSF staff. Silvia Dallatomasina, head of MSF programs in Afghanistan, tells The Associated Press that Saturday's opening of the clinic is the first step to re-opening a trauma hospital in Kunduz. Dallatomasina says MSF has held more than 100 meetings with U.S. officials, the Afghan government and the various sides in the protracted conflict looking for an agreement that will guarantee their safety and the safety of their patients when the re-open.
Philippine Congress extends martial law in south amid siege
MANILA, Philippines (AP) - The Philippine Congress on Saturday overwhelmingly approved the president's appeal for martial law in the south to be extended to the end of the year to help troops quell a two-month siege by Islamic State group-linked militants and stamp out similar extremist plots in the volatile region. House of Representatives Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez announced that senators and House members voted 261-18 in favor of granting President Rodrigo Duterte's request in a special joint session. The 60-day martial law was to expire late Saturday. The military chief of staff, Gen. Eduardo Ano, warned during the session that aside from the uprising in Marawi, extremist groups have plotted similar insurrections in other southern cities and martial law has helped troops stop attacks, including bombings, elsewhere.
Minneapolis chief resigns after shooting of Australian woman
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Minneapolis police Chief Janee Harteau says she is "willing to step aside to let a fresh set of leadership eyes" be in charge of the department, which has been criticized in the wake of last weekend's fatal police shooting of an unarmed Australian woman who had called 911. Harteau's resignation Friday came at the request of Mayor Betsy Hodges, who said she lost confidence in the chief's "ability to lead us further." She said she asked Harteau to step down after assessing where the department needs to go. "For us to continue to transform policing - and community trust in policing - we need new leadership at MPD," Hodges said.
Historian asks Australian court to reveal Queen's letters
CANBERRA, Australia (AP) - A historian is going to court this month in an attempt to force Australian authorities to release secret letters that would reveal what Queen Elizabeth II knew of her representative's shocking scheme to dismiss Australia's government more than 40 years ago. The National Archives of Australia has categorized the correspondence between the British monarch, who is also Australia's constitutional head of state, and her Australian representative, Governor-General Sir John Kerr, as "personal" and might therefore never be made public. The letters would disclose what, if anything, the queen knew of Kerr's plan to dismiss Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's government in 1975 to resolve a month-old deadlock in Parliament.
'Darknet' suspect's flashy cars raised eyebrows in Thailand
BANGKOK (AP) - The neighbors had their suspicions. The young Canadian accused of masterminding the world's leading "darknet" internet marketplace lived a seemingly quiet life for more than a year with his Thai girlfriend in a middle-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Bangkok. But the flashy cars he drove stood out. There was the nearly $1 million, metallic gray Lamborghini. There was the Porsche, and then the Mini Cooper for his girlfriend. All in an area where people drive pickup trucks and children tool around on plastic tricycles. The neighbors thought 25-year-old Alexandre Cazes worked in the hotel business. But according to the U.S.
Pakistani inmate asks court to suspend practice of hanging
ISLAMABAD (AP) - A defense lawyer says a Pakistani death-row inmate has requested that a court suspend the "un-Islamic" practice of hanging prisoners because it is "too painful." Mohammad Khursheed Khan said Saturday his client is instead urging jail authorities to use lethal injections or some other mode of execution. Khan filed the petition this week. He said the court has sought a reply from the government on Jan Bahadur's petition by July 26. Khan said it was the first such petition filed before the Peshawar High Court. It was not immediately clear if a similar petition has ever been filed elsewhere in Pakistan.
Police: Errant US bombing kills 12 Afghan security forces
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - An errant U.S. airstrike confirmed by the Pentagon killed 12 Afghan National Police officers and wounded two others, Helmand provincial police chief Abdul Ghafar Safi said Saturday. The death toll in Friday's airstrike was determined after a site inspection of the compound in the Gereshk district, he said. The United States in a statement confirmed that the airstrike on the Security Forces compound happened during a U.S.-supported operation against Taliban insurgents in the area. In the statement the U.S. offered its condolences to the families of the security forces who were killed. While much of Helmand province is under the control of Taliban, Afghan national security forces have been waging fierce battles to retake territory.
US bans travel for Americans to NKorea after Warmbier death
WASHINGTON (AP) - American citizens will be barred by the U.S. from traveling to North Korea beginning next month following a prohibition on using U.S. passports to enter the country, the State Department said Friday. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson decided to impose a "geographical travel restriction" on North Korea following the death last month of American university student Otto Warmbier, who fell into a coma while in North Korean custody. The ban also comes amid heightened U.S. concern about Pyongyang's recent advancements in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Figures on how many Americans visit North Korea are difficult for even the U.S.
Hawaii prepares for 'unlikely' North Korea missile threat
HONOLULU (AP) - Hawaii is the first state to prepare the public for the possibility of a ballistic missile strike from North Korea. The state's Emergency Management Agency on Friday announced a public education campaign about what to do. Hawaii lawmakers have been urging emergency management officials to update Cold War-era plans for coping with a nuclear attack as North Korea develops nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles that can reach the islands. Starting in November, Hawaii will begin monthly tests of an "attack-warning" siren the state hasn't heard since the end of the Cold War in the 1980s. The wailing siren will be tested on the first working day of each month, after a test of an "attention-alert" steady tone siren with which residents are already familiar.
Mattis says US still debating 'big ideas' on Afghan plan
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration is still sorting out "the big ideas" for a new Afghanistan strategy, beyond troop levels and other military details, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Friday. "We're close," he said in an impromptu exchange with reporters at the Pentagon one day after President Donald Trump met with him and his military chiefs for a broad discussion that aides said touched on Afghanistan and other issues. The U.S. has been fighting in Afghanistan for nearly 16 years, and as recently as June Mattis said "we are not winning." Mattis told Sen. John McCain at a hearing last month that he would have the Afghanistan strategy ready by mid-July.Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.  All rights reserved.

                Marawi fighting led to 100 deaths, almost 60,000 displaced
            



                Military says surgical airstrikes needed in certain areas
            



Philippine forces said they’re in control of most of Marawi, the southern city where almost 100 people were killed and 60,000 displaced following clashes in the past week between the military and Muslim extremists linked to Islamic State.“Our ground commanders have assured that the end is almost there,” Brigadier General Restituto Padilla said in a televised briefing in Manila on Monday. Government troops are in control of Marawi “except in certain areas” that militants hold, making “surgical air strikes” necessary, he said.Philippine Marines take positions in Marawi city.Photographer: Jes Aznar/Getty ImagesThe crisis has claimed the lives of 19 civilians, 18 government troops and 61 extremists, according to presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella, making it the worst in the Mindanao region in almost four years. Almost 400 residents were rescued from Marawi, the most crowded city in the autonomous Muslim area with a population of 200,000.




President Rodrigo Duterte placed Mindanao under martial law on May 23 as insurgents in Marawi with Islamic State flags burned buildings, occupied offices and freed more than 100 inmates from jail. Duterte said on Saturday that military rule, limited by the Constitution to 60 days, will remain for as long as necessary, and the Supreme Court and Congress must not intervene.The U.S. Embassy received information that the Philippines placed the police on full alert throughout metropolitan Manila, with checkpoints and security patrols planned in the capital, according to a May 28 statement.Crisis TriggerFighting in Marawi started in the afternoon of May 23 as state enforcers tried to capture Isnilon Hapilon, a commander of the Abu Sayyaf militant group who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. Duterte said Marawi is home to the Maute group, which is led by brothers who were former Manila cops and later became drug traffickers to fund their terrorism.




The crisis is turning out to be the worst for Mindanao since the 2013 siege in Zamboanga City by Muslim rebels loyal to Nur Misuari, a conflict that led to the deaths of at least 203 people and burning of 10,000 homes. Duterte said on May 27 that he is open to Misuari’s offer to augment government troops with his own fighters.Financial markets have withstood the latest incident. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index has risen about 1 percent since the May 23 clashes and subsequent martial law declaration. The peso touched 50 per dollar on May 24 for the first time in two weeks but has since recovered to 49.838 on Monday afternoon.
