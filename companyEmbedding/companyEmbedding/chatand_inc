This prospectus relates to Units and shares of our common stock that may be 
offered and sold from time to time by the Company and the selling stockholders
named herein. 

We expect to receive gross proceeds of $3,000,000 if the minimum number of 
Units are sold in the Company Offering, and $8,000,000 if the maximum number 
of Units are sold in the Company Offering. We also may retain placement 
agents, where permitted by law, to assist us in the offering and selling of 
the shares of our common stock. In the event we elect to utilize placement 
agents for sale of the shares of our common stock, we will amend this 
prospectus. We will not receive any proceeds from the selling stockholder 
offering.  We expect to utilize between $1.2 million (minimum) and $2.4 
million (maximum) of the proceeds for technology development, and up to 
$400,000 for investor relations.  The balance of the proceeds we expect to 
use for general working capital.  We may utilize a portion of the proceeds 
for synergistic acquisitions and strategic mergers, although we have no 
current plans and have not entered into any discussions in that regard.  We 
will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling 
stockholders other than the exercise price of any warrants that are exercised 
by the applicable selling stockholders who do not conduct cashless exercises.
If all of the warrants are exercised for cash, then we will receive gross 
proceeds of approximately $5,637,500.  No assurances can be given, however, 
that all or any portion of such warrants will ever be exercised.


The markets for online engagement technology and online customer services are 
intensely competitive and characterized by aggressive marketing, evolving 
industry standards, rapid technology developments, and frequent new product 
introductions. However, many of the current competitors to ChatAnd are software
providers building their technology on the backbone of legacy hardware, 
architecture, systems and software. Examples of market participants attempting 
to migrate into ChatAnd’s planned direction include: 

   ·  LivePerson – legacy text chat system built for customer support  

   ·  FuzeMeeting – primary focus is video-conferencing  

   ·  BoldChat – an hosted text chat system rather than SaaS  

   ·  WhosOn & Talisma Chat – SaaS and hosted text chat  

These competitors, some of whom hold significant client bases, have business 
models and technology that require enhancements or major overhauls as the 
market shifts from text based chat to the more engaging live audio and video 
chat technologies. 
  
Competitive Technology 
Video chat can be viewed as the third generation of live chat support. 

   ·  Text-based Chat: Original live customer support was provided using 
      text-based chat technology Initially it appeared at the request of 
      customers on e-commerce websites, but later appeared on a variety of 
      websites and on a proactive basis offering supportive to customers during
      the sales process.  

   ·  Audio-based Chat: This technology later became available to further 
      engage customers on a reactive and proactive basis. While the audio 
      feature adds a second dimension to the chat experience, the added value 
      has proven minimally effective.  

Three Primary Competitors 

In addition to larger and well financed companies, we believe there are three 
direct competitors to the ChatAnd platform. Each of these competitors feature 
live video chat technology, and a variety of other features and underlying 
business models that will challenge ChatAnd in the market place. 

   ·  LiveGuide from Netop: This SaaS solution offers Text, Audio and Video 
      Chat features but does not provide a Click to Call feature. Netop is 
      primarily a software vendor without the deep operational expertise 
      offered by ChatAnd to assist clients in improving sales conversion rates 
      with its advisory services.  

   ·  VeeDesk from Vee24: This product provides an integrated work station with
      expensive television quality video equipment but lacks many of the 
      software features offered by ChatAnd. They are positioned as in 
      integrated high-end solution.  

   ·  LiveExpert from ClairVista: This technology company provides a SaaS 
      engagement solution that can be incorporated into client websites or 
      operated in proprietary kiosks for on-site applications.  

Other Competition 

In addition to the primary competitors mentioned previously, there is a 
substantial group of small companies that are also considered competition to 
ChatAnd. These companies generally have niche offerings and compete on price 
and features, although the features are generally quite similar. Their systems 
are typically older technology and are hosted solutions built for text chat. 
While these customer engagement firms are part of the direct engagement market,
there are a host of potential secondary competitors that could decide to enter 
ChatAnd’s marketplace. 

   ·  Searchable knowledge management applications  

   ·  Email service providers  

   ·  Lead generation companies  

   ·  Web analytics and online marketing service providers  

   ·  CRM and other enterprise software companies  

   ·  In-house online engagement solutions  

   ·  Traditional offline customer service solutions, such as telephone call 
      centers  
  
Competitive Forces 

we believes that competition will increase as our current competitors 
increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter
the market. Compared to ChatAnd, some of our larger current and potential 
competitors may have: 

   ·  Stronger brand recognition;  

   ·  Existing customer relationships;  

   ·  A wider range of products and services; and  

   ·  Greater financial, marketing and research and development resources.  

Additionally, some competitors may enter into strategic or commercial 
relationships with larger, more established and better-financed companies, 
enabling them to: 

   ·  Undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;  

   ·  Adopt more aggressive pricing policies;  

   ·  Make more attractive offers to businesses to induce them to use their 
      products or services; and  

   ·  Develop technology innovations.  

Any change in the general market acceptance of the real-time sales, marketing 
and customer service solution business model or in online, real-time consumer 
advice services may harm our competitive position.  

Such changes may allow our competitors additional time to improve their service
or product offerings, and would also provide time for new competitors to 
develop real-time sales, marketing, customer service and Web analytics 
applications or competitive consumer service offerings and solicit prospective 
clients within our target markets. Increased competition could result in 
pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and loss of market share.


Company Description
chatAND, Inc. intends to provide online assistance, engagement and conversion 
solutions to e-commerce businesses by allowing real-time assistance to website 
visitors utilizing Video Conferencing, Screen Sharing and Collaborative 
Co-Browsing to increase sales conversion rates.  The proposed


 technology 
platform connects businesses and their sales associates and customer service 
representatives (CSR’s), with website visitors and online shoppers seeking 
assistance while browsing their respective websites.  The Chat& software is 
a 100% hosted no download application that will allow a company’s live sales 
and support staff to connect directly with customers via 1-to-1 real-time 
sessions. 

Utilizing the powerful tools of Video-Chat and Co-Browsing (the joint 
navigation through the Internet by two or more people accessing the same 
web pages at the same time) Chat& aims to redefine the online shopping 
experience by recreating virtually all of the benefits of a live showroom 
environment.  This Virtual e-showroom” will allow both customers and sales 
support staff to navigate the website together in real time while in a video 
conference.  Our technology will allow our clients and their websites to 
offer a more personalized and relevant sales environment. The face-to-face 
component of Video-Chat alone is an incredibly powerful conversion tool; 
with the addition of Co-Browsing, Chat& aims to change the landscape of
e-commerce.  Chat&’s proposed video technology, online co-browsing and 
collaboration tools together with our e-commerce knowledge and internet 
marketing expertise, will help our clients by increasing sales, as well 
as customer satisfaction. 

Bridging the gap between visitor traffic and desired sales conversion 
goals, our proposed technology aims to deliver precise and measurable 
returns by empowering our clients to: 

   ·  Reduce shopping abandonment and increase sales conversion rates by 
      intelligently interacting and engaging customers ased upon their specific
      behavior  
  
   ·  Increase average order values  

   ·  Increase customer satisfaction  

   ·  Reduce attrition rates of existing customers  

   ·  Increase quantity of line items per order  

   ·  Increase average total shopping cart value  

With the emergence of Apple’s facetime, Skype Video-Chat and other similar 
Video-Chat applications into the mainstream, and the increase in internet 
bandwidth (Wimax, 4G) sales and support has moved from a two-dimensional 
experience. Simple text chat, which currently dominates the support market, 
will no longer be enough to satisfy the marketplace. It is only a matter of 
time until Video-Chat becomes  the standard form of communication. With that 
in mind, Chat& intends for its application to be at the forefront of this new 
method of commerce, communication and collaboration. 

The Company has no operating history and has not generated any revenues to 
date, and accordingly investors will be unable to assess the Company’s 
profitability to perform. 

The Company is in the midst of its initial phase of development.  We continue 
to develop the technology that will allow video support and chat based 
co-browsing to our clients.  The initial version of the platform is a basic 
scaled down version that will allow a customer and sales representative to 
conduct a 1-1 video session and they will both be allowed to view the same 
browsing screen simultaneously. There are additional features that we 
anticipate that will be required for us to add in later development phases 
that are not currently part of our platform, and that some of our competitors 
currently offer. 

We expect to utilize between $1.2 million (minimum) and $2.4 million (maximum) 
of the proceeds for technology development, and up to $400,000 for investor 
relations.  The balance of  the proceeds we expect to use for general working 
capital. 

There are myriad potential circumstances that could be impediments to our 
success, including: our ability to be competitive in attracting qualified 
developers and key personnel,  our ability to respond to the rapid 
technological change and changing client preferences, and the fact that we 
will be dependent on technology systems and third-party content that are 
beyond our control.
