Our Customers Say it Best






“AdvanceClaim™ is user friendly. There are only two billing screens, which makes billing each claim quick. Sending claims electronically is as simple as a push of a button; all payers can be sent together and some of our payments are received within five days of sending the claims! EOBs are automatically uploaded into AdvanceClaim™. Posting payments using this feature is accurate, and because the system does most of it, there is less room for human error. This is the first Web-based program we have used and the automatic updates processed during the night hours eliminate down time with my staff.

											Jocelyn Booker
											Director of Reimbursement, Delta Ambulance





For those patients whose insurance was not available at the time of call-intake, we have seen roughly 30-40% return of valid insurance through the IE system. The system is easy to use. Once the basic demographic information is available, a single click and date selection returns the results. The fact that this is integrated directly into our billing software is a true advantage over having to switch system interfaces or wade through phone system menus.

											Steve Higgins
											RN/EMT-I, Executive Vice President, Priority Patient Transport, Inc.





The crew SMS notifications and the color changes for units that remain on scene too long are great visual indicators. We have been able to adjust our staffing and truck times accordingly.  This has increased our use of peak trucks and decreased our idle times. I have emailed our primary contact often and they always route the questions to the right people right away. The MedaPoint team works hard to meet our requests.

											Dianna Tatum
											Nurse Manager, Cape Fear Valley

MedaPoint, Inc. Announces AdvanceOne™ Product Suite, AdvanceCare™ ePCR








Thu, Jul 9, 2015









































AUSTIN, Texas – Texas-based EMS software company MedaPoint, Inc. announces its new 100% Web-based, end-to-end solution, AdvanceOne. The fully-integrated product suite comes to fruition with the unveiling of the company’s new ePCR (Electronic Patient Care Report) application, AdvanceCare. With this development, AdvanceOne comes full circle, facilitating the complete patient-care cycle – from dispatch to care documentation to billing – through one secure cloud-based system.
“MedaPoint’s now end-to-end solution is simple, integrated and intuitive,” said MedaPoint CEO John Dadey. “Our system is easy to learn and implement, requiring minimal training and little upfront investment compared to other solutions.”
AdvanceOne is comprised of three fully-integrated Web-based EMS applications – AdvanceDispatch, a dispatch operations and fleet management solution; AdvanceCare, the new ePCR application; and AdvanceClaim, an EMS billing solution. Each of the applications can be utilized as standalone solutions, as well as within the context of one cohesive workflow solution.
According to MedaPoint President Eric Becker, the company’s breakthrough technology allows EMS staffs to address the entire patient cycle through a single, seamless interface, from any location at any time. Elimination of redundancy and human error also shifts the focus from data-entry to informed decision-making.[Native Advertisement]
“EMS practitioners will no longer have to use multiple systems or deal with paperwork,” Becker said. “All patient data will be centralized through this product suite, improving efficiencies and giving EMS businesses what they need to excel in the competitive industry landscape.”
AdvanceCare Product Director Billy Craft stated that the new secure, cloud-based ePCR will automate workflows and simplify the care documentation process, which has traditionally been completed on paper or through a standalone software application. With AdvanceCare, field crews can log in and share information from any Android™ or iOS™ device, as well as produce ready-to-bill claims through one-click NEMSIS 3 export.
“We are building AdvanceCare using the best available technology to create the best experience possible for users of an EMS documentation system,” Craft said.  “Users include field providers, supervisory staff, administrators and all other stake-holders within the scope of an agency’s documentation system.”
The AdvanceOne platform will be available using a pay-as-you-go model. It will be accessible from any device, at any time and from any location. Enterprise-level security and ongoing HIPAA, ICD-10 and HITECH compliance will be automated.
Available for sale starting Aug. 1, MedaPoint will publically debut AdvanceOne offering demos at the Pinnacle 2015 EMS Conference in Amelia Island, Fla., from Aug. 3-7.

MedaPoint, Inc. Announces AdvanceOne™ Product Suite, AdvanceCare™ ePCR





















100% Web-based, end-to-end EMS software, one  solution for complete patient cycleAUSTIN,  Texas – Texas-based EMS software company MedaPoint,  Inc. announces its new 100% Web-based, end-to-end solution, AdvanceOne. The  fully-integrated product suite comes to fruition with the unveiling of the  company’s new ePCR (Electronic Patient Care Report) application, AdvanceCare.  With this development, AdvanceOne comes full circle, facilitating the complete  patient-care cycle – from dispatch to care documentation to billing – through  one secure cloud-based system. “MedaPoint’s  now end-to-end solution is simple, integrated and intuitive,” said MedaPoint  CEO John Dadey. “Our system is easy to learn and implement, requiring minimal  training and little upfront investment compared to other solutions.” 



AdvanceOne  is comprised of three fully-integrated Web-based EMS applications –  AdvanceDispatch, a dispatch operations and fleet management solution;  AdvanceCare, the new ePCR application; and AdvanceClaim, an EMS billing  solution. Each of the applications can be utilized as standalone solutions, as  well as within the context of one cohesive workflow solution. According  to MedaPoint President Eric Becker, the company’s breakthrough technology  allows EMS staffs to address the entire patient cycle through a single,  seamless interface, from any location at any time. Elimination of redundancy  and human error also shifts the focus from data-entry to informed  decision-making. “EMS  practitioners will no longer have to use multiple systems or deal with  paperwork,” Becker said. “All patient data will be centralized through this  product suite, improving efficiencies and giving EMS businesses what they need  to excel in the competitive industry landscape.” AdvanceCare  Product Director Billy Craft stated that the new secure, cloud-based ePCR will  automate workflows and simplify the care documentation process, which has  traditionally been completed on paper or through a standalone software  application. With AdvanceCare, field crews can log in and share information  from any Android™ or iOS™ device, as well as produce ready-to-bill claims  through one-click NEMSIS 3 export. “We  are building AdvanceCare using the best available technology to create the best  experience possible for users of an EMS documentation system,” Craft  said.  “Users include field providers, supervisory staff, administrators  and all other stake-holders within the scope of an agency’s documentation  system.” The  AdvanceOne platform will be available using a pay-as-you-go model. It will be  accessible from any device, at any time and from any location. Enterprise-level  security and ongoing HIPAA, ICD-10 and HITECH compliance will be automated. Available  for sale starting Aug. 1, MedaPoint will publically debut AdvanceOne offering  demos at the Pinnacle 2015 EMS Conference in Amelia Island, Fla., from Aug.  3-7. About  MedaPointFounded  in 2009 and based in Austin, Texas, MedaPoint is revolutionizing emergency  medical services by delivering efficient, state-of-the-art billing, ePCR and  dispatch solutions which are both affordable and accessible. Built upon  groundbreaking technology and dynamic vision, MedaPoint’s applications  currently support more than 1,500 private and municipal emergency medical  service providers throughout the United States.
