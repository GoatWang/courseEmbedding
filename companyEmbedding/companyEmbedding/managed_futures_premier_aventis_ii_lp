This is not an offer to purchase or sell securities. This website is for informational purposes and nothing contained herein is an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in Straits Financial Premier (U.S. Feeder) Fund I, L.P. (the “Fund”), and may not be relied upon in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.

Futures trading is speculative and involves a high degree of risk.  Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

By accessing this site, you hereby represent that you are an accredited investor as defined in Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 501 under the Securities Act of 1933. Specifically, an accredited investor is defined as meeting one or more of the following qualifications:

A.	An individual whose net worth, or joint net worth with spouse, exceeds $1,000,000 as of the date of a subscription agreement.   Net worth means the excess of total assets at fair market value, excluding one’s primary residence, over total liabilities.  In making this determination, the related amount of indebtedness secured by the primary residence up to its fair market value may be excluded in calculating net worth.  However, indebtedness secured by the residence in excess of the value of the home is considered a liability and should be deducted from net worth.

B.	An individual whose gross income exceeded $200,000 in each of the two most recent calendar years, or whose joint gross income with the individual’s spouse exceeded $300,000 in each of the two most recent calendar years and, in either case, the individual has reasonable expectation of his single or joint gross income, respectively, reaching the same level in the current year.

C.	A partnership, corporation, limited liability company or business trust that either (i) is 100% owned by individuals who are accredited investors under (a) or (b) above, or (ii) was not formed for the specific purpose of investing in the Fund and whose total assets exceed $5,000,000.
D.

 Managed Future Funds Fees & Expenses Class Action Lawsuit 

 
  

In November 2013, Bloomberg published a startling report about the fees and expenses some fund managers charge investors in “managed-futures” funds.  The conclusion was that in dozens and dozens of managed futures funds, the managers charged fees and expenses that totaled 89% of all the profit of that given fund.
A managed-futures fund  is an alternative investment, which is often defined as an investment other than cash, stocks, or bonds.  Typically these investments are sold to investors through brokers and many large brokerage houses have there own proprietary managed futures investments.  BarcalyHedge estimates that over $331 billion was invested in managed accounts in mid 2013.

SEC reporting requirements 
One difference between managed futures funds and say typical stocks and bonds is that in general managed futures funds are not required to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC does however require that all managed futures funds with more than 500 investors and more than $10 million in assets file financial reports within 120 days of their fiscal year’s end.  Bloomberg as part of its investigation concluded that there are currently 63 managed-futures funds that fit into this category. The vast majority of managed-futures funds, therefore, have no reporting requirement, as they are not subject to the 500 Investor Rule.

	Bloomberg’s big ciscovery regarding managed futures funds fees and expenses
Bloomberg concluded that managed-futures funds can charge clients 7% to 9% each year of the investment amount in the fund plus 20 percent of the funds’ profits.  (Hedge funds typically only charge a 2% management fee plus 20% of investor profits.)
Bloomberg next concluded that for the period from Jan. 1, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2012, a stunning 89% of the $11.51 billion of gains in these 63 managed-futures funds went to fees, commissions and expenses collected by the fund managers—not to investors. 

	One example: Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P.
30,000 people invested approximately $797 million in Morgan Stanley's managed-futures fund called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P. From 2002 through 2012, the fund made approximately $490 million in trading gains and interest income. However, investors ended up losing money because those profits were depleted by over $498 million in commissions, expenses and fees paid to fund managers and Morgan Stanley. Despite the fund's value increase of approximately $490 million, investors ended up losing approximately $8 million over the course of those 10 years.

However, a Bloomberg article has raised questions concerning the suitability of managed futures funds. According to the article, from 2003 to 2012, 89% of the futures fund trading profits and interest for 63 SEC-registered funds were consumed by fees and commissions leaving investors with little profit for their investment. In the wake of the article’s revelations the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has opened an investigation into the high fees charged to investors.As a background, the expected gross return to a fully collateralized futures position equals the return to a cash investment plus compensation for the risk borne in the collateral investment. For stocks and stock index futures the compensation is the expected return on the stock market. For other underlying investments, the expected returns is often less. Thus, a managed futures fund investment with 7 to 9% annual expenses on average will earn much less than stocks and bonds over the same period of time due to the commissions and fees taken from the fund by the managers and the brokerage firm each year that would otherwise be available to the investors.The failure of managed futures funds is also backed up by empirical research. From January 2003 through the end of 2012, the Bloomberg article found that Morgan Stanley had 30,000 customers to invest $797 million into a managed-futures fund called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P. The prospectus for Spectrum Technical fund stated that the fund was potentially profitable “when traditional markets are experiencing losses” and recommended the fund as a way to diversify an investor’s holdings beyond traditional stocks and bonds. The prospectus also allegedly boasted that over a twenty-three year period investors who placed ten percent of their assets in managed futures outperformed portfolios comprised only of stocks and bonds.The Spectrum Technical fund earned $490.3 million in trading gains and income from 2003 through 2012 according to the article. Nonetheless, investors who remained in the fund during this period did not receive any of the returns because the manager’s and Morgan Stanley’s commissions, expenses, and fees paid totaled $498.7 million. Thus, Spectrum Technical investors lost $8.3 million for no other reason than the fees charged to the fund were greater than the gains.Below are some managed futures funds we are currently investigating:The Morgan Stanley/Ceres Managed-Futures Funds:Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P.Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P.Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Currency and Commodity L.P.Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Global Balanced L.P.Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P.Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Select L.P.Polaris Futures Fund L.P.Meritage Futures Fund L.P.LV Futures Fund L.P.Managed Futures Premier BHM, L.P.Managed Futures Premier Graham L.P.Managed Futures Premier Aventis II L.P.Managed Futures Premier Warrington L.P.Merrill Lynch Managed-Futures Funds:ML Systematic Momentum FuturesAccess LLCMan AHL FuturesAccess LLCML Aspect FuturesAccess LLCML Winton FuturesAccess LLCML BlueTrend FuturesAccess LLCML Transtrend DTP Enhanced FuturesAccess LLCOther Managed-Futures Funds:Grant Park Futures Fund LPAltegris Winton Futures Fund LPCampbell Strategic Allocation Fund L.P.RJO Global Trust               Contact Us  Toll Free: 800-810-4262          Name (Required)      Email (Required)      Phone (Required)       Message         Enter text from the Image Above: Please enter the text from the image on the left.
