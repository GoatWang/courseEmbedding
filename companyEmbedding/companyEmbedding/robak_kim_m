Kim RobakBasic factsOrganization:Mueller Robak LLCRole:Senior PartnerLocation:Lincoln, Neb.Education:University of Nebraska-Lincoln(B.S.)University of Nebraska College of Law(J.D.)
 

Kim Robak is a senior partner with Mueller Robak LLC, a lobbying and government relations firm in Lincoln, Neb.[1]  She joined the firm in 2004.[2] From 1993 to 1999, she was Lieutenant Governor of Nebraska.[3]

Career
Kim Robak's career began as a teacher in Lincoln public schools from 1979 to 1982.  In 1982, she worked on Bob Kerrey's (D) successful gubernatorial campaign.[3] From 1985 to 1991, Robak was a partner with Remboldt, Ludtke, Parger and Berger law firm.[2]  In 1991, then-Governor of Nebraska Ben Nelson (D) named her his legal counsel and, in 1992, promoted her to be his chief of staff.[4]  In 1993, Gov. Nelson (D) named Robak Lieutenant Governor of Nebraska.  She was elected to that office in 1994.[2]
Robak left office to take an appointment at the University of Nebraska as vice president for external affairs and corporation secretary to the board of regents.[2]  She started that position in January 1999.[3] University president Dennis Smith, who appointed Robak to the position, called her "a bright, outstanding young woman."[3]  Her responsibilities included responsibility for federal and state government relations, media relations, communications and marketing for the university.  She was also the chief administrative officer for the board of regents.[2]
In December 2004, Robak left the University of Nebraska to take a partnership position with Ruth and Mueller LLC, a Lincoln, Neb.-based lobbying and government relations firm co-founded by her husband, William Mueller.  The firm was renamed Ruth, Mueller and Robak LLC and later, upon co-founder Larry Ruth's retirement, renamed Mueller Robak LLC.[2][5]
In 2008, Robak served in an organizational capacity for Obama for America.[6] In 2012, The Washington Times reported that she was a "touted prospect" to run for retiring Democratic Senator Ben Nelson's seat in the United States Senate.  She decided not to pursue the seat.[7]  In 2012, she was named to the list of Top 500 Influencers in American Politics by Campaigns & Elections Magazine,[8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
