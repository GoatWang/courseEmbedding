					Full Description



Technical Communications Corporation, incorporated on June 27, 1961, is engaged in the design, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of communications security devices, systems, and services. The secure communications solutions provided by the Company protect information transmitted over a range of data, video, fax and voice networks. The Company's products are sold to governments, military agencies, telecommunications carriers, financial institutions and multinational corporations. Its products can be used to protect confidentiality in communications between radios, telephones, mobile phones, facsimile machines and data network equipment over wires, fiber optic cables, radio waves, and microwave and satellite links.Government SystemsThe Company's DSD 72A-SP Military Bulk Ciphering System is a military system that provides cryptographic security for data networks operating at up to 34 million bits per second. The product supports a variety of interfaces and is designed to integrate into existing networks. Secure communication is achieved with communication synchronization methods built to maintain connections in error and jamming environments, such as radio relay networks, missile systems and microwave systems. Its DSD 72A-SP (STM) SONET/SDH network encryptor meets the environmental and operational requirements for military environments and operates at 155 megabits per second (Mb/s) and 622 Mb/s performance.The Company's DSP 9000 Radio Security family of products offers security for voice and data communications sent over high frequency (HF), very HF (VHF) and ultra HF (UHF) channels. These products are also radio independent because software programmable interfaces allow radio interface levels to be changed without configuring the hardware. All versions interoperate with its HSE 6000 Squad Radio Headset and Telephone Encryptor for cross-network secure voice conferencing. The DSP 9000 base station model also interoperates with the Company's CSD 3324 SE secure telephone system to enable office-to-field communications. Its HSE 6000 Squad Radio Headset and Telephone Encryptor is designed for public safety special operations and land mobile radio applications, as well as military applications. With the optional Telephone Interconnect Kit, the HSE 6000 connects to corded handset telephones for secure voice communications and radio-to-telephone conferencing over Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), digital, and analog telephone networks. It is also interoperable with the DSP 9000 radio security product family, enabling secure voice communications and cross-network conferencing across and between air, land, sea and office.Network Security SystemsThe Company offers network encryption systems with KEYNET centralized key and device management for Internet Protocol (IP), Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and frame relay networks to secure data in transit from local area network to local area network and across wide area networks. Cipher X 7211 IP Encryption with KEYNET IP Manager provides strategic-level secure communications for IP networks for point-to-point and multicast applications such as video conferencing. It offers a combination of flexibility, scalable one gigabit per second performance and KEYNET IP Manager. The Cipher X 7211 is a hardware-based, FIPS 140-2 Level 3 designed encryption device. The DSD 72B-SP and DSD 72A-SP (STM) encryption family with KEYNET Optical Manager provides strategic-level path encryption of voice, data and video transmitted over SONET/SDH networks at wirespeed 155 Mb/s and 622 Mb/s performance. The DSD 72B-SP family interoperates with any standard SDH or SONET network element. The DSD 72B-SP family is interoperable with the DSD 72A-SP (STM) SONET/SDH encryptor for military environments. The Company's Cipher X 7100 Frame Relay Encryption with KEYNET key and device management secures data transmitted over frame relay networks at up to two megabits per second.Secure Office SystemsThe Company's CSD 4100 Executive Secure Telephone offers strategic-level voice and data security in an executive telephone package. The product provides various security features, such as automated key management, authentication, certification and access control. The CipherTalk 8500 secure mobile phone is designed to provide military-grade encrypted voice and text communications anywhere in the world over GSM and Wi-Fi networks. The CipherTalk 8500 IP-based secure wireless phone is built on an Android smartphone platform.The Company competes with Crypto AG, Thales Group, Motorola Solutions, Inc., General Dynamics Corporation, Omnisec AG, Cisco Systems, Inc., Certes Networks, Inc., Gemalto N.V., Harris Corporation and Silent Circle, Inc.
