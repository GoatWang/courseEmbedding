Publisher's Description▼▲
Nine years after Rom Sebastian was thrust into the most unlikely of circumstances as hero and bearer of an unimaginable secret, the alliance of his followers is in disarray. An epic battle with The Order has left them scattered and deeply divided both in strategy and resolve in their struggle to become truly alive and free.Only 49 truly alive followers remain loyal to Rom. This meager band must fight for survival as The Order is focused on their total annihilation. Misunderstood and despised, their journey will be one of desperation against a new, more intensely evil Order. As the hand of this evil is raised to strike and destroy them they must rely on their faith in the abiding power of love to overcome all and lead them to sovereignty.SOVEREIGN wonderfully continues the new testament allegory that was introduced in FORBIDDEN and continued in MORTAL.


Author Bio▼▲
TED DEKKER is a New York Times bestselling author of more than thirty novels with a total of more than 10 million books in print. He is known for thrillers that combine adrenaline-laced plots with incredible confrontations between good and evil.

            Ted Dekker is one of my favorite authors.  I sometimes explain his style as a Christian Stephen King.  Paring him with Tosca Lee you know that you are in for a treat.  You can pull for your favorite character, but they don't always win and you can't always figure out what will happen, who is good, who is bad, will bad become good, will good become bad.  Another series in the style of the Circle series.

            In the world of Sovereigns, Immortals, and Dark Bloods, only one group can survive. Pitted against each other, a Sovereign alchemist creates a virus that will wipe out the Immortals and Dark Bloods. Two Sovereign leaders set out to warn the heads of the other groups of their demise, if they do not become Sovereign themselves. Dekker and Lee take you at a breakneck pace into a complex and intelligent allegory of life and death, love and hate, and the cost of both. While the plot is complicated and twisted, you never lose your way and question the validity of a character. They weave a story that is intellectually challenging, while not losing spiritual depth. Remarkable and fascinating, with those moments of "gasp."

            This book was an outstanding wrapup to the Mortals triology. The plot kept you guessing until the very end and there was also the teaser at the end of the blood vial being hidden, which left some more mystery....................

                This review was written for Sovereign, Books of Mortals Series #3.
            
 
            Ted Dekker and Tosca Lee have again combined their tremendous writing talent in "Sovereign", the third installment of "The Book of Mortals" series. As with the first two books, the scenes are vividly drawn, the writing is crisp, and the words flow smoothly, sweeping you up into the power of the story. From the start, the scenes explode with action, and I was immediately gripped by the opening chapters as good clashes with evil. My favourite character in this story is easily that of Jordin, who wrestles with doubt and whether she's making the right choices, but ultimately has a powerful encounter that opens her eyes to truth and to love. All of the characters are very well-developed, and I enjoyed the twists that are written into the story, where nothing is black and white, and even the villains invoke sympathy. The authors have created a book and an entire series that has so many parallels to the Christian walk and what Jesus accomplished through his death and through the abundant life he offers us. As such, the book can be read purely for entertainment value, or you can ponder the deeper truths woven into the story. I did find that the book dragged a bit for me in the middle, but by the end I was glued to the pages to see how everything would resolve. I closed the pages thinking about the strength of my own faith in Jesus and how fully I've allowed his truth to bring freedom into every part of my life. Any book that has me mulling over issues of faith while providing an absorbing ride is definitely worth reading!


Sovereign provides a rich adventure, and readers who have enjoyed the first two books in the series are certain to be pleased with this addition. I strongly recommend this book and award it 4 out of 5 stars.

Good design looks great, yes — but why shouldn't it also feel great, smell great and sound great? Designer Jinsop Lee (a TED Talent Search winner) shares his theory of 5-sense design, with a handy graph and a few examples. His hope: to inspire you to notice great multisensory experiences.

Lee Bros Dining Experiences!
Posted on Jun 9, 2016 4:40 pm

We’re often asked, “Where’s your restaurant?” and though we don’t have one (thank heavens!), we’ve recently found a solution to the challenge of how to share our food with groups of people, both visitors and locals, in Charleston. Thanks to our collaboration with Duvall Events, the preeminent caterer in the Charleston area, we are able to bring breakfasts, lunches and dinners of our own design to you, in settings ranging from restaurant-like dining rooms to private homes, yachts, creekside shrimp docks, large halls—you name it. We design a menu (with wine pairings if you wish) for you and your group, and supervise and help produce, from purchasing to quality control to prep—we even chop onions.  We can host or preside at your event, say a few words or an entire lecture, mingle at cocktail hour or sit down and join you for the entire affair. Duvall Events’ expert chefs, service staff and logistics experts make it happen with professionalism and grace.
Groups who have booked us in the past especially appreciate the “high touch” we bring, the depth of information about Charleston, its people, ingredients and traditions, that extra connection to the place that makes the time you spend here truly distinctive and meaningful. If you are interested in finding out more about this kind of experience, please give Duvall Events a call at 843-763-9222 and ask for Emma Lesesne-Booth. We look forward to working with you!

  – Matt and Ted

In Memoriam: Mrs. Sassard
Posted on Jan 27, 2014 4:03 pm

Charleston lost a culinary icon last week with the passing of Gertrude Sassard, who along with her late husband, Dupree, her son, Allen, and daughter-in-law Dayna, ran “Mrs. Sassard’s Handmade,” a Mount Pleasant-based manufacturer of premium pickles, preserves, jams, and jellies, founded in 1917. In addition to being a tireless worker, Gertrude was a great storyteller and wit, whose bemused skepticism about the capabilities of those around her—particularly her wholesale customers—kept everyone laughing around the production kitchen. A great part of the pleasure of collecting our cases of Iced Tomato Pickles and Pickled Peaches from the Sassard house on Church Street was visiting with Gertrude, who typically could be found in the production kitchen peeling sunchokes with a paring knife— and she could peel fast. “Made its way by the way it’s made” is the company slogan, and well describes the effort that goes into everything Gertrude touched, from the artichokes, to the hand-peeled Pickled Peaches, to the whole fig preserves, Jerusalem artichoke relish, and the rare Pumpkin Chip Preserves. We are saddened greatly by her passing, but thanks to her son Allen, who continues in her footsteps, we know the products we love so much will remain on Lowcountry tables for years to come, in the company of great memories of Gertrude Sassard.

Lee Bros. Announce Partnership with Duvall Catering & Event Design
Posted on May 20, 2013 11:06 am

The Lee Bros. are pleased to announce a partnership with Duvall Catering. Together the partners will produce one-of-a-kind events that combine Duvall’s hallmark finesse with the Lee Bros.’ sense of Charleston flavor and style.
“We reach a wide audience with our cookbooks, but rarely do we have the opportunity to show
people, in person, our cooking,” said Matt Lee. “Teaming up with Duvall allows us to share what
we do, in real time, with groups of all sizes and interests.”
From intimate luncheons to full-scale weddings, planners will be offered the opportunity to
incorporate The Lee Bros. elements into their special events. Planners may select from a number
of menus designed by The Lee Bros. and even book the duo to appear at their event.
“Matt and Ted have drawn a bead on what makes Charleston and its cooking so unique,” said Steve Wenger, Duvall CEO. “We’re excited to tap their expertise and give our clients added options, value, and a connection to the Lowcountry for their events.”
Matt and Ted first partnered with Duvall and the company’s Executive Chef, Matt Greene, last
fall for a fundraiser hosted at GrowFood Carolina. The meal that resulted—a six-course dinner
for 150 people in GrowFood’s wholesale produce warehouse on Morrison Drive—elicited raves
from diners and set off light bulbs in the minds of the two parties.
“We’ve always admired the technical expertise of professional caterers, but Chef Greene’s team
raised the bar for us,” said Ted Lee. “Duvall took our vision for a rather complicated menu of
rarefied Lowcountry ingredients and never flinched from the challenge. If anything, Chef Greene
pushed us to take bigger risks than we’d planned with the recipes.”
Duvall’s new 10,000 square-foot facility on Azalea Drive gives the team access to back-of-house
amenities as well as a state-of-the-art demonstration kitchen able to accommodate up to 60
guests. The Lee Bros. will commemorate the new alliance with a demonstration for Charleston-based event planners and tour guides later this month. There are also plans to work with Duvall to create retail products in their USDA-inspected kitchen.
“We’ve been searching for a way to package boiled peanuts as wedding favors and we think we
have the tools we need now,” Matt said.
This spring, Matt and Ted published their third cookbook, The Lee Bros. Charleston Kitchen,
which Pat Conroy called “a work of art” and which The Wall Street Journal called “a
gastronomic tour-de-force.” Their first two cookbooks, The Lee Bros. Southern Cookbook and The Lee Bros. Simple Fresh Southern have won a combined five James Beard and IACP cookbook awards.
Matt and Ted: “Ok, that was the official announcement, but we just have to add that we are stoked for this!! Our association with the company began in the 1980s: Mom and Dad were frequent customers, and the original owners became close family friends. In fact, the sewing machine we used to stitch up the first Lee Bros. Boiled Peanuts Catalogue was a gift from Peter Milewicz.”
The business was sold to the current owner, Steven Wenger, in about 1990, and Duvall’s role as the category leader in the Charleston area has only grown under his keen leadership in the decades since. Duvall’s staff is super-smart, incredibly hard-working, resourceful and fun. Their gigantic new facility just north of the city will give us the resources—including a USDA inspected food processing kitchen—to pursue a wide range of projects and opportunities that may come our way in the years ahead.  We have already pulled off some spectacular dinners for Family Circle Cup and for HGTV, and are excited beyond belief about the possibilities. Visit Duvallevents.com or phone 843.763.9222 to get the ball rolling on an unforgettable Charleston food event.

Leaving a high-flying job in consulting, Angela Lee Duckworth took a job teaching math to seventh graders in a New York public school. She quickly realized that IQ wasn't the only thing separating the successful students from those who struggled. Here, she explains her theory of "grit" as a predictor of success.
