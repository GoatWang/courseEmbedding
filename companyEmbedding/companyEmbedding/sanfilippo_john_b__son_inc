John B. Sanfilippo and Son, Inc. - Grocery.com
























































































  














John B. Sanfilippo and Son, Inc. 
John B. Sanfilippo and Son, Incorporated is a leading processor and distributor of peanuts and tree nuts in the country. The company is headquartered in Illinois, USA.
History
JBSS’s history began in 1922 when it was founded by father and son team Gaspare and John Sanfilippo as a small store that shelled pecans. Seven years later, the first Sanfilippo plant was built in Chicago.
In 1959, JBSS moved to a larger facility in Chicago. It was then that the company started to diversify its operations and started processing other types of nuts and developing new products. Nine years later, JBSS got its first customer for private label products.  That same year, the company’s oil-roasting and pecan-shelling operations were moved to Des Plaines, Illinois.
In 1974, the company was able to acquire the brand Evon’s®. This also marked the company’s entrance into the retail market. From 1980 to 1981, the company focused on becoming a complete-line nut supplier to its customers. During that time, it also completed a new production facility and corporate office in the area of Elk Grove Village.
In 1985, JBSS completed its acquisition of Midwest Nut and Seed Company. At the same time, it also entered in the bulk food industry. From 1986 to 1987, a new shelling, blanching and processing plant was constructed in the area of Bainbridge, Georgia. From 1990 to 1991, JBSS focused on its global market expansion. In the same period, the company also became public.
In the next three years, JBSS acquired several peanut processing companies, including Crane Walnut and Sunshine Nut Company. Also, the company constructed a facility in Garysburg, North Carolina. JBSS was also able to acquire the brands Fisher Nut® and Flavor Tree®. In 1996, the brand Fisher Chef’s Naturals® was recognized as the best tasting nut brand in the country. The recognition was given by the American Tasting Institute®.
In 2000, JBSS’ Fisher went into a partnership with the Chicago Cubs® and became the official peanut brand sold at Wrigley Field. In 2002 and 2003, the company launched new products under the Fisher label, Nature’s Nut Mix and Family Cans. In 2004, Fisher started a nationwide campaign to promote the health advantages of nuts. In relation to the campaign, the company introduced organic and unflavored nuts. The products were promoted as ideal for sprinkling over salads and other foods.
In 2006, Fisher launched its Fusions® and Natural Snacks line. Two years later, it launched its line of salad toppings, the Culinary Touch®. In 2009, the company launched more than twenty new products under the Fisher label. A year later, JBSS was able to acquire Orchard Valley Harvest.
Currently, the company processes and markets a variety of retail nut products, as well as raw nuts.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


      Some of the statements in this release are forward-looking. These 
      forward-looking statements may be generally identified by the use of 
      forward-looking words and phrases such as “will”, “intends”, “may”, 
      “believes”, “anticipates”, “should” and “expects” and are based on the 
      Company’s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and 
      involve risks and uncertainties. Consequently, the Company’s actual 
      results could differ materially. The Company undertakes no obligation to 
      update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, 
      whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors 
      that affect the subject of these statements, except where expressly 
      required to do so by law. Among the factors that could cause results to 
      differ materially from current expectations are: (i) the risks 
      associated with our vertically integrated model with respect to pecans, 
      peanuts and walnuts; (ii) sales activity for the Company’s products, 
      such as a decline in sales to one or more key customers, a decline in 
      sales of private brand products or changing consumer preferences; (iii) 
      changes in the availability and costs of raw materials and the impact of 
      fixed price commitments with customers; (iv) the ability to pass on 
      price increases to customers if commodity costs rise and the potential 
      for a negative impact on demand for, and sales of, our products from 
      price increases; (v) the ability to measure and estimate bulk inventory, 
      fluctuations in the value and quantity of the Company’s nut inventories 
      due to fluctuations in the market prices of nuts and bulk inventory 
      estimation adjustments, respectively; (vi) the Company’s ability to 
      appropriately respond to, or lessen the negative impact of, competitive 
      and pricing pressures; (vii) losses associated with product recalls, 
      product contamination, food labeling or other food safety issues, or the 
      potential for lost sales or product liability if customers lose 
      confidence in the safety of the Company’s products or in nuts or nut 
      products in general, or are harmed as a result of using the Company’s 
      products; (viii) the ability of the Company to retain key personnel; 
      (ix) the effect of the actions and decisions of the group that has the 
      majority of the voting power with regard to the Company’s outstanding 
      common equity (which may make a takeover or change in control more 
      difficult), including the effect of any agreements pursuant to which 
      such group has pledged a substantial amount of its securities of the 
      Company; (x) the potential negative impact of government regulations and 
      laws and regulations pertaining to food safety, such as the Food Safety 
      Modernization Act; (xi) uncertainty in economic conditions, including 
      the potential for economic downturn; (xii) the timing and occurrence (or 
      nonoccurrence) of other transactions and events which may be subject to 
      circumstances beyond the Company’s control; (xiii) the adverse effect of 
      labor unrest or disputes, litigation and/or legal settlements, including 
      potential unfavorable outcomes exceeding any amounts accrued; (xiv) 
      losses due to significant disruptions at any of our production or 
      processing facilities; (xv) the inability to implement our Strategic 
      Plan or realize efficiency measures, including controlling medical and 
      personnel costs; (xvi) technology disruptions or failures; (xvii) the 
      inability to protect the Company’s brand value, intellectual property or 
      avoid intellectual property disputes; (xviii) the Company’s ability to 
      manage successfully the price gap between its private brand products and 
      those of its branded competitors; and (xix) potential increased 
      industry-specific regulation pending the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration assessment of the risk of Salmonella contamination 
      associated with tree nuts.

John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. (NASDAQ: JBSS) (the “Company”) 
      today announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) declared a 
      special cash dividend (the “Special Dividend”) of $2.00 per share on all 
      issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock 
      of the Company. The Special Dividend will be in addition to a regular 
      annual cash dividend of $0.50 per share on all issued and outstanding 
      shares of Common Stock and Class A Common Stock of the Company, which 
      was also declared today (the “Annual Dividend”). The aggregate amount of 
      the Special Dividend and the Annual Dividend will be approximately $28.4 
      million.
    

      The Special Dividend and the Annual Dividend will be paid on August 15, 
      2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 2,

      “We are pleased to announce the $2.00 per share Special Dividend and our 
      first annual dividend of $0.50 per share pursuant to our Dividend 
      Policy,” stated Jeffrey T. Sanfilippo, Chairman and Chief Executive 
      Officer. “Our financial performance in the first three quarters of 
      fiscal 2017 has provided us the opportunity to return profits to our 
      stockholders through these dividends. These dividends, like our previous 
      dividends, further reinforces our goal of creating long-term stockholder 
      value through the responsible use of cash. These dividends would not be 
      possible without the hard work and dedication of all our employees,” Mr. 
      Sanfilippo concluded.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


      Some of the statements in this release are forward-looking. These 
      forward-looking statements may be generally identified by the use of 
      forward-looking words and phrases such as “will”, “intends”, “may”, 
      “believes”, “anticipates”, “should” and “expects” and are based on the 
      Company’s current expectations or beliefs concerning future events and 
      involve risks and uncertainties. Consequently, the Company’s actual 
      results could differ materially. The Company undertakes no obligation to 
      update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, 
      whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors 
      that affect the subject of these statements, except where expressly 
      required to do so by law. Among the factors that could cause results to 
      differ materially from current expectations are: (i) the risks 
      associated with our vertically integrated model with respect to pecans, 
      peanuts and walnuts; (ii) sales activity for the Company’s products, 
      such as a decline in sales to one or more key customers, a decline in 
      sales of private brand products or changing consumer preferences; (iii) 
      changes in the availability and costs of raw materials and the impact of 
      fixed price commitments with customers; (iv) the ability to pass on 
      price increases to customers if commodity costs rise and the potential 
      for a negative impact on demand for, and sales of, our products from 
      price increases; (v) the ability to measure and estimate bulk inventory, 
      fluctuations in the value and quantity of the Company’s nut inventories 
      due to fluctuations in the market prices of nuts and bulk inventory 
      estimation adjustments, respectively; (vi) the Company’s ability to 
      appropriately respond to, or lessen the negative impact of, competitive 
      and pricing pressures; (vii) losses associated with product recalls, 
      product contamination, food labeling or other food safety issues, or the 
      potential for lost sales or product liability if customers lose 
      confidence in the safety of the Company’s products or in nuts or nut 
      products in general, or are harmed as a result of using the Company’s 
      products; (viii) the ability of the Company to retain key personnel; 
      (ix) the effect of the actions and decisions of the group that has the 
      majority of the voting power with regard to the Company’s outstanding 
      common equity (which may make a takeover or change in control more 
      difficult), including the effect of any agreements pursuant to which 
      such group has pledged a substantial amount of its securities of the 
      Company; (x) the potential negative impact of government regulations and 
      laws and regulations pertaining to food safety, such as the Food Safety 
      Modernization Act; (xi) uncertainty in economic conditions, including 
      the potential for economic downturn; (xii) the timing and occurrence (or 
      nonoccurrence) of other transactions and events which may be subject to 
      circumstances beyond the Company’s control; (xiii) the adverse effect of 
      labor unrest or disputes, litigation and/or legal settlements, including 
      potential unfavorable outcomes exceeding any amounts accrued; (xiv) 
      losses due to significant disruptions at any of our production or 
      processing facilities; (xv) the inability to implement our Strategic 
      Plan or realize efficiency measures, including controlling medical and 
      personnel costs; (xvi) technology disruptions or failures; (xvii) the 
      inability to protect the Company’s brand value, intellectual property or 
      avoid intellectual property disputes; (xviii) the Company’s ability to 
      manage successfully the price gap between its private brand products and 
      those of its branded competitors; and (xix) potential increased 
      industry-specific regulation pending the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration assessment of the risk of Salmonella contamination 
      associated with tree nuts.

Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. Second Quarter EPS Increased by 5.6% to a Second Quarter Record $1.13 per Share Diluted; Board of Directors Adopts Annual Dividend PolicyBusiness WireFebruary 1, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareELGIN, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. (JBSS) (the “Company”) today announced operating results for its fiscal 2017 second quarter. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $12.9 million, or $1.13 per share diluted, compared to net income of $12.1 million, or $1.07 per share diluted, for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Net income for the first two quarters of fiscal 2017 was $23.1 million, or $2.03 per share diluted, compared to net income of $20.0 million, or $1.77 per share diluted, for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016.Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were $249.4 million compared to net sales of $279.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to significantly lower selling prices for almonds and walnuts. Sales volume, which is defined as pounds sold to customers, declined by 3.8% due to a decrease in sales volume in the commercial ingredients distribution channel. The sales volume decline in the commercial ingredients channel resulted from lower sales of peanuts to other peanut shellers, the loss of an almond butter customer and decreased sales of bulk inshell walnuts to international customers. Sales volume increased in the contract packaging distribution channel from increased sales of peanuts and trail mixes to existing customers.Sales volume increased in the consumer distribution channel primarily from increased sales of our Fisher recipe nuts and Orchard Valley Harvest branded products, while sales volume for private brand products was relatively unchanged. Sales volume for our branded products changed in the quarterly comparison as follows:  Fisher recipe nuts       14.8%     Fisher snack nuts     (12.3)%     Orchard Valley Harvest and Sunshine Country produce products     10.4%  The increase in sales volume for Fisher recipe nuts was driven primarily by a larger package size for walnuts, distribution gains with new customers and increased promotional activity. The decline in sales volume for Fisher snack nuts resulted from decreased display opportunities and lower promotional activity. The increase in sales volume for our produce brands resulted from a 43.4% increase in sales volume for our Orchard Valley Harvest brand due to new item introductions, which was partially offset by a decline in sales volume for Sunshine Country produce products due to lost distribution.For the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, net sales declined to $471.7 million from $504.8 million for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016. The decline in net sales in the year to date comparison was also primarily attributable to significantly lower selling prices for almonds and walnuts, which was offset in part by a 2.2% increase in sales volume. Sales volume increased in the consumer distribution channel from increased sales of Fisher recipe nuts, private brand snack nuts and Orchard Valley Harvest produce products. Sales volume increased in the contract packaging distribution channel primarily for the same reasons noted in the quarterly comparison. Sales volume declined in the commercial ingredients distribution channel also for the same reasons noted in the quarterly comparison.Gross profit decreased by $1.6 million, or 3.6%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in gross profit was mainly due to decreased sales volume. Gross profit margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 17.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 from 16.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in gross profit margin primarily resulted from lower commodity acquisition costs for almonds, which was partially offset by higher commodity acquisition costs for pecans and cashews. In the year to date comparison, gross profit increased by $1.6 million, or 2.1%, and gross profit margin increased to 16.9% for the first two quarters of fiscal 2017 from 15.5% for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016. The increases in gross profit and gross profit margin in the year to date comparison primarily resulted from lower commodity acquisition costs for almonds and increased sales volume.Total operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 9.5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 from 9.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Total operating expenses for the first two quarters of fiscal 2017 increased to 9.2% of net sales from 8.9% of net sales for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016. The increases in total operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales, in both the quarter and year to date comparisons were mainly due to a lower net sales base. Total operating expenses decreased by 6.6% in the quarterly comparison and by 2.7% in the year to date comparison primarily as a result of lower compensation and advertising expenses.Read MoreInterest expense was $0.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to $0.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Interest expense for the first two quarters of fiscal 2017 was $1.2 million compared to $1.7 million for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016. The decrease in interest expense in both comparisons was attributable primarily to lower debt levels.The reduction in income tax expense in the quarterly comparison resulted from the Company’s application of a recently adopted accounting standard relating to share-based compensation awards that vested during the current second quarter.The total value of inventories on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased by $2.6 million, or 1.4%, compared to the total value of inventories on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease in the total value of inventories on hand was primarily driven by lower costs of finished goods due to lower acquisition costs for walnuts and almonds. The weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dried fruit input stocks on hand at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2017 increased by 4.5% compared to the weighted average cost per pound at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in the weighted average cost per pound of raw nut and dried fruit input stocks was mainly due to higher acquisition costs for pecans and cashews, which were offset in part by declines in walnut, almond and peanut acquisition costs.On January 31, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) adopted a dividend policy under which it intends to pay an annual cash dividend on its Common Stock and Class A Common Stock. It is contemplated that this annual dividend would be declared around the conclusion of the Company’s fiscal year and paid in the first quarter of each fiscal year. One of the key factors that will be taken into account in determining the annual dividend amount (and whether any such dividend will be paid) will be the liquidity position of the Company, in particular the borrowing availability under our credit facility.We expect that the dividend paid under this policy in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018 will be at least equal to $0.50 per share. The Board will review the dividend policy regularly and any future annual or special dividends (whether such are paid and, if so, the amount and timing of payment) will be at the discretion of the Board, after taking into account a variety of factors, including the cash flows, borrowing availability under our credit facility, earnings and financial position of the Company. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, any dividends paid on our Common Stock must be equivalent to the dividends paid on our Class A Common Stock.“Net income and diluted earnings per share reached record levels for any second fiscal quarter,” stated Jeffrey T. Sanfilippo, Chief Executive Officer. “As was the case in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, sales volume growth for our Fisher recipe nut and produce brands continues to outpace sales volume growth for our private brand products,” Mr. Sanfilippo noted. “At retail, both our Fisher recipe nut and our Orchard Valley Harvest brands performed well in the quarterly comparison according to IRi market data. Fisher recipe nut pound volume increased by approximately 21%, while the total recipe nut category pound volume declined by approximately 4%. At the end of the current second quarter, Fisher recipe nut pound share rose to a record 30% according to IRi market data, continuing Fisher recipe’s position as the market share leader in recipe nuts. Total pound volume for our Orchard Valley Harvest and Sunshine Country produce brands increased by approximately 25%, while the total produce category pound volume only increased by approximately 10%,” Mr. Sanfilippo stated. “The sales volume decline for Fisher snack nuts occurred at retailers that do not report market data to IRi. At those retailers that do report market data to IRi, Fisher snack nut pound volume increased by approximately 35% from new distribution gains while the total snack nut category pound volume was relatively unchanged,” Mr. Sanfilippo stated. “We again saw meaningful sales volume growth in our contract packaging channel due to the efforts we made in assisting our customers as they launched new peanut and trail mix products and gained new distribution,” Mr. Sanfilippo added. “The sales volume decline in the commercial ingredients channel arose primarily as a result of carrying lower quantities of inshell walnuts to sell to international customers and lower quantities of farmer stock peanuts to sell to other peanut shellers compared to the quantities of these commodities that were available for sale in the second quarter of 2016. The decline in sales volume in the commercial ingredients channel was also attributable to the loss of an almond butter customer, however, we more than replaced that lost sales volume with strong volume growth for our branded and contract packaging products,” Mr. Sanfilippo stated.“In addition to record second quarter net income and diluted earnings per share, we are pleased to announce our new dividend policy,” stated Mr. Sanfilippo. “We believe that now is the time to begin the practice of paying an annual dividend to our stockholders. This dividend policy advances our goals of creating long-term stockholder value and expanding our stockholder base, and is supported by our strong financial performance. Of course, this would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees. In addition, our Board will continue to consider the declaration of special dividends around the time of each annual meeting of stockholders,” Mr. Sanfilippo concluded.The Company will host an investor conference call and webcast on Thursday, February 2, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern (9:00 a.m. Central) to discuss these results.

FAQ




Do nuts have cholesterol?
No. Nuts are derived from plants. Therefore, they do not contain cholesterol. Additionally, most nuts are very low in saturated fat. They mainly contain polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids.
Research about the possible harms and benefits of dietary fat is always evolving. And a growing body of research suggests that when it comes to dietary fat, you should focus on eating healthy fats and avoiding unhealthy fats.
Saturated fat. This is a type of fat that comes mainly from animal sources of food. Saturated fat raises total blood cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, which can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease.
The types of potentially helpful dietary fat are mostly unsaturated.
Monounsaturated fatty acids. This is a type of fat found in a variety of foods and oils. Studies show that eating foods rich in monounsaturated fatty acids improves blood cholesterol levels, which can decrease your risk of heart disease.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids. This is a type of fat found mostly in plant-based foods and oils. Evidence shows that eating foods rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids improves blood cholesterol levels, which can decrease your risk of heart disease.

What is the best way to store nuts?
SNACK NUTS: Store nuts in a cool and dry area. You can also refrigerate them to help extend their freshness.
RECIPE NUTS: Store nuts in a cold and dry area. If you intend to keep the nuts for a long period of time, you can freeze them. After opening, keep the nuts in an airtight container.
What is the difference between raw and natural?
Nothing. They are the same.
Are nuts roasted in cooking oils that contain transfats?
No, our nuts are roasted in cottonseed, peanut and/or sunflower oil.
Are there any nutritional changes as a result of pasteurization?
No.
What is the difference between nuts and peanuts?
A botanical definition of a nut is a fruit with a hard, dry shell that needs to be cracked open to release the kernel. Nuts grow on trees. However, peanuts are a legume and are grown underground.
Can you tell me the nutritional values of nuts?
Go to our About Nuts page and click on any nut type for nutritional values.
Are your packages recyclable? 
Although some of our packages are made with plant-based film, our stand-up, re-sealable bags are not recyclable due to the material we use to help maintain product freshness. We also carry a wide variety of snacking products packaged in 100% recyclable plastic cans and jars.
As a company, we employ many procedures aiming to protect the environment in multiple ways. We stay committed by conserving energy and focusing on waste and energy reduction throughout all our facilities.
Are your products gluten free? 
John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. (JBSS) recognizes sources of gluten as defined by the FDA: wheat, rye, barley and their crossbred hybrids like triticale. Although some of our products do not contain gluten they may be produced on the same lines as our products that do contain gluten. Our production lines are cleaned between batches; some cross contamination may exist. Individuals who are extremely sensitive may be affected.
 Does your facility have any allergens?
Allergens present in our facilities are as follows: peanuts, tree nuts, milk, soy, wheat and egg.
Are your products NON-GMO? 
Peanuts, tree nuts and sunflower kernels, raw, dry roasted or oil roasted with or without salt (and contain no other ingredients) sold by John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. do not contain genetically engineered DNA and/or the proteins derived from genetically engineered DNA.
Products with seasoning or additional ingredients may or may not contain GMO.
What processes do you use to reduce the risk of the presence of harmful pathogens in your products?
Our nut products are treated or pasteurized before being sold to consumers in North America to provide consumers with a safe and quality product. Several methods are commonly used in the processing of nuts which include roasting, steaming and propylene oxide (PPO). The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has approved PPO treatment as an acceptable form of pasteurization for almonds. PPO is a surface treatment which has been approved for use on foods since 1958, and is widely used for a variety of foods such as other nuts, cocoa powder and spices.
Where is JBSS located?
Our facility locations can be found on our Facilities & Capabilities page. You can also find our Corporate Office and Fisher Nuts Store information on our Contact page.

ABOUT NUTS




We deliver
UNMATCHED NUT QUALITY
At John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. we live for nuts. Since 1922, we have been dedicated to procuring, processing and packaging. It is our commitment to consistently deliver the highest quality products to our customer and consumer base. We pride ourselves on knowing everything there is to know about nuts. Check out our links below to discover even more!

Qualified Health Claim: Nuts and Coronary Heart Disease
Scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts (such as almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachio nuts and walnuts) as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease (See nutrition information for fat content).

Nuts grow & mature at different times throughout the year.
NUT HARVEST TIMELINE




Since nuts are an agricultural product, they are susceptible to natural occurrences such as droughts or cold weather. Variations in the tonnage of nuts available to harvest have an impact on their price. Using the Nut Harvest Timeline, we closely monitor the progress of every nut from the time of its gestation to harvest. This helps us plan and procure the best product to process and meet the requirements of our diverse customer base.
