Woodstock is in Cherokee County and is noted as one of the fastest growing cities in the state of Georgia. The area is home to nearly 20,000 residents and is accessible by Interstate 575 and State Highway 92. While the majority of residents commute nearly 30 miles to Atlanta daily for employment, the city is poised for substantial commercial development. Newly established industrial parks, shopping centers and the rise in high-tech firms in the area are all promising developments for this bustling suburb. 
Woodstock residents will enjoy shopping at nearby Town Center Mall. The area features an abundance of shopping, dining and entertainment options. Families will enjoy the nearby recreational facilities where golfing, boating, fishing and other water sports are popular. 
Attractions in Woodstock include the Golf Club at Bradshaw Farm and the Dixie Speedway. The Golf Club at Bradshaw Farm is said to be one of the most challenging courses in the area. It features a 27-hole par 72 layout, plays up to 6,838 yards and features dramatic elevation changes, including 100-foot drop offs. Woodstock's Dixie Speedway hosts weekly stock car racing along with special events including Monster Truck Nationals and Demolition Derbies.
Students will attend schools in the Cherokee County Public Schools system, one of the fastest growing districts in the state. Competitive private schools are convenient to the area and a number of impressive colleges and universities are nearby as well. 
Woodstock is booming with great deals. Whether you're interested in a luxury estate on the golf course, or a charming cottage perfect for a first time homebuyer, Woodstock delivers. New construction is in abundance and stunning new developments are quickly sprouting all over this charming town. While many magnificent luxury homes in the area are valued well over $1 million, homes in the area start in the low $100s.

        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to

Woodstock is in Cherokee County and is noted as one of the fastest growing cities in the state of Georgia. The area is home to nearly 20,000 residents and is accessible by Interstate 575 and State Highway 92. While the majority of residents commute nearly 30 miles to Atlanta daily for employment, the city is poised for substantial commercial development. Newly established industrial parks, shopping centers and the rise in high-tech firms in the area are all promising developments for this bustling suburb. 
Woodstock residents will enjoy shopping at nearby Town Center Mall. The area features an abundance of shopping, dining and entertainment options. Families will enjoy the nearby recreational facilities where golfing, boating, fishing and other water sports are popular. 
Attractions in Woodstock include the Golf Club at Bradshaw Farm and the Dixie Speedway. The Golf Club at Bradshaw Farm is said to be one of the most challenging courses in the area. It features a 27-hole par 72 layout, plays up to 6,838 yards and features dramatic elevation changes, including 100-foot drop offs. Woodstock's Dixie Speedway hosts weekly stock car racing along with special events including Monster Truck Nationals and Demolition Derbies.
Students will attend schools in the Cherokee County Public Schools system, one of the fastest growing districts in the state. Competitive private schools are convenient to the area and a number of impressive colleges and universities are nearby as well. 
Woodstock is booming with great deals. Whether you're interested in a luxury estate on the golf course, or a charming cottage perfect for a first time homebuyer, Woodstock delivers.
