By Michael S. Rosenwald
Washington Post Staff Writer

Saturday, October 22, 2005




John W. Marriott III said yesterday that he is leaving the company that his family built from a Washington, D.C., root beer stand into a global food and hotel empire, the apparent start of a transition away from day-to-day family control of one of the region's most prominent corporations.



As the middle son of Marriott International's chairman and chief executive J.W. "Bill" Marriott Jr., he had been a leading candidate to take over the firm when his father, 73, retires. But word that he will leave the Bethesda company in January seemed to confirm what many Marriott-watchers have long suspected: Executive control of the world's largest hotel chain will pass from the family that built the company.


"This clearly indicates that someone other than a family member will likely be the next chief executive," said William C. Marks, an analyst with JMP Securities. The focus now, he said, is on two longtime executives: Arne M. Sorenson, the chief financial officer, and William J. Shaw, the president.


Marriott's deep roots in the region's business community date back to when Washington was mostly a one-company town -- a government town. Though that has largely changed through the years, with dozens of high-tech startups and government contractors producing a bevy of millionaires, Marriott's presence has been a constant, with the family playing major roles in the civic and philanthropic worlds.


Bill Marriott has been a member of the Federal City Council, an influential civic organization focused on development in the District, for decades. The company has supported local causes such as the Marriott Hospitality Public Charter High School, a District public school that prepares high school students for careers in the hotel business. Sorenson also has ties to Washington; before joining Marriott, he was a Washington-based partner with law firm Latham & Watkins.


John W. Marriott III, 44, joined the family business in 1976, four years after his father took over as chief executive. As executive vice president of lodging, he had been credited recently with reviving the firm's 14 different brands -- from the moderately priced Fairfield Inn to the extravagant Ritz-Carlton.


While the announcement appears to take John Marriott out of the running to control the company, he was promoted to vice chairman of the board of directors, suggesting the family would continue to wield influence in the firm's operations. The family controls 23 percent of company stock.


John Marriott outranked his brothers Stephen and David on the corporate ladder in the company their grandparents founded in 1927 on 14th Street NW. The root beer stand led to the Hot Shoppes restaurant chain, followed by Roy Rogers and Big Boy. The family opened their first hotel in Arlington in 1957.


Today the company has 133,000 employees -- 13,165 locally -- and more than $10 billion a year in revenue. With that kind of money at stake, particularly in a family-run business, questions of succession become complicated. The media conglomerate Murdoch family is wrestling with similar issues, with Rupert Murdoch's oldest son Lachlan recently leaving the family business.


Though Bill Marriott and the company strongly maintain that he has no plans to step aside anytime soon, that hasn't stopped speculation both inside and outside of the firm about who will one day take over. The focus, in part, had naturally been on a family member, which is not surprising to anyone familiar with Bill Marriott's persona as a folksy, devout Mormon, a tough businessman who also cares deeply about family life and values.


Though John Marriott is known to be more introverted than his father, he is clearly trusted with the family's fortune. He founded JWM Family Enterprises, a private investment partnership with more than $600 million in assets. He will become the organization's chief executive.


John Marriott's position as a possible successor to his father was largely a function of family circumstances. His brother David, senior vice president of global and field sales, is only 32 years old and not fully groomed as a top executive. His older brother Stephen, a senior vice president of culture and special events, has a hearing and vision impairment that developed when he was a teenager and has progressed.


Their sister Debbie does not work in the business, though her husband, Ron Harrison, is in charge of Canadian operations.


John Marriott and his father were not available for comment yesterday, company officials said. However, Charlotte Sterling, executive vice president of communications, said that the company's board has "always felt very strongly that the right person should lead the company, whether it's a Marriott or not."

Marriott and John Marriott sit in pajamas and robes in 2004. (AP Photo/ Matt Houston, File)    By Adam Bernstein  By Adam Bernstein   June 24, 2013     Stephen Marriott began using hearing aids in ninth grade, and his father tried to reassure him that the device was no different than a set of eyeglasses.  His vision slowly worsened, too. By his early 20s, after completing a Mormon mission in British Columbia and entering graduate business school, Mr. Marriott could barely make out his professor’s notes on the chalkboard. His condition was diagnosed years later as mitochondrial disease, a rare muscular disorder. It left him with a stutter and spasms in his hands that prevented him from mastering Braille. It has no cure. “My dad likes to fix things fast,” Mr. Marriott told Washingtonian magazine a few years ago. “I think he got a little frustrated because he wanted to fix my eyes and my ears, and he didn’t know how to do it. None of us know how to do it yet.” For decades, his father presided over the Marriott International business empire, which grew from a root beer stand in Washington during the Roaring Twenties to a sprawling, multibillion-dollar company that includes hotel management, real estate operations, airplane catering and the Big Boy and Roy Rogers fast-food chains, among other enterprises. Stephen Marriott, who died June 23 at age 54, was part of the close-knit Marriott family management. Despite his physical barriers, he rose through the company starting from the lowest rungs.  At 16, he was a cook at a Roy Rogers. Later, as a hotel manager, he went by Stephen Garff — his middle name — to shield himself from the notoriety of his family connections. By the early 1990s, he was director of resort marketing at the company’s corporate headquarters in Bethesda.  He was mentioned as a potential heir in running the company, but his health problems deepened. In 2011, his father, J.W. “Bill” Marriott Jr., the son of the company founder, retired as Marriott International chief executive and was succeeded by Arne Sorenson, the president and chief operating officer. Since 2006, Stephen Marriott has held the title of executive vice president for culture, in which he helped employees with training and job promotion opportunities. He relied on an assistant to read his mail, and he used a voice-activated computer system to type correspondence. He memorized his speeches.  He made his presence known at Marriott properties. He told Washingtonian that a friend was once guiding him through a hotel lobby when he sensed his escort pause, reach down and pick up trash — the “Marriott bend,” he called it. He immediately called the general manager to report litter. Stephen Garff Marriott was born in Washington on April 15, 1959, and grew up in Chevy Chase. He graduated in 1977 from the private St. Albans School in the District and in 1983 from Brigham Young University in Utah. He received a master’s degree in business administration from Arizona State University in 1985. Since 1996, he chaired the Marriott Business Councils worldwide, which promote company culture, community service and public policy. In May, he received the council’s top award, which has been named in his honor. He served on boards representing people with disabilities, including the American Foundation for the Blind. He also was an Eagle Scout and served on the National Capital Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America         1 of 109       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Skip Ad   ×           Notable deaths of 2013      View Photos   A look at those who have died this year.

He was 65. Jason Merritt/Getty Images  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.           Survivors include his wife of 32 years, Juliana Baughman Marriott of Potomac; three children, S. Blake Marriott of Boston and Jennifer Jackson and Ashley Samuelian, both of Orange County, Calif.; his parents, Bill and Donna Marriott of Bethesda; two brothers, John W. Marriott III and David Marriott, both of Potomac; a sister, Deborah Harrison of Potomac; and five grandchildren. Stephen Marriott died at his home in Potomac, said his father, who is now Marriott International executive chairman. The cause was complications from mitochondrial disease. He said his son was properly diagnosed about 20 years ago and in recent years had taken an experimental drug that likely helped prolong his life. He pulled back only slightly from a full workload. And he relied heavily on a disciplined memory for work and other activities. “He taught Sunday school classes in his 40s and, one day, he wrote the names on the board of the 12 tribes of Israel from memory,” Bill Marriott said. “I asked him where he remembered that from, and he said he learned it at St. Albans 20 years earlier.”             Comments           Share on FacebookShare       Share on TwitterTweet     Share via Email                         Show Comments       Discussion Policy     Comments       SuperFan Badge SuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.
