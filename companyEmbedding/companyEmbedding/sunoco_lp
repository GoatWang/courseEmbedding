Sunoco LP’s President and CEO, Bob Owens, to RetireJoe Kim named president and COO
Greg Lindenberg

Industry News & Analysis>

Corporate News










June 23, 2017DALLAS -- Robert "Bob" Owens, president and CEO of 
Sunoco LP, is retiring as of Dec. 31 after more than 20 years with Sunoco and its predecessors. Effective immediately, Joe Kim, who has held the position of executive vice president and chief development officer for Sunoco since 2015, has been appointed president and COO.Dallas-based Sunoco LP is a master limited partnership (MLP) that operates 1,355 convenience stores and retail fuel sites and distributes motor fuel to 7,825 c-stores, independent dealers, commercial customers and distributors located in 30 states.
Sunoco is selling approximately 1,100 company-operates sites to
7-Eleven Inc. in 18 states—approximately 110 in Florida, 450 in New York and 550 in Texas—for $3.3 billion, the companies said in April. Irving, Texas-based 7-Eleven is also acquiring the trademarks and intellectual property of the Stripes c-store brand and the Laredo Taco Company foodservice brand, which Sunoco gained when it
purchased Susser Holdings Corp. for about $1.9 billion in 2015.Owens, who joined Sunoco Inc. in 1997, has held the position of president and CEO since 2012, and he will continue as CEO until his retirement and will then serve as a consultant to the partnership through 2019. Sunoco executives Cynthia Archer (pictured, bottom left), executive vice president and chief marketing officer, and Boyd Foster (bottom right), executive vice president of manufacturing and distribution, are also retiring effective Dec. 31.
“We thank Bob for his many years of strategic leadership, which has resulted in an impressive list of accomplishments for both the employees and the unitholders of Sunoco and wish him and his family the best,” said Kelcy Warren, chairman of Dallas-based 
Energy Transfer Equity, the entity that owns the general partner of Sunoco. “While we are sad to see Bob go, we are excited for the next generation of leadership at Sunoco to take on larger roles. Joe is an exceptionally talented leader, and he has played a significant role in the planned transformation of the partnership from a retail-based business into a premier nationwide fuel supplier.”“Additionally, the appointment of Joe as president and COO and Bob continuing as CEO through year-end will ensure an orderly transition as we move through the divestment of our retail operations during the coming months,” said Warren.Owens (top left) joined Sunoco as senior vice president of marketing, where he was responsible for Sunoco’s retail network, wholesale marketing and transportation operations and commercial supply and trading activities for crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals.Prior to joining Sunoco, he held executive positions with Ultramar Diamond Shamrock, Amerada Hess and Mobil Oil.Kim (top right) has been responsible for Sunoco LP’s strategic development and planning, overseeing both business development and Sunoco’s real-estate portfolio. Prior to joining Sunoco, he held various executive positions, including COO of Pizza Hut and senior vice president of retail strategy and growth for Valero Energy. He began his career with Arthur Andersen.Related Topics:

Investor Relations




	Sunoco LP is a growth-oriented master limited partnership (MLP) that distributes motor fuel to approximately 6,800 convenience stores, independent dealers, commercial customers and distributors. We also operate approximately 1,340 C-stores and retail fuel sites. Common units are traded on the NYSE under the symbol SUN. Sunoco LP is managed by Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (NYSE: ETE), which owns its General Partner, all of its incentive distribution rights and a 2% LP interest in SUN. Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE: ETP) owns a 46% LP interest in SUN. 


Our 125-year-old Sunoco fuel brand and expertise in supply, trading and marketing, combined with our successful regional convenience store brands like Texas-based Stripes,® with its merchandising expertise, make Sunoco LP one of the largest and most diversified fuel distribution and marketing platforms in the U.S.  We supply fuel to customers in 30 U.S. states.
We strive to deliver market-leading distribution growth over the long term.  Our diverse portfolio of assets in attractive, high-growth markets generates a stable stream of distributable cash flows with significant upside potential through organic growth and opportunistic acquisitions.  This provides a strong platform that we believe has the potential to drive unitholder value over the long term.
Sunoco LP was formed by ETP in 2014 with the purchase of Susser Petroleum Partners LP, SUN’s predecessor. SUN experienced transformational growth through the subsequent dropdown of the legacy wholesale and retail assets of Sunoco Inc., retail assets of Susser Holdings Corporation, and from subsequent acquisitions, including Aloha Petroleum.

Our Businesses





Sunoco LP (NYSE: SUN) is a growth-oriented master limited partnership (MLP) that operates one of the leading wholesale fuel distribution and retail marketing platforms in the U.S., with tremendous scale and diversity of supply and geography.
Wholesale Fuel Distribution


We distribute Sunoco-branded motor fuel to 6,800 convenience stores, independent dealers, commercial customers and distributors -- including approximately 1,340 C-stores and retail fuel sites operated by SUN.  Our operations span 30 states mainly east of the Mississippi River, from Maine to Florida and west to Wisconsin and New Mexico.
Sunoco is also the world’s largest manufacturer and marketer of racing fuels, as well as the official fuel of NASCAR and an Indy Car sponsor.
Convenience Stores


Our Stripes® convenience store chain operates approximately 725 stores in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.  Restaurant service is available in approximately 440 of our stores, mostly under the proprietary Laredo Taco Company® brand, which serves hot, freshly made Mexican food. This highly successful restaurant concept is an important driver of both traffic and margins in our stores. 


The partnership plans to build 35 to 40 “new to industry” Stripes stores this year in high-growth Texas communities.  Laredo Taco Company restaurants are also being introduced in Sunoco LP’s other retail brand locations in select markets in the Eastern U.S.


We also operate approximately 440 convenience stores in the East and Southeast primarily under the APlus brand. These stores are located in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida.

Approximately 125 retail stores in high-growth markets in Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, Washington, D.C., and Maryland carry the MACS and Tigermarket brands.


In Hawaii, through our Aloha Petroleum subsidiary, Sunoco LP is the largest independent gasoline marketer and one of the largest convenience store operators on the islands, with an extensive wholesale fuel distribution network and six fuel storage terminals. 


Aloha markets through approximately 100 Shell, Aloha, and Mahalo branded fuel stations, about half of which are company operated, and 50 Aloha Island Mart convenience stores.

Sunoco LP Streamlines Its Source-to-Settle Process
MLP looks to reduce spend and gain efficiency.

February 10, 2016, 04:05 pm



 



DALLAS — Sunoco LP will deploy SciQuest’s source-to-settle technology suite to replace its current procurement tools and redefine its sourcing process.
According to SciQuest, Sunoco recognized the need to evaluate its source-to-settle process to reduce spend and gain efficiency throughout the company. The master limited partnership (MLP) and convenience store retailer determined there was an opportunity to standardize onboard, buy, pay and source functions under a single platform to help gain efficiencies in the organization.
Dallas-based Sunoco will deploy SciQuest’s entire suite of solutions, including:

Spend Radar to conduct the comprehensive, accurate analysis necessary to drive and measure cost savings;
Sourcing Director to expand control and management of the sourcing process;
Total Supplier Manager to achieve a reduction in risk exposure brought by suppliers, a greater depth of and visibility into supplier data, and consistent and accurate supplier data for supporting sourcing and procurement strategies;
Total Contract Manager to enable optimization and visibility of the entire contract lifecycle, using a single repository for all vendor contracts;
Spend Director to transform a manual and labor-intensive procurement process into a center of excellence, delivering significant cost savings and efficiencies, and automate the procure-to-pay process; and
Accounts Payable Director to eliminate tedious and error-prone manual processes, free up valuable resources and present an opportunity to make a significant impact on the organization’s bottom line.

“Sunoco is at the cutting-edge of many companies today because it views procurement as a strategic imperative that will help the organization grow in the coming years,” said Stephen Wiehe, president and CEO of SciQuest. “The company will not only gain greater insight into the impact of its current spend, but it will also be able to use this detailed information to help make strategic decisions about how to grow and expand.”
Morrisville, N.C.-based SciQuest is a provider of spend management solutions.
Sunoco LP operates more than 850 convenience stores under the Sunoco, APlus, Stripes, Mid-Atlantic Convenience Stores and Aloha Petroleum brand names.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!
