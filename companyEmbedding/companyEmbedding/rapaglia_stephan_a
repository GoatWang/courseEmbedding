Biographical Information[edit]
Stephan Rapaglia has been a player, manager and coach in baseball in a career that has taken him to four different countries.
Rapaglia grew up in Rye, NY after having been born in Germany. He spent 4 years at Amherst College, posting a record around 21-8. He began his post-college career in 1992 with the Houston Astros chain after being signed as an undrafted free agent. He was 0-1 with 3 saves and a 1.00 ERA for the GCL Astros, allowing 3 hits in 9 innings while fanning 11. He was promoted to the Auburn Astros, where he was 5-3 with a save and a 3.62 ERA in 20 games.
Stephan then moved to Hoofdklasse, where he had a 2.72 ERA for Neptunus and helped them take a title; he was among the league leaders in ERA. Returning to the US with the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs, he was 4-0 with a 1.01 ERA in 1995. He went 4-3 with a save and a 3.17 ERA in 1996, finishing 9th in the league in ERA. In 1997, he had a 1-2, 4.91 record for the Diamond Dogs. In 1998, Rapaglia managed the Johnstown Johnnies to a 34-43 record in the Frontier League.
Rapaglia was an assistant coach with Iona College from 1998-2000; the last year, the team had three pitchers who went pro, two of whom went to Organized Baseball. In 2001, he was a player-head coach for the Tübingen Hawks in his birthplace of Tübingen in Germany. He hit .300, led the league in saves and almost led in ERA. He was 1-0 with 2 saves and a 2.84 ERA in 2002 and 0-1 with a save and a 2.57 ERA in 2003.  
In 2004, Stephan was appointed manager of the British national team. He would lead them to a Silver Medal in the 2007 European Championship and the second round of the 2009 Baseball World Cup.
Rapaglia is a real estate lawyer in Greenwich, CT, when not managing the British national team.

Urstadt Biddle Properties Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying And 4.31% Yield (UBA)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.
