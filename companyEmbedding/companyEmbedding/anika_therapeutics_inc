	Headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts, Anika Therapeutics, Inc. develops, manufactures and commercializes therapeutic products for tissue protection, healing and repair. Our proprietary technology is based on hyaluronic acid (HA), a naturally occurring, biocompatible polymer found throughout the body that is essential to joint health and tissue function. Anika’s products range from orthopedic/joint health solutions led by Orthovisc® and Monovisc®; our multi- and single-injection treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee, to surgical aids in the ophthalmic and anti-adhesion fields. The company also offers aesthetic dermal fillers for the correction of facial wrinkles. Anika’s Italian subsidiary, Anika Therapeutics S.r.l., provides a complementary product and technology portfolio comprised of HA-based products in the orthopedics/joint health, advanced wound care and ear, nose and throat fields. Anika’s technology portfolio, including Anika Therapeutics S.r.l.’s subsidiary’s regenerative tissue technology, advances the company’s vision to offer therapeutic products that go beyond pain management to protect and restore damaged tissue. The company’s approach has enabled Anika to deliver long-term shareholder value by providing profitability and positive cash-flow, two rare characteristics for an entrepreneurial small-cap company that Anika intends to retain as it grows in the industry.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
