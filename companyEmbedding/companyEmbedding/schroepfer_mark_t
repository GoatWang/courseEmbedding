SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS.
GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK
PARTICIPATION MATTERS


                  Awful class. Tries to teach you how to read and play music spends 30 minutes on each and then you are quizzed the next day. Mark you down on participation for anything: Tardiness, using laptop to take notes, leaving early, leaning on desk etc. Open notes and book is nice but doesn't make a difference when you have only 30 minutes to take quiz.

                  Readings for every class aren't that important-class is all lecture based and note-taking from a powerpoint. Class can get long but prof is passionate about the subject and you won't be bored if you are interested too. Open note tests with one 10 page research paper.

                  Very passionate and made the class interesting. Super easy except a long paper (which I think most students did well on). I would definitely recommend him!

                  LOTS OF NOTES!! But you can use them on the tests and final, and if you take all the notes from the powerpoint you will do great!Attendance is mandatory, missing even one class drops you. You have one really hard 3000 word paper to write, with really no direction. But he grades fairly easy so its not a big deal. Very interesting class! Recommend!

                  The class requires a lot of note taking but you can use your notes on the quizzes.  One ten page paper that requires a bit of work but he is willing to help you and isn't too harsh of a grader.  He is very passionate about music and is by far the nicest professor I have had.

                  A LOT of note taking...A lot of the topics are boring unless you love super old music.  You are assigned a giant research-like paper and he gives almost no direction for exactly how to write it.  Do not take this class unless you are really good at music!

                  Lots of note taking. 2 quizzes and a final that are open note and book - pretty easy. A 10 page paper that is a little hard but he is more than willing to help you out so it is manageable. He teaches off slides and shows lots of video clips. Sometimes he even brings in his guitar and rocks out. Great guy, great class.

                  He is a nice guy, but the class is a ridiculous amount of work for just a fine arts class. Four super tough quizzes that are open book and note, but people still fail. One ten page paper, that?s misguided- he doesn?t help you with any of it, finding a topic for it is impossible.  Honestly I don?t recommend taking this class unless you?re desperate.

                  Great class, he teaches off of DVD slides and has lots of clips and movies in class.  Three in class exams that are open note and open book.  Final project that is really tough and graded tough as well.  Attendance in mandatory which sucks if you have this class at 8 in the morning.  This class is work but if you put it an A effort he'll give an A
