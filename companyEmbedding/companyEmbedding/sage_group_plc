 60-day risk-free guarantee

There's no risk with Sage 50c. If for any reason you're not satisfied within 60 days, we'll refund your money.1
Buy Now









If within 60 days of purchase, you are not 100% convinced that Sage 50 is the best accounting program for your business, we will refund your money (less any rebate you have received from the purchase). For first-time customers only.
Minimum one-year commitment required. Valid credit card and Internet access required to activate and maintain support and services.  To ensure continuous service, your Sage Business Care plan is an automatically renewing plan, and you will be charged up to a week prior to your renewal date. The subscription plan is an annual subscription with a lease to the software license; therefore, you can only use the software while you are on the plan. You may terminate your plan with at least ten days’ notice prior to your renewal date and not be charged for the renewal; however, if you terminate your subscription plan or if your subscription payment is not received, you will have read-only access to your data, and full program functionality will not be restored until you have brought your account current. The subscription plan requires that you be on the most current version of the software to continue your subscription.
Sage Drive is only available to customers on the latest release of Sage 50c Accounting and requires a computer with Internet Explorer 10, Firefox, or Chrome and a high-speed Internet connection. Sage 50 data may be accessed from more than one device at a time by one individual each, however only one has full access while the others have read only access, and there are limits as to the amount of data that can be accessed. Data access is subject to Internet provider network availability and occasional downtime due to system and server maintenance.

History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]
Operations[edit]
Founded and headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the company initially grew organically, but more recently has grown primarily through acquisitions. In 2004 the company's new headquarters was completed in the Great Park area of Newcastle upon Tyne; the company was previously located at Benton Park House. It now operates worldwide. The company's US headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia, the Canadian headquarters are in Richmond, British Columbia, the Africa, Middle East & Australia headquarters are in Johannesburg, South Africa and the French and Continental European headquarters are in Paris, France. Sage has 6.1 million customers and 13,400 employees across the world. Key industry focus includes: Healthcare; HR & Payroll; Construction/ Real-Estate; Transport/ Distribution; Payment Processing; Accountancy; Not-for-Profit; Manufacturing; Retail; Automotive Distribution.[22]

History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]
Operations[edit]
Founded and headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the company initially grew organically, but more recently has grown primarily through acquisitions. In 2004 the company's new headquarters was completed in the Great Park area of Newcastle upon Tyne; the company was previously located at Benton Park House. It now operates worldwide. The company's US headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia, the Canadian headquarters are in Richmond, British Columbia, the Africa, Middle East & Australia headquarters are in Johannesburg, South Africa and the French and Continental European headquarters are in Paris, France. Sage has 6.1 million customers and 13,400 employees across the world. Key industry focus includes: Healthcare; HR & Payroll; Construction/ Real-Estate; Transport/ Distribution; Payment Processing; Accountancy; Not-for-Profit; Manufacturing; Retail; Automotive Distribution.[22]

History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]
Operations[edit]
Founded and headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the company initially grew organically, but more recently has grown primarily through acquisitions. In 2004 the company's new headquarters was completed in the Great Park area of Newcastle upon Tyne; the company was previously located at Benton Park House. It now operates worldwide. The company's US headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia, the Canadian headquarters are in Richmond, British Columbia, the Africa, Middle East & Australia headquarters are in Johannesburg, South Africa and the French and Continental European headquarters are in Paris, France. Sage has 6.1 million customers and 13,400 employees across the world. Key industry focus includes: Healthcare; HR & Payroll; Construction/ Real-Estate; Transport/ Distribution; Payment Processing; Accountancy; Not-for-Profit; Manufacturing; Retail; Automotive Distribution.[22]

History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]
Operations[edit]
Founded and headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the company initially grew organically, but more recently has grown primarily through acquisitions. In 2004 the company's new headquarters was completed in the Great Park area of Newcastle upon Tyne; the company was previously located at Benton Park House. It now operates worldwide. The company's US headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia, the Canadian headquarters are in Richmond, British Columbia, the Africa, Middle East & Australia headquarters are in Johannesburg, South Africa and the French and Continental European headquarters are in Paris, France. Sage has 6.1 million customers and 13,400 employees across the world.

History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]
Operations[edit]
Founded and headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the company initially grew organically, but more recently has grown primarily through acquisitions. In 2004 the company's new headquarters was completed in the Great Park area of Newcastle upon Tyne; the company was previously located at Benton Park House. It now operates worldwide. The company's US headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia, the Canadian headquarters are in Richmond, British Columbia, the Africa, Middle East & Australia headquarters are in Johannesburg, South Africa and the French and Continental European headquarters are in Paris, France. Sage has 6.1 million customers and 13,400 employees across the world. Key industry focus includes: Healthcare; HR & Payroll; Construction/ Real-Estate; Transport/ Distribution; Payment Processing; Accountancy; Not-for-Profit; Manufacturing; Retail; Automotive Distribution.[22]

Style Scores:



D Value | A Growth | B Momentum | B VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

					Objects:

					Isolate data and create logic components to greatly improve development efficiency,

					maintainability and reliability.

					Linked Subroutines:

					Specify that multiple subroutines should use the same Objects.  Maybe you’ve

					got an initialization routine you’d like in one subroutine, and a process you want in another.  

					They can share an object, so you don’t have to pass data between the two.




					View your data and create operator controls with

					Awesome, Free HMI




					We’re serious about delivering the easiest to use, most productive PLC software.

					We could go on about our features, but seeing is believing, so Check out our vBuilder page,

vFactory page or Download vBuilder and vFactory. They're

					FREE




					Meet Branch








					Expansion has a vLink input port instead of USB. 

					Expansions are otherwise physically identical to Branch Main. 

					Your Sensors and Actuators are Branched Out, 

					Your PLC Should Branch With Them! 







					Branch's unique structure beats backplane and brick systems 

					at getting IO where it’s need, helping you run shorter wires and keep an organized system 




					Smarter IO

					Expansion units have full PLC processing power and memory.




					vBuilder’s power shines with Branch 

					Put subroutines inside of IO units to focus processing where it’s most needed. 

					Debug your entire Branch system as a unit.  No need to debug one processor at a time. 

					Lets you view real-time data for your entire system. 













					PLC programming should be fun! 

					We’ve got engaging tutorials to get you up to speed on our PLCs, and more are on the way. 

					Whether you’re new to PLCs, or just new to us, we want your learning experience to be enjoyable. 

					The tutorials aren’t boring or difficult to follow, we promise. 

					FREE Connector Tool 

					For a limited time only, we’re giving away a FREE connector tool with every Order!

History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]

Founded and headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the company initially grew organically, but more recently has grown primarily through acquisitions.

History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]
Operations[edit]
Founded and headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the company initially grew organically, but more recently has grown primarily through acquisitions. In 2004 the company's new headquarters was completed in the Great Park area of Newcastle upon Tyne; the company was previously located at Benton Park House. It now operates worldwide. The company's US headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia, the Canadian headquarters are in Richmond, British Columbia, the Africa, Middle East & Australia headquarters are in Johannesburg, South Africa and the French and Continental European headquarters are in Paris, France.

History[edit]
1981 to 2000[edit]
The Company was founded by David Goldman, Paul Muller and Graham Wylie in 1981 in Newcastle, to develop estimating and accounting software for small businesses.[5]
A student at Newcastle University, Graham Wylie, took a summer job with an accountancy firm funded by a government small business grant to write software to help their record keeping. This became the basis for Sage Line 50. Next, hired by David Goldman to write some estimating software for his printing company, Campbell Graphics, Graham used the same accounting software to produce the first version of Sage Accounts. David was so impressed that he hired Graham and academic Paul Muller to form Sage, selling their software first to printing companies, and then to a wider market through a network of resellers.[6]
In 1984 the Company launched Sage software, a product for the Amstrad PCW word processor,[5] which used the CP/M operating system. Sage software sales escalated in that year from 30 copies a month to over 300.[5] The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989.[5]
In 1994 Paul Walker was appointed Chief Executive. In 1998 Sage's Professional Accountants Division was established. In 1999 Sage entered FTSE 100[5] and launched a dedicated Irish division, based in Dublin as well as its e-business strategy. In that same year the UK acquisition of Tetra saw Sage enter the mid-range business software market.[7][8]
2000 to 2010[edit]




The Sage Gateshead music venue, located on the banks of the River Tyne, is named after the company.


In 2000 Sage shares were named 'best performing share of the 90s' in the UK business press.[9] In 2001 Sage acquired Interact Commerce Inc.[10] and entered the CRM/contact management market and in 2002 Sage won 'Business of The Year' in National Business Awards.[11] Also that year Sage sponsored the new Music Centre in Gateshead for £6m - now known as The Sage Gateshead - the largest ever UK arts/business sponsorship.[12] Sage are one of two technology stocks listed on the FTSE 100 Index.[13] In 2003 at age 43 Graham Wylie retired with 108.5 million shares in Sage worth £146m. He was rated Britain's 109th richest person in the 2002 Sunday Times' rich list.[6]
Tony Hobson joined the Sage board of directors in June 2004 and became chairman in May 2007.[14]
2010 to present[edit]
On 19 April 2010, Sage announced that its CEO, Paul Walker, had indicated an interest in stepping down from his position, which he had held for 16 years.[15] The Financial Times reported that his departure would lead to speculation over Sage's mergers and acquisitions, which have been a key component to the group's growth in the past 20 years. In an interview with The Times, the CEO of Sage's UK business stated that: "Acquisitions are part of our DNA".[16]
Walker was one of the longest serving CEOs of a FTSE100 company, only exceeded by Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Tullow Oil's Aidan Heavey.[17] According to the Daily Mail, Walker is likely to have left Sage with as much as £21 million given his shares, bonus plan and salary.[18] Walker left the company on 1 December 2010.[19]
On 1 October 2010 Guy Berruyer became CEO of Sage Group; Berruyer had previously been CEO of Sage's Mainland Europe & Asia operations.[19]
On 15 February 2013, Sage announced that Accel-KKR intended to buy Sage Nonprofit Solutions, the division of Sage that produces software designed for nonprofit organisations and governmental agencies.[20]
In August 2014, Sage announced that Guy Berruyer was to retire; Stephen Kelly, the UK government’s former chief operating officer, became Group CEO in November 2014.[21]
Operations[edit]
Founded and headquartered in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, the company initially grew organically, but more recently has grown primarily through acquisitions. In 2004 the company's new headquarters was completed in the Great Park area of Newcastle upon Tyne; the company was previously located at Benton Park House. It now operates worldwide. The company's US headquarters are in Atlanta, Georgia, the Canadian headquarters are in Richmond, British Columbia, the Africa, Middle East & Australia headquarters are in Johannesburg, South Africa and the French and Continental European headquarters are in Paris, France. Sage has 6.1 million customers and 13,400 employees across the world. Key industry focus includes: Healthcare; HR & Payroll; Construction/ Real-Estate; Transport/ Distribution; Payment Processing; Accountancy; Not-for-Profit; Manufacturing; Retail; Automotive Distribution.[22]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
