Publisher's Description▼▲
Struggling readers need personalized, focused, and assessment-driven instruction. In other words, they need interventions that work. Cooper, Chard, and Kiger provide those interventions in this essential resource. Covering the most important aspects of literacy&#8212 oral language, phonemic awareness, word recognition, vocabulary, fluency, comprehension, and writing&#8212the authors organize the interventions around a classroom-tested framework for assessing students, diagnosing their needs, teaching them based on findings, and reassessing them to determine whether more instruction, practice, or application are needed.
