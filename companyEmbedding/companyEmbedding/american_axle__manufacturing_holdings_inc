History[edit]
AAM was founded in 1994 when a private investor group, led by Richard E. "Dick" Dauch, James W. McLernon, Raymond Park and Morton E. Harris purchased the Final Drive and Forge Business Unit from GM's Saginaw Division. In 1999, AAM went public, and is traded as "AXL" on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). AAM has grown to supply various OEM manufacturers around the globe in the passenger car, light truck, and commercial vehicle segments.
AAM's World Headquarters building, erected in 2004, is located on the Detroit/Hamtramck border.
2008 strike[edit]
On February 26, 2008, approximately 4600 AAM employees went on what would be a three-month-long strike to protest a proposed wage and benefit cut by the company's management. The proposal would reduce production workers' hourly wage from $28 to $18 and cut skilled trade wages $5 per hour.[2] The strike cost General Motors $2.6 billion as the automaker lost the production of its Chevrolet Malibu sedan and other vehicles.[3]
Products[edit]
Key products include axles, drive shafts, front axle, universal joints and sealing and thermal-management products.
Axles[edit]

10.5" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential
Saginaw 9.5-inch axle

Demolition[edit]
After closing its factories in Detroit in 2012, American Axle and Manufacturing had started a demolition project. In late 2013, much of the old manufacturing facility had been demolished by bulldozers and cranes. Also, in February 2014, it was reported and confirmed that most of the Detroit/Hamtramck manufacturing site had been sold [4] to a California-based Industrial Realty Group, IRG LLC who specialize in the use of industrial buildings for other developments such as apartment complexes. In 2014, American Axle continued to own its headquarters and greenbelt property at the site. It planned to build an engineering facility in the sole building left standing from the original manufacturing complex.

History[edit]
AAM was founded in 1994 when a private investor group, led by Richard E. "Dick" Dauch, James W. McLernon, Raymond Park and Morton E. Harris purchased the Final Drive and Forge Business Unit from GM's Saginaw Division. In 1999, AAM went public, and is traded as "AXL" on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). AAM has grown to supply various OEM manufacturers around the globe in the passenger car, light truck, and commercial vehicle segments.
AAM's World Headquarters building, erected in 2004, is located on the Detroit/Hamtramck border.
2008 strike[edit]
On February 26, 2008, approximately 4600 AAM employees went on what would be a three-month-long strike to protest a proposed wage and benefit cut by the company's management. The proposal would reduce production workers' hourly wage from $28 to $18 and cut skilled trade wages $5 per hour.[2] The strike cost General Motors $2.6 billion as the automaker lost the production of its Chevrolet Malibu sedan and other vehicles.[3]
Products[edit]
Key products include axles, drive shafts, front axle, universal joints and sealing and thermal-management products.
Axles[edit]

10.5" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential
Saginaw 9.5-inch axle

Demolition[edit]
After closing its factories in Detroit in 2012, American Axle and Manufacturing had started a demolition project. In late 2013, much of the old manufacturing facility had been demolished by bulldozers and cranes. Also, in February 2014, it was reported and confirmed that most of the Detroit/Hamtramck manufacturing site had been sold [4] to a California-based Industrial Realty Group, IRG LLC who specialize in the use of industrial buildings for other developments such as apartment complexes. In 2014, American Axle continued to own its headquarters and greenbelt property at the site. It planned to build an engineering facility in the sole building left standing from the original manufacturing complex.

Automotive Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
The automotive industry is a growing market comprised of many subgroups which include: engineering, design, next generation manufacturing, distribution, and aftermarket. Automotive companies are focused on controlling cost, improving efficiency and utilization of alternative energy engines. 
	 Automobiles fall into several different categories based on the fuel consumed including gasoline, diesel, electric, and various hybrid or alternative fuel cars such as ethanol and combined electrical motor�heat engine drives.
Electric cars, also known as electric vehicles (EVs) are the most fuel efficient using conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) automobiles such as zero air pollution, reduced emissions, and significantly lower energy costs (on a fuel to electricity basis).

Electric cars are more expensive than traditional automotive vehicles; this primarily due to the added cost of a high�capacity battery. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) combine the traditional ICE with an electric propulsion system, and this electric powertrain gives HEVs improved fuel economy over conventional vehicles. Other green vehicles, using alternative fuels like ethanol (flex fuel cars) and compressed natural gas (CNG), have gained a broader appeal with commercial and consumer automotive markets.

In 2009, China became the largest national automotive manufacturer by production volume with the highest market as well surpassing the United States; Japan is recognized as the third�largest. The automotive industries include car or vehicle manufacturers, component and automotive part manufacturers, re�sellers, and after�market services and parts. The current global automotive markets and industries are characterized by slowly diversifying demand region, with growing demand from highly�populated developing countries.
