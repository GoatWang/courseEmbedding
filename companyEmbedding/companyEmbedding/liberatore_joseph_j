He's hired from me both at Citigroup and the New York Liquidation Bureau.  Joe is very easy to work with.  He has always let me know exactly what he expects and wants in a prospective candidate and makes it a point to let me know how the project at hand fits into the 'big picture'.  He is an excellent 'gatherer of talent'.  Feedback from candidates that I have placed with him have only good things to say.  He makes it a point to give his employees challenges that fit their skill set.  He provides them with opportunities to stand on their own.  Joe has proven to be a strong mentor to people that have worked both for and with him and he's made it a point to make those people better.  
 
Joe is always concerned with doing the right thing and has consistently risen to the challenge at hand.  Any organization would be fortunate to have Joe on board.  He is an excellent manager, is forward thinking and solution oriented.  His ability to adapt to his environment, leadership skills, attention to detail, his low key (yet focused) approach; makes him an invaluable addition to any organization.See moreSee lessJoe is a solid, well-grounded individual with sharp analytical skills with excellent accounting and financial analysis skills. Extremely diligent and always dependable, Joe was a integral part of our team at CAI. Never afraid to roll up his sleeves and dig into tasks, Joe often tackled challenging assignments for our team and was able to work effectively with senior managers and peers to accomplish business goals. Joe can always be counted on to deliver well researched facts in a thoughtful, unbiased manner. I recommend him highly.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended JosephGroupsCiti AlumniCorporate FP&A/CFO/Procurement/Sourcing/Strategy ProfessionalsSunGard Public SectorBSA-AML NY Compliance GroupExecutive Talent: Insights for the C-Suite, by AESCFinance Club New YorkWildlife Conservation SocietySee 7 moreLeaders in IT Security, Compliance & System Development in the Greater New York City AreaFinance Plus: Private Equity, Venture Capital and M&A newsFinance ClubValue Based Reimbursement - Bundled PaymentsFordham Gabelli School of Business AlumniCardinal Spellman High School Brockton, MAThe Strategic CFOSee lessView Joseph’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Joseph directlyView Joseph’s Full ProfileNot the Joseph you’re looking for?

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

Gizmodo.com
