Gencor Industries, Inc. will collect personal information such as names, home addresses, e-mail addresses, age, etc., but only when a visitor voluntarily gives it to us in the process of ordering subscriptions to the Gencor Industries, Inc. newsletters or registering with the Gencor Industries, Inc. website. This information is used internally by Gencor Industries, Inc. to fulfill your requests and for marketing and research purposes. Gencor Industries, Inc. will NOT sell, rent or give a visitor's personal information to any third party unless Gencor Industries, Inc. asks for and receives the visitor's permission at the time the personal information is collected. Gencor Industries, Inc. does however, share aggregate information about the users of Gencor Industries, Inc.'s website with our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and certain others. As mentioned above, this aggregate information is used to develop, improve and customize Gencor Industries, Inc.'s website to better serve visitors to our website. Where www.gencor.com's information collection activities involve children, www.gencor.com provides special privacy protections.
Gencor Industries, Inc. is committed to protecting the online privacy of children. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), Gencor Industries, Inc. will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without first obtaining parental consent. Prior to providing any personally identifiable information (your name, email address, address, phone number etc.), either by placing an order for merchandise, setting up a www.gencor.com account, or participating in any other activity offered through the www.gencor.com site, children under the age of thirteen (13) must have a parent or legal guardian complete and return (by mail or fax) a Parental Consent Form to www.gencor.com - Gencor Industries, Inc. ., 5201 North Orange Blossom Trail, Orlando, Florida 32810; or by fax to: 407.578.0577. The consent form states that the child's "Parent" or "Legal Guardian", by his or her signature, consents to the collection and transfer of the child's personally identifiable information. Consent may be revoked by completing a "Gencor Industries, Inc. Revocation of Parental Consent Form" and sending it to the address or fax number above.
In compliance with COPPA, Gencor Industries, Inc. is sensitive about children consulting with parents or guardians before furnishing personal information or ordering anything online. It's also Gencor Industries, Inc.'s intention to adhere to the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) Guidelines on Internet advertising with its special sensitivities regarding solicitations to children under thirteen (13). Gencor Industries, Inc. encourages parents/guardians to supervise and join their children in exploring cyberspace. Gencor Industries, Inc. is proud of its website and believes that it is suitable for Gencor Industries, Inc. fans of all ages.
Please note that if a parent does not permit www.gencor.com's use or collection of personally identifiable information or has instructed Gencor Industries, Inc. to delete personally identifiable information, a child's participation in those www.gencor.com activities for which the personally identifiable information has been requested may not be possible.
Gencor Industries, Inc. will not disclose information collected from children under the age of thirteen (13) (or from adults for that matter) to third parties unless indicated otherwise or in special cases where Gencor Industries, Inc. has reason to believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (whether intentionally or unintentionally) with Gencor Industries, Inc.'s rights or property or anyone else who may be harmed by such actions or if required by law.
Gencor Industries, Inc. recommends that parents/guardians monitor and supervise the online activities of their children and to consider using available parental control tools which can prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission. Visitors to Gencor Industries, Inc.'s website who are under thirteen (13) years old should not be submitting any personal information like their name, address, e-mail address, phone number etc. without a parent's or guardian's permission.

                                Even, consistent asphalt foam
            


            December 5, 2009
        




Gencor has devised a simple, reliable way to inject steam into the foaming process, using only the energy of the pump or head supplying the AC and water. Ultrafoam GX maintains the perfect ratio of AC and water at all production rates and creates smaller, more stable bubbles for even, consistent asphalt foaming. The system includes the special Gencor foaming generator which can be easily bolted to a three- or four-inch existing asphalt injection line going to the drum mixer. The Ultrafoam GX is hot-oil jacketed for proper heat retention and includes two hot-oil jumpers. A variable speed drive (VFD) and positive displacement water pump are mounted on a unitized skid which includes an inlet strainer, gauge, pressure switch, pressure relief valve, water flow meter, and 30 feet of 1/2-inch hose.

            December 18, 2008
        






















Gencor has devised a simple, robust and reliable method to inject steam into the foaming process, using only the energy of the pump or head supplying the AC and water. The Ultrafoam GX can achieve consistent foaming at varying production rates without the use of a powered mixing device. As a result, the AC and water can be introduced at widely different flow rates, temperatures, and pressures.
