Ecoark Holdings, Inc. Provides Sustainable Products to Largest Big Box Retailers
























Oct 20, 2016 (Marketwired via COMTEX) --
Through wholly-owned subsidiaries Pioneer Products LLC and Sable Polymer Solutions, Company has become fully integrated supplier of reclaimed plastic goods to retailers across the U.S.


                                        








ROGERS, AR--(Marketwired - October 20, 2016) -  Ecoark Holdings, Inc. ("Ecoark") (otcqb:EARK), a provider of a growing suite of proprietary technologies and services that drive sustainability and facilitate sustainable growth for a wide range of clients, today commented on its continued penetration of the recycled products industry.


                                        








As highlighted in a recent feature article from Talk Business & Politics, Ecoark has continued to grow its share of the $8B plastics polymer business by creating a fully integrated end-to-end solution for the entire lifecycle of a product, from reclamation to development to sale. This vertically integrated approach, achieved through its wholly-owned subsidiary Pioneer Products LLC and the recently acquired Sable Polymer Solutions, allows Ecoark to control more of the manufacturing process, enabling the Company to sell its product to big box retailers with greater profit potential.


                                        








The acquisition of Sable allows Pioneer to be aggressive with costs because it controls more of the supply chain. Sable also offers a non-commoditized resin product, sourced from a natural pellet material from a manufacturer in Puerto Rico that is sterile grade, allowing the Company to expand out of retail into verticals such as the automotive and healthcare industries and generate higher revenues with a greater expansion of profit margins.


                                        








"What we have created is a powerful, vertically integrated solution for recycling technologies available to the market today. Our proprietary process allows us to control manufacturing and costs, which results in higher profits and revenues," said Roshan Weerasinghe, COO, Pioneer Products. "As we continue to sell our products back in to big box retailers across the country, we are also expanding our research and development in order to expand on the range of products we can produce from these reclaimed materials. Our acquisition of Sable Polymer has made it possible for us to move outside of the retail application, and to continue expanding our presence in this growing market."


                                        








Each year, $11.5B worth of recyclable products are thrown into landfills, 70% of which is recoverable plastic materials that are worth more than $8B. A study from 2015 reported that 66% of consumers were willing to pay more for sustainable brands and products, creating an enormous market opportunity for companies than can provide those types of products to retailers.

Forward Looking Statement:


                                        








This release contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements concerning our business and possible or assumed future results of operations. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons including: our ability to continue as a going concern; adverse economic changes affecting markets we serve; competition in our markets and industry segments; our timing and the profitability of entering new markets; greater than expected costs, customer acceptance of our products or difficulties related to our integration of the businesses we may acquire; and other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and SEC filings. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, they relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made, and our future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements may not meet these expectations. We do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this document to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law.

			ABOUT US		




			
			OUR HISTORY		




			
			ECOARK		



Every year, 11.5 billion dollars of recyclable products are thrown into landfills. 70% of the recoverable material is plastic and is worth over 8 billion dollars.
A forward-thinking group of retail experts recognized that these plastics were a potential revenue stream that was being ignored.
Using innovative technology, Pioneer Products began recovering plastic waste from retail supply chains and creating new consumer products with the reclaimed material.
Pioneer was one of the first to successfully turn waste into new products for retail partners and has increased reclamation every year. Last year, Pioneer converted over 500,000 pounds of plastic into new consumer goods which are sold in retail stores across the United States.
Building on a decade of resounding success within our retail channels and fostered by the amazing retail connectivity offered by our location in Northwest Arkansas, Pioneer expanded into a sales services and marketing agency for other brands looking to solidify their presence on the shelves of retailers and in the minds of consumers.

Provides Sustainable Products to Largest Big Box RetailersMarketwiredOctober 20, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareROGERS, AR--(Marketwired - October 20, 2016) -  Ecoark Holdings, Inc. ("Ecoark") (EARK), a provider of a growing suite of proprietary technologies and services that drive sustainability and facilitate sustainable growth for a wide range of clients, today commented on its continued penetration of the recycled products industry.As highlighted in a recent feature article from Talk Business & Politics, Ecoark has continued to grow its share of the $8B plastics polymer business by creating a fully integrated end-to-end solution for the entire lifecycle of a product, from reclamation to development to sale. This vertically integrated approach, achieved through its wholly-owned subsidiary Pioneer Products LLC and the recently acquired Sable Polymer Solutions, allows Ecoark to control more of the manufacturing process, enabling the Company to sell its product to big box retailers with greater profit potential.The acquisition of Sable allows Pioneer to be aggressive with costs because it controls more of the supply chain. Sable also offers a non-commoditized resin product, sourced from a natural pellet material from a manufacturer in Puerto Rico that is sterile grade, allowing the Company to expand out of retail into verticals such as the automotive and healthcare industries and generate higher revenues with a greater expansion of profit margins."What we have created is a powerful, vertically integrated solution for recycling technologies available to the market today. Our proprietary process allows us to control manufacturing and costs, which results in higher profits and revenues," said Roshan Weerasinghe, COO, Pioneer Products. "As we continue to sell our products back in to big box retailers across the country, we are also expanding our research and development in order to expand on the range of products we can produce from these reclaimed materials. Our acquisition of Sable Polymer has made it possible for us to move outside of the retail application, and to continue expanding our presence in this growing market."Each year, $11.5B worth of recyclable products are thrown into landfills, 70% of which is recoverable plastic materials that are worth more than $8B. A study from 2015 reported that 66% of consumers were willing to pay more for sustainable brands and products, creating an enormous market opportunity for companies than can provide those types of products to retailers.About Ecoark Holdings Inc.Based in Rogers AR and founded in 2011, Ecoark Holdings, Inc. is a growth-oriented company based in the retail and logistics hub of Northwest Arkansas.
