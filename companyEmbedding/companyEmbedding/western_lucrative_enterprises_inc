	NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	A summary of significant accounting policies of Western Lucrative Enterprises, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) (the

	“

	Company

	”

	) is presented to assist in understanding the Company

	’

	s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company

	’

	s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose and is considered to be in its development state in accordance with ASC 915,

	“


	Development Stage Entities


	”

	.



	Organization, Nature of Business and Trade Name



	The Company was incorporated in the State of Iowa on July 14, 2008 and has as a principal business objective of becoming an online landscape design, construction, and consulting service.


	The Company intends to develop procedures to make the information given to a prospective purchaser as accurate as possible to lead to the highest percentage of successful Western Lucrative purchases. The Company also intends to focus only on items that can be designed without travel to the location.


	Neville Pearson was being appointed as a Director of the Company on August 14, 2010. Subsequently on August 17, 2010, he was appointed as President, Treasurer, and Secretary of the Company.



	Concentration of Risk



	The Company at times may maintain a cash balance in excess of insured limits. However, as of September 30, 2016, the Company has no cash in excess of insured limits.



	Basis of Presentation



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company's system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that (1) recorded transactions are valid; (2) all valid transactions are recorded and (3) transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented.



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements

	’

	estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company

	’

	s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred.


	Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company

	’

	s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

	NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)










	Accounts Receivable






	Accounts receivable, if any, is carried at the expected net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts, when determined, will be based on management's assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivables. If there were a deterioration of a major customer's creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have a negative impact on operations.


	 


	The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operation to date. The Company currently does not have any accounts receivable. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company carries accounts receivable.






	Property and Equipment






	Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period.





	Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are:





	Estimated


	           


	            

	Useful Lives



	Office Equipment


	5-10 years


	Copier


	  


	5 - 7 years


	Vehicles


	5-10 years


	Website


	/ Software


	                


	10-15 years








	For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method.





	The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operation to date. The Company currently does not have any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment.






	Accounts Payable and Accrued expense






	The Company has accounts payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $27,815 and $26,015 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively.






	Revenue and Cost Recognition



	The Company intends to provide a landscape design and consulting service via a web site. The Company reports income and expenses on the accrual basis of accounting, whereby income is recorded when it is earned and expenses recorded when they are incurred. The Company currently does not yet have a working website; therefore, it has not realized any sales that would require recognition of revenue.

	NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)



	The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. The


	Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. The Company does not have financial assets as an investment carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016.


	The availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For many financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments, pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has assets and liabilities in cash, various receivables, property and equipment, and various payables. Management believes that they are being presented at their fair market value.



	Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share



	Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share." The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic loss per share. Diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares are additional common shares assumed to be exercised. We do not calculate loss per diluted shares to prevent understating the actual loss per share


	Basic net loss per common share is based on the weighted-average number of share of common stock outstanding since inception. As of September 30,  2016 and since inception, the Company had 8,505,000 common shares outstanding and 9,595,200 dilutive potential common shares.


	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of the following types of potentially dilutive instruments:


	·


	Warrants,


	·


	Employee stock options, and



	Basic and Diluted Loss per common share (Continued)



	·


	Other equity awards, which include long-term incentive awards.


	The FASB ASC Topic 260,

	Earnings per Share

	, requires the Company to include additional shares in the computation of earnings per share, assuming dilution.  


	Diluted earnings per share are based on the assumption that all dilutive options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options are assumed to be exercised at the time of issuance, and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The Company does not have diluted

	’

	s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.



	NOTE B - GOING CONCERN






	The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern.





	Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations.





	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.


	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  





	In the coming year, the Company

	’

	s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.


	Historically, as the Company has no business revenues, it has mostly relied upon funds contributed by shareholders and associated companies to finance its overheads and research. Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company

	’

	s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company

	’

	s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.

	Convertible Notes to Magellan Capital Partner, Inc. and Savile Town Investments, Inc.






	The Company received service through issuing a total of $7,500 convertible notes to Magellan Capital Partners and Savile Town Investments, Inc. In exchange for the $7,500 notes, the two lenders would have an option to receive a total of 750,000 common shares by fully converting these shares at $0.01 per diluted common shares.In accordance with ASC 470-20, Debt with conversion and other options, as the conversion price of the share is a fixed price at $0.01 per diluted common shares, the beneficial conversion feature or BCF of Notes were calculated based on the intrinsic value. The fair value of the shares at the issuance date, December 31, 2012 was $0.52 and the BCF is $0.51 per share. As the total BCF is greater than the total proceeds of the $7,500 convertible notes, in accordance with ASC 470-20 the BCF is limited to the total proceeds of the convertible notes which is $7,500. We recorded the total convertible value of the notes issued to the Company in the amount of $7,500 as a debt discount upon issuance, and amortized this debt discount as interest expense over the life of the note. We recorded interest expense in the amount of $158 for the 3 Months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with these Notes.






	Convertible Note to Millenium Group, Inc.






	The original beneficial conversion feature was resulted from a note issued to Millenium Group, Inc. in the amount of $10,000 on August 20, 2010. The note is convertible at holder

	NOTE D

	–

	INCOME TAX






	The Company did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception. Under ACS 740


	“

	Income Taxes,

	”


	when it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit.  We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carry-forwards, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry-forward period.





	The Company has not taken a tax position that, if challenged, would have a material effect on the financial statements for the periods ended September 30, 2016 or 2015, applicable under ACS 740.  As a result of the adoption of ACS 740, we did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain tax position and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet.

	ITEM 2.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS




	OF OPERATIONS.



	Certain statements in this report and elsewhere (such as in other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), press releases

	,

	presentations by the Company of its management and oral statements) may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

	.

	Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans

	,

	" "believes," "seeks," "estimates," and "should," and variations of these words and similar expressions, are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements

	.

	Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, among others, competitive pressures and constantly changing technology and market acceptance of the Company's products and services

	.

	The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements

	,

	which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.


	Western Lucrative Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated on July 14, 2008. As of the date of this document, we have generated no revenues and substantial expenses. This resulted in a net loss of

	$


	113


	,


	625



	since inception, which is attributable to general and administrative expenses plus professional fees. The losses incurred for the nine month period to September, 2016 and the nine month period to September 30, 2015 were $2,273 and $2,270 respectively. These losses can be attributed to accrued interest on Convertible Notes and accrued professional fees. There are no General & Administrative expenses being incurred other than audit fees. The sole officer provides all necessary administrative services free of charge. Since incorporation, we have financed our operations primarily through minimal initial capitalization. To date we have not implemented our planned principal operations

	.






	We do not expect to conduct any research and development.

	We do not own any plant or equipment.




	Our management does not anticipate any significant changes in the number of employees in the next 12 months.  Currently, we believe the services provided by our officers and directors are sufficient at this time. We have not paid for expenses on behalf of any director. Additionally, we believe that this practice will not materially change.



	In 2010, we engaged Millennium Group, Inc to assist the Company with new business strategies and options. Millennium Group is a consulting services firm owned and managed by Jonathan Mork, 47. A pension plan of which his father, Dempsey Mork, is a beneficiary owns more than 5% of our stock. We issued to Millennium Group a $10,000 convertible note as a non-refundable retainer to Millennium Group.  We also agreed to pay $400,000 to Millennium if it is able to introduce a major acquisition to the Company.   The note is due and payable to Millennium in two years, and bears a 5% interest rate which shall accrue annually and be payable at maturity. At Millennium

	’

	s election, this note and any accrued interest can be retired at any earlier time by conversion into common shares. The note is convertible into 4.0% of the Company

	’

	s fully diluted common shares at the time of conversion, with full anti-dilution protection (not adjusted for splits or new issuances). The Company has also agreed that any shares issued under this note will have piggyback registration rights. The Board of Directors of the Company has approved and ratified the terms of this note.



	Convertible Notes to Magellan Capital Partner, Inc. and Savile Town Investments, Inc.  

	During the Year Ended December 31, 2012, the Company received service through issuing a total of $7,500 convertible notes to Magellan Capital Partners Inc. and Savile Town Investments, Inc. In exchanging for the $7,500 notes, the two lenders would have option to receive a total of 750,000 common shares by fully converting these shares at $0.01 per diluted common shares.


	In accordance with ASC 470-20,

	Debt with conversions and other options

	, as the conversion price of the share is a fixed price at $0.01 per diluted common shares, the beneficial conversion features or BCF of these Notes were calculated based on the intrinsic value.  The fair value of the shares at the issuance date, December 31, 2012 was $0.52 and the BCF is $0.51 per share.  As the total BCF is greater than the total proceed of the $7,500 convertible notes, in accordance with ASC 470-20, the BCF is limited to the total proceed of the convertible notes which is $7,500.  We recorded the total convertible value of the notes issued to the Company in the amount of $7,500 as a debt


	discount upon issuance, and amortized this debt discount as interest expense over the life of the note. We recorded interest expense in the amount of $473 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in connection with these Notes.

	ITEM 3.       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.



	As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this item

	.









	ITEM 4.      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.




	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	Our management, with the participation of our president and chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the


	effectiveness of our

	"disclosure

	controls and procedures" (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15


	(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the

	"Evaluation

	Date"). Based upon that evaluation, the president


	and chief financial officer concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are not


	effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the


	Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules


	and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president and chief financial


	officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure since our auditor had to make audit


	adjustments. Our management intends to work more closely with our auditors to correct this ineffectiveness.



	(b) Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as


	defined in Rule 13a-I5(f) and 15(d)-15(f)


	under the 1934 Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by


	the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.


	\


	Our management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective


	based on these criteria.

	In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of


	September


	30,


	2016


	, we determined that the following deficiencies constituted a materia


	l weakness, as described below.



	1.


	Certain entity level controls establishing a

	“

	tone at the top

	”

	were considered material weaknesses. The Company has no audit committee. There is no policy on fraud and no code of ethics at this time.  A whistleblower policy is not necessary given the small size of the organization.


	2.


	Management override of existing controls is possible given the small size of the organization and lack of personnel.


	3.


	There is no system in place to review and monitor internal control over financial reporting. The Company maintains an insufficient complement of personnel to carry out ongoing monitoring responsibilities and ensure effective internal control over financial reporting.


	Management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiencies.


	 


	Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company

	’

	s internal controls.


	This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our  registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this quarterly report.






	(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	PART 1









	ITEM 1

	.

	BUSINESS.




	CORPORATE BACKGROUND



	Western Lucrative Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Iowa on July 14, 2008.



	Our Business



	We are a development stage company whose business plan is to develop an online landscape design construction and consulting business to service do-it-yourself individuals and companies who want to beautify their home or business without the cost and disruption of designers

	/

	architects

	/

	construction workers.


	Our current business model is built around online delivery using the Internet. The World Wide Web has become an economical distribution channel. We plan to leverage the technological innovations of the Internet to offer our services to clients, to communicate directly with them, to provide consulting and design services, to advertise our designs books, to sell designs

	,

	and to perform all necessary financial transactions

	electronically.

	We plan to use the online services of Pay Pal for customer orders.


	Our plan is to outsource the development of the website and to launch our marketing plan. Initially

	,

	we plan to commence marketing of our services using Google and Yahoo website CPC programs and through viral marketing, such as blogs, postings on online communities such as Yahoo!(R) Groups and amateur websites such as YouTube

	.

	com, and other methods of

	getting

	Internet users to refer others to our website by e-mail or word of mouth. We also intend to use search engine optimization, the marketing of our website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in search result, and to enter into affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to increase our access to Internet consumers

	.

	In our management's opinion there will be a need for design consulting in the do-it-yourself sector of the market once the current housing market returns to more normal levels of activity.


	Due to financial limitations, our operations to date have been limited to conceptual planning.   We are now considering alternative business directions that can maximize shareholder value such as acquisitions.   To date the Company and its officers and directors have not had any contract or discussions with any target acquisition or with the owners or representatives of any target acquisitions



	Our Competition



	See the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion on the competition we currently face or may face in the future.



	Proprietary Rights



	We currently have no proprietary rights.



	Our Research and Development



	We are not currently conducting any research and development activities

	.




	Government Regulation



	See the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion relevant government regulation and the legal uncertainties related to our business activities

	.




	Employees



	As of December 31, 2016 we have no employees other than our sole officer and director and one additional director. We anticipate that we will not hire any employees in the next twelve months, unless we generate significant revenues, raise capital, or make a complete change of course from our current business plan.





	4







	Item 1A. Risk Factors



	Our auditor has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months. As such we may have to cease all operations and our shares could become wholly worthless.


	We lack an operating history and have losses that we expect to continue into the future

	.

	There is no assurance that future operations will result in profits

	.

	If we cannot generate sufficient revenues or raise capital, we could cease operations and our shares could become wholly worthless.


	We were incorporated on July 14, 2008 and we have not started our proposed business operations or realized any revenues

	.



	We have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made.


	Our ability to achieve profits is dependent on



	•

	our ability to raise capital and develop and continually update a functional, user-friendly website;



	•

	our ability to procure and maintain on commercially reasonable terms relationships with third parties to develop and


	maintain



	•

	our website, network infrastructure, and transaction processing systems;



	•

	our ability to identify and pursue mediums through which we will be able to market our products;



	•

	our ability to attract customers to our website

	;




	•

	our ability to generate revenues through sales on our website; and



	•

	our ability to complete an alternative plan such as an acquisition


	To date we do not have any customers

	.

	We cannot guarantee that we will ever have any customers

	.

	Even if we obtain customers

	,

	there is no guarantee that we will generate a profit. If we cannot generate a profit and cannot raise additional capital, we may have to suspend or cease operations

	.



	The landscape design industry is highly competitive. Many competitors have longer operating histories

	,

	greater brand recognition, broader product l

	i

	nes and greater financial resources and advertising budgets than we do. Many of our competitors offer similar products or alternatives to our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in this marketplace.


	We have not developed our website

	,

	network infrastructure, or transaction processing systems, and if we fail to raise sufficient capital,

	we



	may fail to complete our website or become fully operational.   We are contemplating other possible business directions including acquisitions.  There can be no assurance that either our original business plan or a possible acquisition will take place. If we are unable to accomplish our plan or an alternative such as an acquisition, our shares could become wholly worthless.     






	ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.



	Not applicable since the Company is a smaller reporting company.






	ITEM 2. PROPERTIES



	The Company does not own any property at the present time and has no agreements to acquire any property. Our executive offices are located at 78625 Avenida Ultimo, La Quinta, CA 92253. This address is the personal residence of our Sole Officer who makes no charge for providing office space to The Company. We believe that this space is adequate for our needs at this time, and we believe that we will be able to locate additional space in the future, if needed, on commercially reasonable terms.

	ITEM 5. MARKET FOR OUR COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.




	(a) Market Information.

	Our Common Stock has been approved to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board.   To date there has been no trading in our shares. No assurance can be given that any market for our Common Stock will ever develop.



	(b)Increase in Authorized Share Capital.

	On November 23, 2010 the Shareholders approved an increase in the Authorized Share Capital from 75,000,000 to 750,000,000.  A Definitive Form 14C report was filed with the SEC on December 17, 2010.



	(c) Holders.

	As of

	,

	December 31, 2016 there were 42 shareholders of all of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.






	ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.



	As a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we are not required to provide the information required by this item.






	ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.



	Certain statements in this report and elsewhere (such as in other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), press releases

	,

	presentations by the Company of its management and oral statements) may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

	.

	Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans

	,

	" "believes," "seeks," "estimates," and "should," and variations of these words and similar expressions, are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements

	.

	Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, among others, competitive pressures and constantly changing technology and market acceptance of the Company's products and services

	.

	The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements

	,

	which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.


	Western Lucrative Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated on July 14, 2008. As of the date of this document, we have generated no revenues and substantial expenses. This resulted in a net loss of

	$


	111


	,


	127



	since inception, which is attributable to general and administrative expenses.


	On August 17, 2010, Due to his impending retirement, Mr. Randall Baker resigned his position as the sole officer of the company and moved to a different State, although unable to participate in any day to day duties he remained as a director. Mr. Neville Pearson replaced Mr. Baker as the sole officer, and was also appointed a director. This information was previously reported on a Current Report on Form








	6









	8-K.


	Since incorporation, we have financed our operations primarily through minimal initial capitalization.


	To date we have not implemented our planned principal operations

	.






	We do not expect to conduct any research and development.





	We do not own any plant or equipment.


	Our management does not anticipate any significant changes in the number of employees in the next 12 months.  Currently, we believe the services provided by our officers and directors are sufficient at this time.


	We have not paid for expenses on behalf of any director. Additionally, we believe that this practice will not materially change.


	In 2010, we engaged Millennium Group, Inc. to assist the Company with new business strategies and options. Millennium Group is a consulting services firm owned and managed by Jonathan Mork, 51. A pension plan of which his father, Dempsey Mork, is a beneficiary is the owner of Orion Investment, which owns more than 5% of our stock. We issued to Millennium Group a $10,000 convertible note as a non-refundable retainer to Millennium Group.  We also agreed to pay $400,000 to Millennium if it is able to introduce a major acquisition to the Company.   The note is due and payable to Millennium in two years, and bears a 5% interest rate which shall accrue annually and be payable at maturity. At Millennium

	’

	s election, this note and any accrued interest can be retired at any earlier time by conversion into common shares. The note is convertible into 4.0% of the Company

	’

	s fully diluted common shares at the time of conversion, with full anti-dilution protection (not adjusted for splits or new issuances). The Company has also agreed that any shares issued under this note will have piggyback registration rights. The Board of Directors of the Company has approved and ratified the terms of this note.






	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.





	(ii) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	The Company has earned no significant revenue or profits to date, and the Company anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. The Company incurred a net loss of $6,430 for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, as compared to a net loss of $6,432 for 2015

	.

	From the date of inception July 14, 2008, to Dec. 31, 2016 the Company lost a total of $117,807. Most labor and services have been compensated with issuances of stock and convertible notes payable.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	The Company has financed its expenses and costs thus far through financing and through the increase in its accounts payable, payments made by others for the company and by the settlement of the payable amounts with shares of common stock of the Company. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a cash of $0 compared to cash of $0 as of December 31, 2015.


	For the most recent fiscal year, 2016, the Company showed

	a


	loss

	in the amount of $6,430 and a loss of $6,432 for 2015. The loss in the current year arose from the accrual of interest on the Notes Payable and the accrued Audit Fee. The earlier years

	’

	losses are a result of organizational expenses, professional fees and expenses associated with setting up a Company structure in order to begin implementing its business plan.


	The 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 audit fees are also accrued and payable to the major shareholder and/or The Company

	’

	s Auditor (if not yet paid directly by the major shareholder.  


	During the period from July 14, 2008 (date of inception) through Dec. 31, 2016, the Company has incurred an


	accumulated net loss of $117,807 and has not attained profitable operations. The Company is dependent upon obtaining


	adequate financing to enable it to pursue its business plan and manage its operations so that they are profitable.









	7






	(iii) The Company has limited financial resources available, which has had an adverse impact on the Company's liquidity, activities and operations. These limitations have adversely affected the Company's ability to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise sufficient funding to enhance the Company's financial resources sufficiently to generate volume for the Company, or to engage in any significant research and development, or purchase plant or significant equipment.


	Management has been successful in raising sufficient funds to cover the Company's compliance expenses including the cost of auditing and filing required documents for 2016.


	The Company as a whole may continue to operate at a loss for an indeterminate period thereafter, depending upon the


	performance of its new businesses. In the process of carrying out its business plan, the Company will continue to


	identify new financial partners and investors

	.

	However, it may determine that it cannot raise sufficient capital to


	support its business on acceptable terms, or at all. Accordingly,

	there

	can be no assurance that any additional funds

	will be available on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. As of Dec. 31

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	As of Dec

	,

	we have no off-balance sheet arrangements such as guarantees, retained or contingent interest in assets transferred

	,

	obligation under a derivative instrument and obligation arising out of or a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity.

	.







	ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.



	Not Applicable.






	ITEM 9A(T).CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.




	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	Our management, with the participation of our president and chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the


	effectiveness of our

	"disclosure

	controls and procedures" (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15


	(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the

	"Evaluation

	Date"). Based upon that evaluation, the president


	and chief financial officer concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are not


	effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the


	Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules


	and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president and chief financial


	officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure since our auditor had to make audit









	8












	adjustments. Our management intends to work more closely with our auditors to correct this ineffectiveness.



	(b) Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as


	defined in Rule 13a-I5(f)under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control


	over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by


	the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.


	\


	Our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective


	based on these criteria.

	In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 201


	6


	, we determined that the following deficiencies constituted a material weakness, as described below.






	1.


	Certain entity level controls establishing a

	“

	tone at the top

	”

	were considered material weaknesses. The Company has no audit committee. There is no policy on fraud and no code of ethics at this time.  A whistleblower policy is not necessary given the small size of the organization.


	2.


	Management override of existing controls is possible given the small size of the organization and lack of personnel.


	3.


	There is no system in place to review and monitor internal control over financial reporting. The Company maintains an insufficient complement of personnel to carry out ongoing monitoring responsibilities and ensure effective internal control over financial reporting.


	Management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiencies.


	 


	Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company

	’

	s internal controls. However, as the Company currently has no business operations of any kind, all "controls" would be theoretical at best. There is no chance of a material misstatement when all the Company does is pay audit fees.





	This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this annual report.






	(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	PART III






	ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.



	The following table sets forth information concerning our officers and directors as of December 31, 2016:








	             Name                       Age                           Positions(s)                                                     Period of Service



	  Neville Pearson                    72   President, Chief Executive Officer and Director         August 14, 2010

	–

	to date













	9








	  Randall Baker                      74          Director                                                                       Inception

	–

	to date








	Our officers and directors are elected to hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their respective successors have been elected and qualified, or until prior resignation or removal.


	Business Experience


	Mr. Baker has forty years of extensive experience in the securities industry. He has been a series 7 licensed broker/trader, working mainly on the trading side of the industry, managing people, computer systems and was the executive vice president for Wm. Mason & Co., a Los Angeles based Investment Counseling firm for twenty three years through 1993. Since that time he has been CEO and managing Director of several start-up companies. He is very much involved in the administration process of mergers and acquisitions, including the filings as well as the marketing for this process.





	Mr. Pearson is a Fellow of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, and has gained over 40 years of senior level financial management experience at CFO / Controller level with both Public Multi-National and Private Companies on three continents. Mr. Pearson brings extensive experience in the Real Estate Development and Construction fields, as well as having worked in the Automotive, Mining and Food manufacturing sectors. Mr. Pearson also has recent experience in the execution of mergers and acquisitions.









	Compensation and Audit Committees






	As we only have two board members and given our limited operations, we do not have separate or independent audit or compensation committees. Our Board of Directors has determined that it does not have an

	"audit

	committee financial expert," as that term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. In addition, we have not adopted any procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors.






	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance



	Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our Common Stock (collectively, the

	"Reporting

	Persons") to report their ownership of, and transactions in our Common Stock to the SEC. Copies of these reports are also required to be supplied

	to

	us. To our knowledge, during the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2016 the Reporting Persons complied with all applicable Section 16(a) reporting requirements.






	Code of Ethics



	We have not adopted a Code of Ethics given our limited operations

	.

	We expect that our Board of Directors following a merger or other acquisition transaction will adopt a Code of

	Ethics.






	ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.



	Neither of our Directors, including the sole officer receives any compensation for their services rendered on our behalf. They did not receive any compensation during the years ended Dec. 31, 2016 and 2015. No officer or director is required to make any specific amount or percentage of his business time available to us.



	Director Compensation



	We do not currently pay any cash fees to our sole director, nor do we pay director's expenses in attending board meetings.

	Yu Certified Public Accountant, P.C.



	Professionalism, Expertise, Integrity








	To the Audit Committee of the


	Board of Directors and Shareholders of Western Lucrative Enterprise Inc.








	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Western Lucrative Enterprise Inc.(the  

	“

	Company

	”

	) as of December 31, 2016 and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders

	’

	equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company

	’

	s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.





	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Untied States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.





	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company

	’

	s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.





	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Western Lucrative Enterprise Inc. as of December 31, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses and has experienced negative cash flows from operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to those matters are also described in Note B to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Notes to Financial Statements




	December 31, 2016 and 2015




	___________________________________________________________________________________________________________










	NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	A summary of significant accounting policies of Western Lucrative Enterprises, Inc. (A Development Stage Company) (the

	“

	Company

	”

	) is presented to assist in understanding the Company

	’

	s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company

	’

	s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose and is considered to be in its development state in accordance with ASC 915,

	“


	Development Stage Entities


	”

	.



	Organization, Nature of Business and Trade Name



	The Company was incorporated in the State of Iowa on July 14, 2008 and has as a principal business objective of becoming an online landscape design, construction, and consulting service.


	The Company intends to develop procedures to make the information given to a prospective purchaser as accurate as possible to lead to the highest percentage of successful Western Lucrative purchases. The Company also intends to focus only on items that can be designed without travel to the location.


	Neville Pearson was being appointed as a Director of the Company on August 14, 2010. Subsequently on August 17, 2010, he was appointed as President, Treasurer, and Secretary of the Company.



	Concentration of Risk



	The Company at times may maintain a cash balance in excess of insured limits. However, as of December 31, 2016, the Company has no cash in excess of insured limits.



	Basis of Presentation



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices, establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud. The Company's system of internal accounting control is designed to assure, among other items, that (1) recorded transactions are valid; (2) all valid transactions are recorded and (3) transactions are recorded in the period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented.



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements

	’

	estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company

	’

	s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred.


	Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company

	’

	s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.

	Cash and Cash Equivalents






	For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.






	NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)










	Accounts Receivable






	Accounts receivable, if any, is carried at the expected net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts, when determined, will be based on management's assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivables. If there were a deterioration of a major customer's creditworthiness, or actual defaults were higher than historical experience, our estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due to us could be overstated, which could have a negative impact on operations.





	The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operation to date. The Company currently does not have any accounts receivable. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company carries accounts receivable.






	Property and Equipment






	Property and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period.





	Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are:





	Estimated



	Useful Lives



	Office Equipment


	5-10 years


	Copier


	5 - 7 years


	Vehicles


	5-10 years


	Website


	/ Software


	10-15 years








	For federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method.





	The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operation to date. The Company currently does not have any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment.






	Accounts Payable and Accrued expense






	The Company has accounts payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $26,015, and $26,015 as of December 31, 2016, and 2015 respectively.





	During the course of the audit it was pointed out that the annual audit fees for 2012 and 2013 in the amounts of $3,750 for each year had in fact been paid directly by the majority shareholder, and the liability of the company to the shareholder was not yet reflected in the professional fees expenses or the accounts payable balance for those years. This situation has now been corrected.

	Revenue and Cost Recognition



	The Company intends to provide a landscape design and consulting service via a web site. The Company reports income and expenses on the accrual basis of accounting, whereby income is recorded when it is earned and expenses recorded when they are incurred. The Company currently does not yet have a working website; therefore, it has not realized any sales that would require recognition of revenue.



	NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)




	Advertising



	Advertising expenses related to specific jobs are allocated and classified as costs of goods sold. Advertising expenses not related to


	specific jobs are recorded as general and administrative expenses. No advertising expense was incurred for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.









	Stockholders

	’

	Equity: Common Stock






	The holders of the Company

	’

	s common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of assets or funds legally available for the payment of dividends of such times and in such amounts as the board from time to time may determine.  Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.  There is no cumulative voting of the election of directors then standing for election.  The common stock is not entitled to pre-emptive rights and is not subject to conversion or redemption.  Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, the assets legally available for distribution to stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders of the common stock after payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding payment of other claims of creditors.


	The Company has authorized seven hundred and fifty million shares of common stock with a par value of $.001. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there are 8,505,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.



	Fair Value Measurements



	In January 2010, the FASB ASC Topic 825,

	Financial Instruments

	, requires

	 

	disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in quarterly reports as well as in annual reports.  For the Company, this statement applies to certain investments and long-term debt.  Also, the FASB ASC Topic 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,

	clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.   


	Various inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company

	’

	s investments and long-term debt.  The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities.  These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.


	·


	Level 1

	–

	observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.


	·


	Level 2

	–

	other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc

	…

	).






	Fair Value Measurements (Continued)



	·


	Level 3

	–

	significant unobservable inputs (including the Company

	’

	s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

	Notes to Financial Statements




	December 31, 2016 and 2015




	_______________________________________________________________________________________________________



	The Company

	’

	s adoption of FASB ASC Topic 825 effectively at the inception did not have a material impact on the Company

	’

	s financial statements.



	NOTE A - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)



	The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. The


	Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. The Company does not have financial assets as an investment carried at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016.


	The availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is actively traded, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. For many financial instruments, pricing inputs are readily observable in the market, the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market


	participants, and the valuation does not require significant management discretion. For other financial instruments, pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has assets and liabilities in cash, various receivables, property and equipment, and various payables. Management believes that they are being presented at their fair market value.



	Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share



	Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share." The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic loss per share. Diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares are additional common shares assumed to be exercised. We do not calculate loss per diluted shares to prevent understating the actual loss per share


	Basic net loss per common share is based on the weighted-average number of share of common stock outstanding since inception. As of December 31, 2016 and since inception, the Company had 8,505,000 common shares outstanding and 9,595,200 dilutive potential common shares.


	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of the following types of potentially dilutive instruments:


	·


	Warrants,


	·


	Employee stock options, and



	Basic and Diluted Loss per common share (Continued)



	·


	Other equity awards, which include long-term incentive awards.


	The FASB ASC Topic 260,

	Earnings per Share

	, requires the Company to include additional shares in the computation of earnings per share, assuming dilution.

	Diluted earnings per share are based on the assumption that all dilutive options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options are assumed to be exercised at the time of issuance, and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The Company does not have diluted

Basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as there was no dilutive effect of outstanding stock options for the period ended December 31, 2016.

	“

	Income Taxes,

	”


	we provide for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not.

	The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the following 32 ASU

	’

	s (Accounting Standards Updates) during 2016 & 2015.



	Due to the fact that The Company is not yet an operating entity none of these pronouncements have any relevance at this time. Should anyone wish to read further detail, then the full text of these pronouncements can be found at http://www.fasb.org

	(A Development Stage Company)




	Notes to Financial Statements




	December 31, 2016 and 2015







	NOTE B - GOING CONCERN






	The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern.





	Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations.





	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.


	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  





	In the coming year, the Company

	’

	s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.





	Historically, as the Company has no business revenues, it has mostly relied upon funds contributed by shareholders and associated companies to finance its overheads and research. Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company

	’

	s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company

	’

	s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.  









	NOTE C

	NOTES PAYABLE & DEBT DISCOUNTS






	On December 31, 2012, the Company issued two new Convertible Notes in the amounts of $6,000 and $1,500 to Magellan Capital Partners, Inc. and Savile Town Investments, Inc. respectively.





	The chart below summarizes the term of the Notes Payable & Debt Discounts of the Company as of December 31, 2016. The Company is currently in good standing of its promissory notes to Millenium Group, Inc. (

	“

	Millenium

	”

	), a California corporation, Magellan Capital Partners (

	“

	Magellan

	Terms











	Amount





	 







	Notes Payable to Related Party (Millenium):

	Effective as of August 20, 2010; principal of $10,000 at 2.5% APR; convertible into 4% of fully diluted common shares; due on August 20, 2017, net of unamortized discount related to the debt accretion of $0.






	Notes Payable to Related Party (Magellan):

	Effective as of December 31, 2012; principal of $6,000 at 5.0% APR; convertible into 600,000 fully diluted common shares; due on December 31, 2017, net of unamortized discount related to the debt accretion of $0.






	Notes Payable to Related Party (Savile Town):

	Effective as of December 31, 2012; principal of $1,500 at 5.0% APR; convertible into 150,000 fully diluted common shares; due on December 31, 2017, net of unamortized discount related to the debt accretion of $0.




































	$10,000











	  $6,000











	  $1,500










































	Convertible Notes to Magellan Capital Partner, Inc. and Savile Town Investments, Inc.






	The Company received service through issuing a total of $7,500 convertible notes to Magellan Capital Partners and Savile Town Investments, Inc. In exchange for the $7,500 notes, the two lenders would have an option to receive a total of 750,000 common shares by fully converting these shares at $0.01 per diluted common shares.





	In accordance with ASC 470-20,

	Debt with conversion and other options

	, as the conversion price of the share is a fixed price at $0.01 per diluted common shares, the beneficial conversion feature or BCF of Notes were calculated based on the intrinsic value. The fair value of the shares at the issuance date, December 31, 2012was $0.52 and the BCF is $0.51 per share. As the total BCF is greater than the total proceeds of the $7,500 convertible notes, in accordance with ASC 470-20 the BCF is limited to the total proceeds of the convertible notes which is $7,500. We recorded the total convertible value of the notes issued to the Company in the amount of $7,500 as a debt discount upon issuance, and amortized this debt discount as interest expense over the life of the note. We recorded interest expense in the amount of $627 for the year ended December 2016 in connection with these Notes.






	Convertible Note to Millenium Group, Inc.






	The original beneficial conversion feature was resulted from a note issued to Millenium Group, Inc. in the amount of $10,000 on August 20, 2010. The note is convertible at holder

	’

	s option into 4% of the Company

	’

	s fully diluted common shares at the time of conversion, with anti-dilution protection (not adjusted for splits or new issuances), and matures on August 20, 2016.


	On August 20, 2016, this note was renewed and the mature date is extended to August 20, 2017. No beneficial conversion feature occurs with this note renewal since the beneficial conversion feature had been recognized, and had been completely amortized. As of December 31, 2016, there is $1,592.47 accrued interest which is due on the maturity date of note.

	INCOME TAX






	The Company did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception. Under ACS 740


	“

	Income Taxes,

	”


	when it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit.  We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carry-forwards, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry-forward period.





	The Company has not taken a tax position that, if challenged, would have a material effect on the financial statements for the periods ended December 31, 2016 or 2015, applicable under ACS 740.  As a result of the adoption of ACS 740, we did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain tax position and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet.








	The component of the Company

	’

	s deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:

FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENT INFORMATION

 

Certain
statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are
“forward-looking statements” regarding the plans and
objectives of management for future operations. Such statements
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to
be materially different from any future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are
based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and
uncertainties. Our plans and objectives are based, in part, on
assumptions involving judgments with respect to, among other
things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and
future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible
to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.
Although we believe that our assumptions underlying the
forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions
could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance
that the forward-looking statements included in this report will
prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties
inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein
particularly in view of the current state of our operations, the
inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a statement
by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be
achieved. Factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth
herein under the headings “Business,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk
Factors”. We undertake no obligation to revise or update
publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. The terms
“we”, “our”, “us”, or any
derivative thereof, as used herein refer to Western Lucrative
Enterprises, Inc.

BUSINESS.

 

CORPORATE
BACKGROUND

 Western
Lucrative Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated pursuant to the laws
of the State of Iowa on July 14, 2008.

Our
Business

We are a
development stage company. We plan to develop an online landscape
design construction and consulting business.  Our internet
based company will service do it yourself individuals or companies
who want to beautify their home or business without the cost and
disruption of designers/architects/construction workers.  Our
company will not charge a fee to clients for initial consulting
questions, but rather will focus on sales and marketing efforts to
earn revenue on each incremental sale of services or designs to
customers.  We have  commenced  only limited 
operations,  primarily focused on plans for designing 
and  launching an  "information  only" website to
start to build  brand  awareness  of our 
planned  business.  We have never declared bankruptcy,
have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in
any legal action or proceedings.  We have not made any
significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has the Company been
involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. We are not
a blank check registrant as that term is defined in Rule 
419(a)(2)  of  Regulation C of the  Securities 
Act of 1933, because  we  have  a 
specific  business  plan  and 
purpose.   Neither the Company, nor its officers, 
directors,  promoters or affiliates,  has had
preliminary  contact or discussions  with, nor do we have
any present plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with
any representatives of the owners of any  business or
company  regarding  the  possibility  of
an  acquisition  or merger.

Our
business model is built around online delivery using the internet.
The World Wide Web has become an economical distribution channel.
We plan to leverage the technological  innovations of the
internet to offer our services to clients,  to
communicate  directly with them,  to provide 
consulting and design  services,  to advertise our
designs books, to sell designs, and to perform all necessary
financial transactions electronically.  We plan to use the
online services of PayPal for customer orders.

Our plan
of operation is to outsource the development of the website and to
launch our marketing plan.  Initially, we plan to commence
marketing of our services using Google and Yahoo website CPC
programs and through viral marketing, such as blogs, postings on
online communities such as Yahoo!(R) Groups and amateur websites
such as YouTube.com, and other methods of getting Internet users to
refer others to our website by e-mail or word of mouth. We also
intend to use search engine optimization, the marketing of our
website via search engines by purchasing sponsored placement in
search result, and to enter into affiliate marketing relationships
with website providers to increase our access to Internet
consumers. In our management’s opinion there is a need for
design consulting in the do it yourself sector of the
market.

 We
intend to develop procedures to make the information given to a
prospective purchaser as accurate as possible to lead to the
highest percentage of successful Western Lucrative
purchases.   We intend to focus only on items which can
be designed without travel to the location.

Our
Competition

See the
Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion on the
competition we currently face or may face in the future.

Proprietary
Rights

See the
Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion on the
intellectual property issues we face in our business.

Our
Research and Development

We are not
currently conducting any research and development activities. For
all lines of products we will offer, we intend to rely on concepts
and other intellectual property developed by Randall A. Baker our
sole officer and director. Mr. Baker is under no contractual
obligation to the Company to continue to develop new lines of
websites nor is he under any contractual obligation to assign his
rights in any new lines of websites to the Company. We do not
intend to use any other person other than Mr. Baker as a source for
new lines of websites or products. We intend to rely on third party
service providers to continue the development of concepts developed
by Mr. Baker and assigned to Western Lucrative
Enterprises.

Government
Regulation

See the
Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion relevant
government regulation and the legal uncertainties related to our
business activities.

Employees

As ofMarch
31, 2010 we have no employees other than our sole officer and
director. We anticipate that we will not hire any employees in the
next twelve months, unless we generate significant revenues. We
believe our future success depends in large part upon the continued
service of our sole officer and director, Randall A.
Baker.

Item
1A.



Risk
Factors




Because
our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, there is
substantial uncertainty we will continue operations in which case
you could lose your investment.
               
               
               
               
               
               

Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that
there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing
business for the next 12 months. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty
about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to
cease operations and you could lose your investment.

We lack an
operating history and have losses that we expect to continue into
the future. There is no assurance our future operations will result
in profitable revenues. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues
to operate profitably, we will cease operations and you will lose
your investment.

We were
incorporated on July 14, 2008 and we have not started our proposed
business operations or realized any revenues. We have no operating
history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure
can be made.

Our
ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash
flow is dependent upon:

·
    
our
ability to develop and continually update a functional,
user-friendly website;

·
    
our
ability to procure and maintain on commercially reasonable terms
relationships with third parties to develop and maintain

·
    
our
website, network infrastructure, and transaction processing
systems;

·
    
our
ability to identify and pursue mediums through which we will be
able to market our products;

·
    
our
ability to attract customers to our website;

·
    
our
ability to generate revenues through sales on our website;
and

·
    
our
ability to manage growth by managing administrative
overhead.

Based upon
current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future
periods because we will be incurring expenses and not generating
revenues. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in
generating revenues in the future.

We may be
unable to protect the intellectual property rights that we
have.

Randall A.
Baker, our sole officer and director, developed the concepts behind
the business plan. Mr. Baker assigned any intellectual property
rights that he may have had in that line to us. While Mr. Baker did
not believe that website plan infringed on the intellectual
property rights of third parties, Mr. Baker did not take any steps
such as copyright or trademark protection to protect his
intellectual property rights, nor did he conduct any investigation
to see if the website plan infringed on the intellectual property
rights of third parties. We have not conducted any investigation to
see if the website plan infringes on the intellectual property
rights of others. We have also not taken any further steps to
protect our intellectual property rights in the website designer do
we intend to do so until after we receive the proceeds from the
offering and start our operations.

Mr. Baker
is under no contractual obligation to Western Lucrative to continue
to develop new web products nor is he under any contractual
obligation to assign his intellectual property rights in any new
lines to Western Lucrative.

We do not
intend to use any person other than Mr. Baker as a source of
concepts for new lines to offer on our website.

We intend
to rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret
protection and non-disclosure agreements with employees and
third-party service providers to establish and protect the
intellectual property rights that we have in the products we
manufacture and distribute. There can be no assurance that our
competitors will not independently develop products that are
substantially equivalent or superior to ours. There also can be no
assurance that the measures we adopt to protect our intellectual
property rights will be adequate to do so. The ability of our
competitors to develop products or other intellectual property
rights equivalent or superior to ours or that our inability to
enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material
adverse affect our results of operation.

Though we
do not believe that any of the products will infringe on the
intellectual property rights of third parties in any material
respect, there can be no assurance that third parties will not
claim infringement by us with respect to the products. Any such
claim, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in
costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to
enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or
licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms
acceptable to us or at all, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Changing
consumer preferences will require periodic product
introduction.

As a
result of changing consumer preferences, many websites are
successfully marketed for a limited period of time. There can be no
assurance that any of our food and bakery products continue to be
popular for a period of time. Our success will be dependent upon
our ability to develop new and improved product lines. Our failure
to introduce new sites and product lines and to achieve and sustain
market acceptance and to produce acceptable margins could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

We face
intense competition and our inability to successfully compete with
our competitors will have a material adverse effect on our results
of operation.

The
landscape design industry is highly competitive.  Many of our
competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand
recognition, broader product lines and greater financial resources
and advertising budgets than we do. Many of our competitors offer
similar products or alternatives to our products. We intend to rely
solely on concepts and other intellectual property developed by
Randall A. Baker, our sole officer and director. There can be no
assurance that we will procure an on-line retail market that will
be available to support the sites we will offer or allow us to seek
expansion. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
compete effectively in this marketplace.

Intellectual
property claims against us can be costly and could impair our
business. Other parties may assert infringement or unfair
competition claims against us. We cannot predict whether third
parties will assert claims of infringement against us, or whether
any future assertions or prosecutions will harm our business. If we
are forced to defend against any such claims, whether they are with
or without merit or are determined in our favor, then we may face
costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel,
or product shipment delays. As a result of such a dispute, we may
have to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or
licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if
required, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
If there is a successful claim of product infringement against us
and we are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license
the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, it could
impair our business.

If we do
not attract customers to our website on cost-effective terms, we
will not make a profit, which ultimately will result in a cessation
of operations.

Our
success depends on our ability to attract retail customers to our
website on cost-effective terms. Our strategy to attract customers
to our website, which has not been formalized or implemented,
includes viral marketing, the practice of generating "buzz" among
Internet users in our products through the developing and
maintaining weblogs or "blogs", online journals that are updated
frequently and available to the public, postings on online
communities such as Yahoo!(R) Groups and amateur websites such as
YouTube.com, and other methods of getting Internet users to refer
others to our website by e-mail or word of mouth; search engine
optimization, marketing our website via search engines by
purchasing sponsored placement in search results; and entering into
affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to
increase our access to Internet consumers. We expect to rely on
viral marketing as the primary source of traffic to our website,
with search engine optimization and affiliate marketing as
secondary sources. Our marketing strategy may not be enough to
attract sufficient traffic to our website. If we are unsuccessful
at attracting a sufficient amount of traffic to our website, our
ability to get customers and our financial condition will be
harmed.

To date we
do not have any customers. We cannot guarantee that we will ever
have any customers. Even if we obtain customers, there is no
guarantee that we will generate a profit. If we cannot generate a
profit, we will have to suspend or cease operations.

We will be
dependent on third parties to develop and maintain our website,
network infrastructure, and transaction processing systems; design
(based on concepts developed by our sole officer and director); and
fulfill a number of customer service and other retail functions. If
such parties are unwilling or unable to continue providing these
services, our business could be severely harmed.

We will
rely on third parties to develop and maintain our website, network
infrastructure, and transaction processing systems; design (based
on concepts developed by Randall A. Baker, our sole officer and
director) To date we have not entered into any formal relationship
with any third parties to provide these services. Our success will
depend on our ability to build and maintain relationships with such
third party service providers on commercially reasonable terms. If
we are unable to build and maintain such relationships on
commercially reasonable terms, we will have to suspend or cease
operations. Even if we are able to build and maintain such
relationships, if these parties are unable to deliver products on a
timely basis, our customers could become dissatisfied and decline
to make future purchases. If our customers become dissatisfied with
the services provided by these third parties, our reputation and
the Western Lucrative brand could suffer.

We will
depend on third-party delivery services to deliver our products to
our customers on a timely and consistent basis.

Our
operating results will depend on our website, network
infrastructure, and transaction processing systems. Capacity
restraints or systems failures would harm our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

We have
not developed our website, network infrastructure, or transaction
processing systems, and we intend to use the proceeds from this
offering to do so as described in the "Use of Proceeds" section of
this prospectus. We will have to suspend or cease operations if we
are unable to develop our website, network infrastructure, and
transaction processing systems.

If we are
able to develop our website, network infrastructure, and
transaction processing systems, any systems interruptions that
result in the unavailability of our website or reduced performance
of our transaction systems would reduce our transaction volume and
the attractiveness of our services and would seriously harm our
business, operating results, and financial condition. Our
transaction processing systems and network infrastructure may be
unable to accommodate increases in traffic to our website. We may
be unable to project accurately the rate or timing of traffic
increases or successfully upgrade our systems and infrastructure to
accommodate future traffic levels on our website. In addition, we
may be unable to upgrade or expand our transaction processing
systems in an affective and timely manner or to integrate any newly
developed or purchased functionality with our then existing
systems. Any inability to do so may cause unanticipated system
disruptions, slower response times, degradation in levels of
customer service, impaired quality and speed of order fulfillment
or delays in reporting accurate financial information.

We are
solely dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to
initiate our operations, the proceeds of which may be insufficient
to achieve revenues. If we need additional funds and can't raise
them we will have to terminate our operations.

We have
not started our business operations. If we need additional funds
and can't raise the money, we will have to cease
operations.

If we do
not make a profit, we may have to suspend or cease
operations.

Because we
are small and do not have much capital, we must limit the marketing
of our website. The website is how we will generate revenue.
Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be
able to attract enough suppliers and customers to operate
profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend
or cease operations.

Because
our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to
our operations, our operations may be sporadic which may result in
periodic interruptions or suspensions of operations. This activity
could prevent us from developing websites and attracting customers
and result in a lack of revenues that may cause us to suspend or
cease operations.

Our sole
officer and director, Randall A. Baker, will only be devoting
limited time to our operations. Mr. Baker will be devoting
approximately 10 hours per week of his time to our operations.
Because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited
time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at
times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be
periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack
of revenues and a possible cessation of operations.

Because
our sole officer and director does not have prior experience in
online marketing, we may have to hire individuals or suspend or
cease operations.

Because
our sole officer and director does not have prior experience in
online marketing, we may have to hire additional experienced
personnel to assist us with our operations. If we need the
additional experienced personnel and we do not hire them, we could
fail in our plan of operations and have to suspend operations or
cease operations.

Because
our sole officer and director does not have prior experience in
financial accounting and the preparation of reports under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we may have to hire individuals
which could result in an expense we are unable to pay.

Because
our sole officer and director does not have prior experience in
financial accounting and the preparation of reports under the
Securities Act of 1934, we may have to hire additional experienced
personnel to assist us with the preparation thereof. If we need the
additional experienced personnel and we do not hire them, we could
fail in our plan of operations and have to suspend operations or
cease operations entirely and you could lose your
investment.

Because we
have only one officer and director who is responsible for our
managerial and organizational structure, in the future, there may
not be effective disclosure and accounting controls to comply with
applicable laws and regulations which could result in fines,
penalties and assessments against us.

We have
only one officer and director. He is responsible for our managerial
and organizational structure which will include preparation of
disclosure and accounting controls under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of
2002. When theses controls are implemented, he will be responsible
for the administration of the controls. Should he not have
sufficient experience, he may be incapable of creating and
implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to
sanctions and fines by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

We are
completely dependent on our sole officer and director to guide our
initial operations, initiate our plan of operations, and provide
financial support. If we lose his services we will have to cease
operations.

Our
success will depend entirely on the ability and resources of Mr.
Baker, our sole officer and director. If we lose the services or
financial support of Mr. Baker, we will cease operations.
Presently, Mr. Baker is committed to providing his time and
financial resources to us. However, Mr. Baker does engage in other
activities and only devotes and will devote a limited amount of
time to our operations.

Risks
Relating to the Internet Industry

Our
success is tied to the continued use of the Internet and the
adequacy of the Internet infrastructure.

Our future
revenues and profits, if any, substantially depend upon the
continued widespread use of the Internet as an effective medium of
business and communication.

Factors
which could reduce the widespread use of the Internet
include:

     
actual or
perceived lack of security of information or privacy
protection;

     
possible
disruptions, computer viruses or other damage to the Internet
servers or to users' computers; and

     
excessive
governmental regulation.

     
Customers
may be unwilling to use the Internet to purchase dating
services.

Our future
depends heavily upon the general public's willingness to use the
Internet as a means to purchase dating services. The demand for and
acceptance of dating services sold over the Internet are highly
uncertain, and most e-commerce businesses have a short track
record. If consumers are unwilling to use the Internet to conduct
business, our business may not develop profitably.

Our
relationships with our customers may be adversely affected if the
security measures that we use to protect their personal
information, such as credit card numbers, are
ineffective.

Any breach
in our website security could expose us to a risk of loss or
litigation and possible liability. We anticipate that we will rely
on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third
parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information.
As a result of advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries
in the field of cryptography or other developments, a compromise or
breach of our security precautions may occur. A compromise in our
proposed security could severely harm our business. A party who is
able to circumvent our proposed security measures could
misappropriate proprietary information, including customer credit
card information, or cause interruptions in the operation of our
website. We may be required to spend significant funds and other
resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to
alleviate problems caused by these breaches. However, protection
may not be available at a reasonable price, or at all. Concerns
regarding the security of e-commerce and the privacy of users may
also inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting
commercial transactions.

Because we
will rely primarily on on-line credit card payment for our
services, we will risk fraudulent credit card transactions; a
failure to adequately control such transactions would harm our net
sales and results of operations because we do not intend to carry
insurance against this risk. We intend to utilize technology to
help us detect the fraudulent use of credit card information.
Nonetheless, we may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with
fraudulent credit card data, even though the associated financial
institution approved payment of the orders. Under current credit
card practices, we will be liable for fraudulent credit card
transactions because we do not intend to obtain a cardholder's
signature. Because we have no operating history, we cannot predict
our future levels of bad-debt expense.

If one or
more states successfully assert that we should collect sales or
other taxes on the sale of the merchandise that we offer for sale
on our website, our business could be harmed.

We do not
intend to collect sales or other similar taxes for physical
shipments of goods into states other than Texas. One or more local,
state or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose sales tax
collection obligations on us and other out-of-state companies that
engage in online commerce. Our business could be adversely affected
if one or more states or any foreign country successfully asserts
that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our
merchandise.

                                                                                 

Existing or future government regulation could harm our
business.

We are
subject to the same federal, state and local laws as other
companies conducting business on the Internet. Today there are
relatively few laws specifically directed towards conducting
business on the Internet. However, due to the increasing popularity
and use of the Internet, many laws and regulations relating to the
Internet are being debated at the state and federal levels. These
laws and regulations could cover issues such as user privacy,
freedom of expression, pricing, fraud, quality of products and
services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and
information security. Applicability to the Internet of existing
laws governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights and
other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and
personal privacy could also harm our business. Current and future
laws and regulations could harm our business, results of operation
and financial condition.

Laws or
regulations relating to privacy and data protection may adversely
affect the growth of our Internet business or our marketing
efforts.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.

Certain
statements in this report and elsewhere (such as in other filings
by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"),
press releases, presentations by the Company of its management and
oral statements) may constitute "forward-looking statements" within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans,"
"believes," "seeks," "estimates," and "should," and variations of
these words and similar expressions, are intended to identify these
forward-looking statements. Actual results may materially differ
from any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or
contribute to such differences include, among others, competitive
pressures and constantly changing technology and market acceptance
of the Company's products and services. The Company undertakes no
obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these
forward-looking statements, which may be made to reflect events or
circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.

Western
Lucrative Enterprises, Inc. was incorporated on July 14, 2008.
 As of the date of this document, we have generated no
revenues and substantial expenses.  This resulted in a net
loss of since inception, which is attributable to general and
administrative expenses.

Since
incorporation, we have financed our operations primarily through
minimal initial capitalization.

To date we
have not implemented our fully planned principal operations.  
 The realization of sales revenues in the next 12 months is
important in the execution of the plan of operations.
 However, we cannot guarantee that it will generate such
growth.  If we do not produce sufficient cash flow to support
our operations over the next 12 months, we may need to raise
additional capital by issuing capital stock in exchange for cash in
order to continue as a going concern.  There are no formal or
informal agreements to attain such financing.  We cannot
assure any investor that, if needed, sufficient financing can be
obtained or, if obtained, that it will be on reasonable terms.
 Without realization of additional capital, it would be
unlikely for operations to continue.

Western
Lucrative Enterprises, Inc.’s management does not expect to
conduct any research and development.

Western
Lucrative Enterprises, Inc. currently does not own any significant
plant or equipment that it would seek to purchase or sell in the
near future.

Our
management does not anticipate any significant changes in the
number of employees in the next 12 months.  Currently, we
believe the services provided by our officers and directors are
sufficient at this time.

We have
not paid for expenses on behalf of any director.
 Additionally, we believe that this practice will not
materially change.
