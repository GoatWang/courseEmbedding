DePrince, Race & Zollo Inc.
Home › DePrince, Race & Zollo Inc.
DePrince, Race & Zollo Inc. is an institutional asset management firm specializing in value investing. Its goal is to provide superior performance by consistently executing its proprietary Value Income Methodology. The firm believes that a portfolio of undervalued stocks that pay dividends and have imminent fundamental catalysts will provide the opportunity for superior total return with down market protection. The Winter Park, Florida-based firm has been a registered investment advisor since 1995. 


"We look for companies exhibiting three equally-balanced factors including above-average dividend yield, low long-term relative valuation and a fundamental catalyst."
- DePrince, Race & Zollo Inc.

Dividend-paying investments may not experience the same price appreciation as non-dividend paying instruments, dividend-issuing companies may choose not to pay a dividend, or the dividend may be less than what is anticipated.
