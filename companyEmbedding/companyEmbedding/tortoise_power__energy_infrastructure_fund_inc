FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Tortoise Capital Advisors - News Release








 






Tortoise Capital Advisors Announces Proposed Merger of Three MLP Closed-End Funds


	LEAWOOD, Kan.-- January 28, 2014 (BUSINESS WIRE)--Tortoise Capital Advisors today announced the Board of Directors of Tortoise’s closed-end funds approved a proposal to merge three of Tortoise’s MLP closed-end funds: Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Corp. (NYSE:TYG), Tortoise Energy Capital Corp. (NYSE:TYY) and Tortoise North American Energy Corp. (NYSE:TYN). Subject to stockholder approval, TYY and TYN common stockholders will be issued TYG common stock and TYG would acquire substantially all of the assets and liabilities of TYY and TYN.

















Acquiring Fund







Acquired Funds



					Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Corp. (TYG)







					Tortoise Energy Capital Corp. (TYY)











					Tortoise North American Energy Corp. (TYN)

















	The Boards of Directors of TYG, TYY and TYN and Tortoise determined that the proposed mergers are in the best interests of each fund and its stockholders. The funds have similar investment strategies and portfolios focusing primarily on midstream energy infrastructure master limited partnerships (MLPs) and similar investment objectives that seek to provide stockholders a high level of total return, with an emphasis on current distributions. The combined fund will continue to pursue these investment strategies and objectives. Additionally, the mergers are expected to result in several benefits to TYG, TYY and TYN stockholders, including:


		•  anticipated accretion to distributable cash flow;

		•  the opportunity for enhanced long-term market liquidity;

		•  anticipated cost savings through a lower effective management fee and increased economies of scale; and

		•  greater financial flexibility through a larger balance sheet.





		The transaction value will be based on the relative net asset values of each fund. It is currently expected that the mergers will be concluded in the second calendar quarter of 2014, subject to obtaining TYG, TYY and TYN stockholder approval, compliance with all regulatory requirements and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.


	A Questions & Answers document regarding the merger proposal can be found here or by visiting the closed-end fund section of www.tortoiseadvisors.com. More information on the proposed mergers will be contained in the proxy materials expected to be filed in the coming weeks. TYG plans to file in the near future with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a joint proxy statement/prospectus on Form N-14 8C with respect to the mergers, and each fund expects to mail a definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus to each of its stockholders that will contain information about the proposed mergers following a review period with the SEC.

When filed with the SEC, the joint proxy statement/prospectus and other documents filed by the funds will be available for free at the SEC’s Web site, http://www.sec.gov. Stockholders can also obtain copies of the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus, when available, for free by dialing (866) 362-9331. Stockholders are urged to read the definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety when available as it will contain important information about the proposed mergers.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This data is provided for information only and is not intended for trading purposes. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. After the initial public offering, shares are sold on the open market through a stock exchange. As with any other stock, total return and market value will fluctuate so that an investment, when sold, may be worth more or less than its original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only. Due to market volatility, current performance may be lower or higher than the figures shown. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value. Leverage creates risks that may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market value.
All investments involve risk, including possible loss of principal. You should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For this and other important information, please refer to the most recent closed-end fund prospectus supplement, if applicable, and its accompanying prospectus. Read it carefully before investing. 
Nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell any shares of a fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

Determining distributions to stockholders
Our portfolio generates cash flow from which we pay distributions to stockholders. Our Board of Directors has adopted a policy of declaring what it believes to be sustainable distributions. In determining distributions, our Board of Directors considers a number of current and anticipated factors, including, among others, distributable cash flow (DCF), realized and unrealized gains, leverage amounts and rates, current and deferred taxes payable, and potential volatility in returns from our investments and the overall market. While the Board of Directors considers many factors in determining distributions to stockholders, particular emphasis is given to DCF and distribution coverage. Distribution coverage is DCF divided by distributions paid to stockholders. Over the long term, we expect to distribute substantially all of our DCF to holders of common stock. Our Board of Directors reviews the distribution rate quarterly, and may adjust the quarterly distribution throughout the year.
DCF is income received from investments, less expenses. The income from investments includes the amount received by us as cash or paid-in-kind distributions from MLPs, affiliates of MLPs and common stock, and dividend payments on short-term investments. The total expenses include current or anticipated operating expenses, leverage costs and current income taxes. Current income taxes include taxes paid on net investment income of the Company, in addition to foreign taxes, if any. Taxes incurred from realized gains on the sale of investments, expected tax benefits and deferred taxes are not included in DCF.
2016 distributions to common stockholders were approximately 86% qualified dividend income and 14% return of capital. Tax characterization of 2017 distributions will be determined after the completion of TYG's fiscal year. For more details, see TYG's complete distribution and tax information here.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This data is provided for information only and is not intended for trading purposes. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. After the initial public offering, shares are sold on the open market through a stock exchange. As with any other stock, total return and market value will fluctuate so that an investment, when sold, may be worth more or less than its original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only. Due to market volatility, current performance may be lower or higher than the figures shown. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value. Leverage creates risks that may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market value.
All investments involve risk, including possible loss of principal. You should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For this and other important information, please refer to the most recent closed-end fund prospectus supplement, if applicable, and its accompanying prospectus. Read it carefully before investing. 
Nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell any shares of a fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Nothing contained in this communication constitutes tax, legal or investment advice. Investors must consult their tax adviser or legal counsel for advice and information concerning their particular situation.
