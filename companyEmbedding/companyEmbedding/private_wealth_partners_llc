Supporting Our Community
"The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.  Let us move forward with strong and active faith." -Franklin Delano Roosevelt
We believe that philanthropy and community engagement is essential to keeping communities, people and businesses growing prosperously. All of us at Private Wealth Partners dedicate our time and resources to many outstanding organizations.
 
            4th Annual Clays 4 A Cause!
              Private Wealth Partners, LLC sponsored the 4th Annual Clays 4 A Cause sporting clays tournament, benefiting Friends of the Light House Shelter, at Pintail Point in Queenstown on September 30th.  The morning kicked off with over 70 shooters competing on a ten-stand sporting clays course, and finished with a catered barbecue lunch and awards ceremony.  Top Shooter honors went to Kevin Jones who broke 46 out of 50 targets.  Mark Murphy and Doug Wilson co-chaired the event, which raised more than $10,000.
 
 
 
   Royal Blue Club
     Established in 1989, the Royal Blue Club is a registered 501(c)(3) tax-deductible nonprofit organization devoted to fostering excellence in St. Mary’s High School Athletics through financial and booster support.
 
 
 
 
 
    Chesapeake BaySavers
      Chesapeake BaySavers is an Annapolis-based non-profit, environmental organization whose mission is to restore the health of the Chesapeake Bay through legislative efforts, community outreach, and hands-on, environmental education programs for Maryland youth. Chesapeake BaySavers is dedicated to restoring all of the Bay’s natural resources and believes one key way to rebuild the Bay’s health is to revitalize its population of oysters — a species known for its water-filtering capabilities. Chesapeake BaySavers encourages a diverse population of Marylanders to become stewards of a healthy Chesapeake Bay.
 
 
 

Young Audiences
Young Audiences transforms the lives and education of our youth through the arts by connecting educators, professional artists, and communities. We provide artistically-excellent programs, expertise, and resources to ensure opportunities for all students across the state of Maryland.
 
 

Daughters of the American Revolution

Fish For A Cure
Proceeds from Fish For A Cure benefit the Anne Arundel Medical Center's Geaton and JoAnn DeCesaris Cancer Institute.  It was started in 2007 by a group of friends and business associates looking for an opportunity to enjoy the beauty of the Chesapeake Bay, fulfill their passion for fishing, and to have fun all for a worthy cause.

 Everyone knows that getting to the top of the mountain is only half the battle. Mountaineering
experts also know that comprehensive planning for a successful descent can be the most critical phase of the trip.  The same can be said for successful
retirement planning.

mountain) can leave you exposed and unprepared for the risk of outliving your resources.
 
At Innovative Wealth Partners, we are experts at helping you to plan with the end in mind. After all, we know the primary reason for saving today is to enjoy a
comfortable and secure retirement lifestyle tomorrow.  That is why we are dedicated to helping you get there.
 
Our Innovative Approach takes a holistic long-term perspective and artfully weaves disparate elements of your financial life into a coordinated vision for your
successful future.  Using time-honored principals, we will help you efficiently optimize your resources to significantly increase retirement income streams while
enhancing flexibility and minimizing risk.
