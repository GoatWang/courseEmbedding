100 Breaths Meditation - An easy to learn meditation system.









	Mainstream Meditation
	




















Below are two new versions of the 100 Breaths meditation, that have been set to music to guide your breathing. You can stream them online or download them. The first version is guided, where I give instructions along with the music. The 2nd version is music only. Try the guided meditation a couple of times until you get the hang of it. Then, take off your training wheels and do the unguided version on your own. Try it twice a day for 30 days and see how you feel!
