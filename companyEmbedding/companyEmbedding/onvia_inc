	About Onvia






Leading sales intelligence and acceleration in the B2G marketplace
Onvia provides enterprise, mid-market and small business customers with the most comprehensive set of federal, state and local government contracting leads.
Our clients grow their sales pipelines with access to bids, RFPs and future spending data, along with agency contacts, competitor information and market analytics – all backed by our smart search technology, CRM integration and expert support.
Resolving the friction in this $2 trillion market, we create mutual value for public and private sectors, taxpayers and society at large.














	The Big Picture





Transforming complexity into opportunity and civic dividend

























B2G Intelligence System
Government procurement moves $2 trillion worth of contracts. This B2G marketplace is vital to our communities, and stimulates opportunities for businesses of all sizes, but it is also extremely fragmented and complex to navigate. We help companies and agencies conquer that challenge with access to indispensable commerce intelligence.






Resolving B2G Data Fragmentation
In the space of B2G commerce, you’re dealing with vast amounts of fragmented and unstructured data – tens of thousands of federal, state, local and educational agencies publish millions of procurement-related documents every year.






Assisting Buyers and Sellers
Businesses are challenged to wade through that content to create timely, informed and competitive responses to government agencies. Procurement professionals are too overwhelmed to author meaningful solicitations to attract favorable contractors and bids. We help them solve those challenges.






Curating Data for Value
Onvia curates this complex information into meaningful, indispensable commerce intelligence. Our Data Value Chain (DVC) engages state-of-the-art technologies for high-volume data capture, normalization algorithms, proprietary ontology, machine tagging, natural language searches, and system integration.






Commerce Realization and Civic Dividend
B2G buyers and sellers become more agile with access to data about: agencies and decision makers profiles, short and long-term project leads, award records, vendors and channels activity. Their gains in performance accrue to a more efficient marketplace, with civic dividends to communities, taxpayers and society at large.






The Opportunity Advantage
In a class of its own, our B2G Intelligence System builds on our technology innovations and domain expertise. It connects business and government with the highest volume of quality leads, fast-tracked operational workflows and forward-looking data for strategic decisions.

Here you find driven professionals advancing commerce intelligence technology to resolve the market’s friction and bring civic dividends to society at large
Careers at Onvia














	Inspired by the Higher Civic Good





Advancing commerce and the common good
























B2G Magnitude Through our Lenses
At Onvia, we see the B2G marketplace beyond its vast size and challenging complexity. We see its vital importance to citizens and society. Government contracting stimulates nearly every sector of our economy. Its commercial transactions fulfill essential investments in infrastructure and services – which in turn, contribute to communities’ safety and prosperity.






Enabling Performance and Participation
Our purpose goes beyond assisting buyers and sellers with data, agility and foresight. Here, we are resolved to make B2G more efficient – and compelling to more participating vendors. Our network include agency partners and business clients – from large enterprises to the small and minority-owned businesses, eligible for government contracting goals or quotas.






Optimized Infrastructure and Services
Government procurement teams are under the pressure to meet civic and fiscal demands – even under restricted resources. We help them save time, improve response rates, understand the market and network with like-minded professionals. The work they do reflects in improved infrastructure and services related to public safety, environment, healthcare, education and more.






Effect on Communities’ Prosperity
Conversations about government contracting can easily invite predispositions about market inefficiency and political orientation. Setting those aside, it’s worth shedding light on the market’s vital essence. The purchases under consideration enable agencies to: run schools and hospitals, build bridges and energy plants, equip police and fire departments, maintain vehicles and monuments, clean rivers and parks, and innovate with digital technology and smart urbanization.






Citizens and Taxpayers Care
The effect of B2G procurement is all around us. Procurement in all levels of public sector – federal, state, local and public schools – has significant impact on our environment and quality of life. As citizens and taxpayers, we all want to see our communities prosper, and our tax dollars go the distance. That’s good for business. That’s good for all.

Management Discussion
Onvia's goal is to become the leading commerce intelligence system at the center of the business-to-government, or B2G, marketplace. We believe that by building trusted connections between businesses and governments we can make this extremely large, yet fragmented market more effective and efficient. To create these trusted connections, we have established three objectives upon which we focus our efforts:

Increase our content coverage to become the authority in B2G commerce intelligence and analysis  
Leverage our proprietary technology, including industry ontologies, business rules and search capabilities to consistently deliver highly targeted, proprietary data 
Develop workflow tools and integrations to help businesses efficiently qualify and pursue revenue opportunities and to help agencies procure more effectively.

In 2016 we made good progress against these three goals. First, we successfully launched Onvia Exchange which provides participating agencies with the data they need to connect with vendors and improve their procurement process. We are pleased with the level of agency adoption to date and participating agencies should begin to provide new and unique procurement content to Onvia Exchange later this year, further expanding Onvia's already robust content coverage. This expanded content coverage will allow us to further enhance the insight and analysis we provide to the B2G market. Second, all Onvia clients were migrated to Onvia 7's tag-based search paradigm which organizes procurement data using advanced data science, ontologies and machine learning to provide more accurate and targeted insights to our clients. In addition, Onvia 7 automates a large part of the data curation process, which provides the capacity to efficiently process significantly larger content volumes. Finally, we improved our workflow enablement tools to help clients maximize the value of our information. We released data integration into two leading CRM systems in 2016, Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics, and made significant progress on our Onvia 8 workflow release scheduled throughout 2017.  
In January 2017 we announced that Russ Mann joined Onvia as President and Chief Executive Officer effective January 30th. Russ has a strong background in accelerating top line revenue growth, innovating market changing products and creating value for shareholders.  
"I have been working as part of the Onvia team for nearly a month, and I am more excited than ever about our opportunity to dynamically change the B2G marketplace," stated Mr. Mann. "We have the right team in place, an extremely loyal client base, proprietary technologies and a robust database of procurement content. Our foundation is extremely strong from which to innovate new solutions, reduce friction in the procurement process and create value for governments, businesses, shareholders and society at large. We will discuss any new strategic goals for 2017 and beyond at a later date."
Fourth Quarter and Annual 2016 Results
Subscription revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 grew 7% to $5.9 million compared to the same period in 2015. Throughout 2016 we made significant investments in product development and content marketing programs to accelerate revenue growth and create leverage from our business model. These investments began to contribute to revenue growth in the second half of 2016. For the year ended December 2016, subscription revenue grew 6% over 2015. 
ACV for Strategic Accounts grew $1.4 million, or 8%, in the fourth quarter of 2016 over the same period last year. The growth in ACV primarily reflects improved results in acquisition sales as a result of improved sales execution and content marketing programs. Small Business (legacy accounts) represents clients outside of our strategic target market that have been subscribers since before 2011, when we originally transitioned away from the small business market. Total ACV grew 5% in Q4 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, dollar retention was 89%, compared to 88% in the same period last year. Dollar retention is a measurement of how effectively the Client Success team has retained, achieved price increases and expanded existing subscription contracts. This measurement can fluctuate from period to period due to the mix of first year and tenured clients expiring in each period, as well as the volume of pricing and contract expansions in a particular. For more information about dollar retention, see "Key Metric Definitions" below. 
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 11% to $5.9 million from $5.3 million in the same period of 2015. The increase in comparative periods is primarily due to investments in our product team to support Onvia 8 and Onvia Exchange and in leadership roles in sales and marketing and due to accelerated amortization of internal software costs of $241,000 (explained further below). In addition, general and administrative costs associated with our CEO transition of approximately $201,000 were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
2016 operating expenses increased 8%, or $1.6 million, to $22.5 million compared to $20.9 million in 2015, due to the growth related initiatives in sales, marketing and product development discussed above. 2016 expenses also include the acceleration of internal use software amortization of $446,000 and CEO transition costs of $487,000.  We expect to incur additional transition costs in the first half of 2017.
Our current product roadmap is focused on improving client workflows and the usability of our platform. These new enhancements as part of our Onvia 8 release will replace existing processes and features of software assets currently capitalized on our balance sheet. We determined that the estimated useful lives of the affected capitalized costs must be shortened to coincide with the estimated release of the new enhanced features and functions. We have accelerated the amortization of $962,000 in internal software costs beginning in the third quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of 2017. 
Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, and non-cash stock-based compensation) for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 increased to $602,000 from $513,000 in Q4 2015.  Adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2016 was flat with the prior year at $1.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 and 2015 does not include the full incentive compensation that could have been earned had the company achieved the results required to fund executive compensation arrangements. In addition, due to the Company's small size, increased variable sales costs and investment may exceed the incremental revenue generated each period, which could negatively impact short term Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.
At December 31, 2016, cash, cash equivalents and available for sale investments increased to $7.1 million compared to $6.8 million at the end of 2015. In December 2015, the Company repurchased 349,497 shares of common stock at a price of $3.00 per share for an aggregate cost of $1,048,491. The repurchased shares are held by the Company as treasury stock and are excluded from outstanding shares for the purposes of earnings per share calculations.  
Conference Call
Onvia will hold a conference call later today (February 28, 2017) to discuss its fourth quarter and year end results. Onvia's CEO, Russ Mann, and CFO, Cameron Way, will host the call starting at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. A question and answer session will follow management's presentation.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information 
Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the company's liquidity. Onvia defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income / (loss) before interest expense and other non-cash financing costs; interest and miscellaneous income; taxes; depreciation; amortization; and non-cash stock-based compensation.  Other companies (including Onvia's competitors) may define Adjusted EBITDA differently. Onvia presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes Adjusted EBITDA to be an important supplemental measure of performance that is commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in similar industries and size. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. It may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Onvia nor is it intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. See "Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA" below for further information on this non-GAAP measure and for a reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated.

Key Metric Definitions 
Onvia also supplements its financial statements in this release and in its annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with a calculation of Annual Contract Value (ACV) and dollar retention.  Onvia presents these metrics in aggregate and separately for the Strategic Accounts and Small Business (legacy accounts) sales channels. These metrics are not financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or any other financial measures so calculated. Management uses this information as a basis for planning and forecasting core business activity for future periods and believes it is useful in understanding the results of its operations.  
ACV represents the annualized aggregate revenue value of all subscription contracts as of the end of the quarter. ACV is driven by Annual Contract Value per Client (ACVC) and the number of clients. Most of Onvia's revenues are generated from subscription contracts, which are typically prepaid and have a minimum term of one year, with revenues recognized ratably over the term of the subscription. Onvia also receives revenue from multi-year content distribution partnerships, stand-alone management reports, document download services, and list rental services, which are not included in the calculation of ACV.  
Dollar retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of subscription contracts renewed, including the value of contract upgrades, during the most recent twelve-month period by the total value of subscription contracts expiring over the same period. Dollar retention measures the percentage of dollars retained from the population of expiring contracts over a twelve month period.  
Strategic Accounts are those clients from a target market that are believed to have a long term strategic interest in the state and local government market. Small Business (legacy accounts) clients are primarily long term customers that were acquired prior to a change in go-to-market strategy in 2011.  Clients that subscribe to our new self-service Small Business solution are not included in Small Business (legacy accounts).
Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to the historical information, this release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "believe," "intend," "plan," "expect," "should," "indicate" or the negative of these and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements contained in this release may relate to, but are not limited to, statements regarding Onvia's future results of operations, Onvia's future financial flexibility and future cash flows and Onvia's future product and content offerings. Such statements are based on current expectations that involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual events to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements:  Onvia fails to increase and retain contract value of customers; Onvia fails to execute properly on new products, or customers fail to adopt these products or services; Onvia's investment in the Onvia platform and new content fail to improve sales penetration and client retention rates; and changes made to Onvia's technology infrastructure fail to handle the increased demands on its infrastructure caused by increasing network traffic and the volume of aggregated data. Additional information on factors that may impact these forward-looking statements can be found in the "Business," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Risk Factors" sections, as applicable, in Onvia's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year December 31, 2015.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release. Factors or events that could cause Onvia's actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for Onvia to anticipate all of them.  Onvia assumes no obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligation) to update any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as may be required by law.

Onvia, Inc. is an American government business intelligence company with 180 employees and annual revenue of US $21.1 million. Onvia offers a number of business-to-business software products, including Onvia Business Builder, a government leads and relationship manager; Onvia Navigator, a database of government contracts; and the Onvia Guide, which provides push notifications of government business opportunities.
Onvia is located in Seattle, Washington, USA.
History[edit]
Onvia was founded in 1996 by 25-year-old Canadian entrepreneur Glenn Ballman[1] as a one-stop shop for small business owners, initially selling over 25,000 office supplies on its website, Onvia.com. Onvia raised US $70 million in early rounds of financing,[2] and went public on March 1, 2000 on the NASDAQ [3] where it raised US $235 million. In August 2000 the company was awarded "Hottest Startup in Canada" by the Toronto Board of Trade and Profit Magazine.[4] In August 2000 Onvia acquired Globe-1, a business-to-government portal, turning the company's focus away from e-commerce to the government-bid space. Onvia then used its cash reserves to buy competitors, including DemandStar in March 2001.[5]
In 2005, Onvia released Onvia Business Builder, a tool allowing subscribers to research historical and real-time data on individual government contract opportunities [6] Onvia continued to focus on the business to government market until the launch of their private sector tool, Onvia Planning and Construction, in February 2008.[7] In the third quarter of 2007, Onvia reported net income for the first time, but has lost money in all but that one quarter, according to its SEC filings.[8] Currently, Onvia's database includes over 4.5 million procurement records connected to over 275,000 companies from across 78,000 U.S. government agencies. Private sector data covers over 127,000 opportunities and contact data for more than 24,000 officials on the local and state level [9]
In early 2009, Onvia launched www.recovery.gov, with the stated goal of bringing increased transparency and accountability to economic recovery spending. The site features real-time data, maps, and graphs detailing the spending activity associated with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act [10]
