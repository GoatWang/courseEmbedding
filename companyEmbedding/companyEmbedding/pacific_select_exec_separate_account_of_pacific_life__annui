Pacific Odyssey Fees Fact Sheet






Investors should carefully consider a variable annuity's risks, charges, limitations, and expenses, as well as the risks, charges, expenses, and investment goals of the underlying investment options. This and other information about Pacific Life are provided in the product and underlying fund prospectuses. These prospectuses should be read carefully before investing.
The value of the variable investment options will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Annuity withdrawals and other distributions of taxable amounts, including death benefit payouts, will be subject to ordinary income tax. For nonqualified contracts, an additional 3.8% federal tax may apply on net investment income. If withdrawals and other distributions are taken prior to age 59½, an additional 10% federal tax may apply. A withdrawal charge also may apply. Withdrawals will reduce the contract value and the value of the death benefits, and also may reduce the value of any optional benefits.
Pacific Life is a product provider. It is not a fiduciary and therefore does not give advice or make recommendations regarding insurance or investment products. Only an advisor who is also a fiduciary is required to advise if the product purchase and any subsequent action taken with regard to the product are in their client's best interest.
Check the background of your financial professional on FINRA's BrokerCheck.
Variable insurance products are distributed by Pacific Select Distributors, LLC (member FINRA & SIPC), a subsidiary of Pacific Life Insurance Company (Newport Beach, CA) and an affiliate of Pacific Life & Annuity Company, and are available through licensed third parties.

Pacific Select Exec IV Powers Up Life Insurance Protection with Feature That Can Help Stabilize Market Volatility | Business Wire
























































Pacific Select Exec IV Powers Up Life Insurance Protection with 
      Feature That Can Help Stabilize Market Volatility






August 26, 2008 01:03 PM Eastern Daylight Time



ALISO VIEJO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today’s equities market is a roller coaster 
      ride and even if retirement seems way off on the horizon, many people 
      may wonder how their plans might be affected if the same circumstances 
      coincide with their retirement. Pacific Select Exec IV,1 
      a new variable universal life insurance policy from Pacific Life 
      Insurance Company, combines the power of life insurance death benefit 
      protection with innovative features that can help address prolonged 
      market volatility and downturns.
    


      Policyowners who purchase the product’s 
      Minimum Earnings Benefit Rider2 can help 
      protect their life insurance policy’s 
      accumulated value from losses during prolonged market downturns. The 
      rider establishes a minimum level of earnings for a maturity period 
      between 10 and 15 years. The policyowner chooses the maturity period. 
      They can also extend the maturity period for another 10 to 15 years at 
      an additional cost each time the rider matures until the insured reaches 
      age 70.
    

“Pacific Select Exec IV offers financial 
      protection for families in the event of an early death plus the 
      potential to supplement retirement income later,” 
      explained Alyce Peterson, vice president of marketing services for 
      Pacific Life’s Life Insurance Division. “The 
      product’s combination of riders, diverse 
      variable investment options and services can help steady policy 
      performance in both calm and rough markets.”





            Pacific Select Exec IV features:
          




           
        



          -- A choice of allocation approaches ranging from time-saving 
          convenience to hands-on selection with:
        



          -- Five asset allocation models offered by the Portfolio 
          Optimization service
        



          -- Six target date funds
        



          -- Or the 57 variable investment options including target date funds 
          and two fixed account options.
        




            -- No lapse guarantee benefits for up to 20 years with the 
            No-Lapse Guarantee Rider - Short Term Guarantee.3 
            Depending on the issue age, this rider provides a no lapse benefit 
            for up to 20 years when the no lapse premium is paid.
          




          -- Direct deposit of pre-scheduled policy distributions with the 
          Automated Income Option service when retirement occurs.
        




            -- Specialized tools through Planned Performance Tracking(R) 
            so life insurance professional can review "Planned" versus "Where 
            We Are" policy performance with the policyowner.
