Asset Management Services | Murphy Pohlad Asset Management

























































My spouse and I each have student loans from our professional training. What are the trade-offs between paying off the debt versus building an investment portfolio?  We just inherited money from my parents.  We want to be good stewards of their generosity.  Is there a firm that will integrate our perspective on sustainability when managing our investments?  Over the years, my finances have evolved and now I have accounts all over the place. I need a clear picture of what I own.  I want to own a portfolio of high quality companies and generate some dividend income. It is important to me to know that if I have a question, I can call and talk to the person who is managing my portfolio.  Between my CEO role and board service, I don’t have time to allocate to manage my personal assets. I’m looking for a team that will listen to my objectives and execute on those plans while collaborating with my CPA and lawyer.  For many years, we have focused on our careers and raising our children.  Most of our investments are concentrated in the stock of the companies we work for.  Are we too heavily invested in our employer’s stock?  I just sold my business and I will be meeting my expense needs with the proceeds of the sale.  I’m looking for someone I can trust and collaborate with to make a plan.  Someone who will tell me what they really think, not just what they think I want to hear.  My spouse and I want to retire. Throughout our careers, we have budgeted our expenses against our paychecks, but now we need a plan that demonstrates how our retirement will work. Do we have enough money to retire?  In the past, my spouse always handled all the finances and now I am in a position where I need to handle it myself.  Do I have enough money and how will all of this work?   
Services  Holistic and effective asset management isn’t just picking investments, it’s thinking broadly about risk, sustainability, succession and tax efficiency. At Murphy Pohlad Asset Management, we provide you and other members of your team with a comprehensive set of ancillary services to make sure your strategy matches your goals.

Portfolio Management Services | Murphy Pohlad Asset Management





















































Portfolio Management


To know how to invest, you must know the client.Tom Pohlad
Equity Strategy
Client portfolios generally include investments in equities including individual common stocks or funds which own individual common stocks.
With individual common stocks, we focus on owning high quality companies managed by leaders we trust.  Our research centers on cash flow and valuation.
With equity investment funds, we research managers, review performance and analyze the fund’s portfolio.  
Fixed Income Strategy
In many interest rate environments, we will manage the fixed income component of a portfolio by building bond ladders comprised of bonds which mature on a regular basis or investing in fixed income funds.
If we believe that intermediate and long term interest rates do not offer favorable investment return potential, we will either build shorter term bond ladders or invest the fixed income capital in short duration investments, including cash.

Company Description


Murphy Pohlad Asset Management's (MPAM) equity strategy seeks to invest in individually owned common stocks of high quality companies that are managed by leaders they respect, at a price that provides a path to a favorable investment return. These companies exhibit strong market positions supported by an ongoing competitive advantage. Their financial attributes include a strong balance sheet and business operations which generate high levels of cash flow after funding capital expenditures and any acquisition activity. MPAM believes that dividends are an important component of investment return and they focus on owning companies which pay annual dividends to their shareholders.The firm's fixed-income strategy seeks to preserve the investment principal of the fixed-income capital while generating current income in the form of interest. In most interest rate environments, MPAM manages the fixed-income component of a portfolio by building bond ladders comprised of bonds which mature on a regular basis. If they believe that intermediate and long-term interest rates do not offer favorable investment return potential, they will either: (1) build shorter term bond ladders or (2) invest the fixed-income capital in short duration investments, including cash.

Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
