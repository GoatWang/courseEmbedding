EFI's Guy Gecht to Receive 2017 Soderstrom Award 


SDG Staff 


    July 20, 2017  


The Alexandria, Virginia-based International Digital Enterprise Alliance, better know as Idealliance, announces that Guy Gecht, chief executive officer of EFI, will be honored as the recipient of the 57th annual Walter E. Soderstrom Award at an upcoming event in September.
“Guy Gecht has a distinguished record of leadership in our industry and an unparalleled dedication to its progress and technological innovation,” says David Steinhardt, president and CEO of Idealliance. “He is a singularly worthy recipient of this significant honor and Idealliance is delighted to present him with its 2017 Walter E. Soderstrom Award.”
According to the announcement from Idealliance, Gecht has helped redefine the ways printing companies pursue new markets and refine their production operations, as he has guided EFI to becoming one of the industry’s most successful publicly traded companies.
Gecht joined EFI in 1995 and served in a variety of management and engineering roles, including company president, before becoming CEO in January 2000. From 1996 to 1999, he led engineering efforts for its largest product line and became vice president, general manager of EFI’s Fiery Servers Division. He led his team to dramatically expand EFI’s server product line, launching more than 35 products in 1998 alone.
Gecht was named a “Legend of Silicon Valley” in 2013 by the Frost & Sullivan Institute and a 2015 Game Changer by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. In 2015 he also received the Technical Association of the Graphic Arts (TAGA) Michael H. Bruno Award for his dedicated service and contributions to the advancement of the global graphic arts industry. Gecht holds a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and computer science from Ben Gurion University in Israel.
In addition to honoring the Soderstrom Award recipient, the annual Soderstrom Awards Dinner will induct 11 industry leaders into Idealliance’s prestigious Soderstrom Society. Those inductees will be announced soon, the organization says.
The Soderstrom Award and Society are named for Walter E. Soderstrom, a founder of Idealliance predecessor association NAPL.
Gecht’s award will be presented at the Soderstrom Awards Dinner at the University of Chicago Gleacher Center, Chicago, Illinois., 7 pm to 9:30 pm on Saturday, Sept. 9, the evening before the opening of the PRINT 2017 show.

Guy leads EFI’s Imaging of Things transformation – printing on any materials from analog process to digital – as the company researches, invents, and deploys next-generation digital technology that brings brands, ideas, and images to life for family-owned businesses and partners around the globe.
Under Guy’s leadership, EFI transformed from focusing on office printing with 100% of its business coming from OEMs to now, where EFI is focused on digital printing in areas of growth with about two thirds of the business sold directly or via resellers. EFI has seen a 12% growth rate on average in the past four years. In 2010, Guy set a goal for EFI that the company would reach $1 billion in revenue by 2016, up from $400 million the prior year. Each year since then, EFI has recorded record revenue as it tracks toward that goal, most recently with $790 million at the end of 2014.
Guy joined EFI in 1995. He was named as CEO in January 2000 and served as president of the company prior to that, where he spearheaded the launch of EFI’s first print workflow software. From 1996-1999, Guy led engineering efforts for the company's largest product line, Fiery Servers Division, culminating as Vice President, Fiery General Manager.
Prior to EFI, Guy was Director of Engineering at Interro Systems and held software management positions at ASP and Apple Israel. For five years, he served as an officer in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), managing an engineering development team and, later, was an Acting Manager of one of the IDF's high-tech divisions.
Guy holds a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and computer science from Ben Gurion University in Israel.
He was a member of the Israeli National Bridge Team and as a youth placed second in Europe and fifth globally in the World Junior Bridge Championships. Guy has served on the Board of Directors for CheckPoint Software Technologies since 2006.
Guy is a 2015 recipient of the Michael H. Bruno Award from the Technical Association of the Graphic Arts for outstanding contributions to the graphic arts industry. He was named a 2015 Game Changer by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. In 2014, Guy was inducted into the Soderstrom Society, the Epicomm honors organization that recognizes distinguished contributions of print industry leaders. Guy was named a “Legend of Silicon Valley” in 2013 by the Frost & Sullivan Institute.

Guy Gecht to Receive 2017 Soderstrom Award
Thursday, July 20, 2017
Press release from the issuing company
To be Honored at Annual Soderstrom Awards Dinner in Chicago on Sept. 9
Alexandria, Va. - Idealliance, the association for the Visual Communications and Media Industry, is pleased to announce that Guy Gecht, Chief Executive Officer of EFI, will be honored as the recipient of the 57th annual Walter E. Soderstrom Award. The award will be presented at the gala Soderstrom Awards Dinner at the University of Chicago Gleacher Center, Chicago, Ill., 7 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 9, the evening before the opening of the PRINT 2017 show.
"Guy Gecht has a distinguished record of leadership in our industry and an unparalleled dedication to its progress and technological innovation," said David Steinhardt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Idealliance. "He is a singularly worthy recipient of this significant honor and Idealliance is delighted to present him with its 2017 Walter E. Soderstrom Award."
Known for his insight and strong vision of the printing industry’s future, Gecht has helped redefine the ways printing companies pursue new markets and refine their production operations and has guided EFI to become one of the industry’s most successful publicly traded companies.
Gecht joined EFI in 1995 and served in a variety of management and engineering roles, including company President, before becoming Chief Executive Officer in January 2000. From 1996 to 1999, he led engineering efforts for its largest product line and became Vice President, General Manager of EFI's Fiery Servers Division. He led his team to dramatically expand EFI's server product line, launching more than 35 products in 1998 alone.
Gecht was named a "Legend of Silicon Valley" in 2013 by the Frost & Sullivan Institute and a 2015 Game Changer by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. In 2015 he also received the Technical Association of the Graphic Arts (TAGA) Michael H. Bruno Award for his dedicated service and contributions to the advancement of the global graphic arts industry. Gecht holds a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and computer science from Ben Gurion University in Israel.
In addition to honoring the Soderstrom Award recipient, the annual Soderstrom Awards Dinner will induct 11 industry leaders into Idealliance’s prestigious Soderstrom Society. The Class of 2017 Soderstrom Society inductees will be named shortly. The Soderstrom Award and Society are named for Walter E. Soderstrom, a founder of Idealliance predecessor association NAPL.
Industry companies, manufacturers, and suppliers are invited to participate in the Soderstrom Awards Dinner, an event many consider the industry’s most elegant evening. Reserving a table offers companies a perfect opportunity to bring together key executives and select customers or prospects for socializing and quality networking in a beautiful setting.
Tasteful signage on reserved tables also provides well-deserved recognition of a company’s support of the industry at one of its signature events.
Full and half-table sponsorships for the Soderstrom Awards Dinner are available for $5,000 and $2,500, respectively. Individual tickets are $195 before Aug. 15, $225 after that date. For information about table sponsorships or tickets, please contact Dean D’Ambrosi at (703) 837-1064 or ddambrosi@idealliance.org, or visit https://www.idealliance.org/events/soderstrom-gala/.
Visit Idealliance at Booth #2067 at the Print 2017 show, Sept. 10-13, at McCormick Place, Chicago, Ill. For information, visit www.print2017.com.

Business News Guy Gecht to Receive 2017 Soderstrom Award




Friday 21. July 2017 - Idealliance, the association for the Visual Communications and Media Industry, is pleased to announce that Guy Gecht, Chief Executive Officer of EFI, will be honored as the recipient of the 57th annual Walter E. Soderstrom Award. The award will be presented at the gala Soderstrom Awards Dinner at the University of Chicago Gleacher Center, Chicago, Ill., 7 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 9, the evening before the opening of the PRINT 2017 show.“Guy Gecht has a distinguished record of leadership in our industry and an unparalleled dedication to its progress and technological innovation,” said David Steinhardt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Idealliance. “He is a singularly worthy recipient of this significant honor and Idealliance is delighted to present him with its 2017 Walter E. Soderstrom Award.”Known for his insight and strong vision of the printing industry’s future, Gecht has helped redefine the ways printing companies pursue new markets and refine their production operations and has guided EFI to become one of the industry’s most successful publicly traded companies.Gecht joined EFI in 1995 and served in a variety of management and engineering roles, including company President, before becoming Chief Executive Officer in January 2000. From 1996 to 1999, he led engineering efforts for its largest product line and became Vice President, General Manager of EFI’s Fiery Servers Division. He led his team to dramatically expand EFI’s server product line, launching more than 35 products in 1998 alone.Gecht was named a “Legend of Silicon Valley” in 2013 by the Frost & Sullivan Institute and a 2015 Game Changer by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. In 2015 he also received the Technical Association of the Graphic Arts (TAGA) Michael H. Bruno Award for his dedicated service and contributions to the advancement of the global graphic arts industry. Gecht holds a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and computer science from Ben Gurion University in Israel.In addition to honoring the Soderstrom Award recipient, the annual Soderstrom Awards Dinner will induct 11 industry leaders into Idealliance’s prestigious Soderstrom Society. The Class of 2017 Soderstrom Society inductees will be named shortly. The Soderstrom Award and Society are named for Walter E. Soderstrom, a founder of Idealliance predecessor association NAPL.

FOLD of the WEEK by Trish Witkowski: Slick Glued Gate Pocket BrochureSometimes you need to design a brochure that can accommodate inserts, but you just don't want to use a pocket folder.

They designed a brochure using a classic Closed Gate fold, and glued down the fold-in panels to create a sturdy brochure with built-in slit pockets. The effect is clean, organized and super-sophisticated. Then, they took it "over the top" with gorgeous paper, embossing, and foil!
