	Offer to Exchange






	$1,150,000,000 7.5% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2019






	and the
	guarantees thereof that have been registered under






	the Securities Act of 1933 for any and all






	$1,150,000,000 7.5% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2019






	and the guarantees thereof







	This Exchange Offer will expire at 5:00
	P.M., New York City time, on                     , 20    , unless extended.





	 



	 




	We are offering, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this prospectus and the accompanying letter of transmittal
	(which together constitute the exchange offer), to exchange up to $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our registered 7.5% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2019 and the guarantees thereof (the exchange notes), for
	a like principal amount of our outstanding 7.5% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2019 and the guarantees thereof (the old notes). We refer to the old notes and the exchange notes collectively as the notes. The terms of the
	exchange notes and the guarantees thereof are identical to the terms of the old notes and the guarantees thereof in all material respects, except for the elimination of certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and additional interest
	provisions relating to the old notes.





	We will exchange any and all old notes that are validly tendered and not validly
	withdrawn prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on                     , 20    , unless extended.





	We have not applied, and do not intend to apply, for listing the notes on any national securities exchange or automated quotation system.




	Each broker-dealer that receives exchange notes for its own account pursuant to the exchange offer must acknowledge that it
	will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such exchange notes. The letter of transmittal states that by so acknowledging and delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an underwriter
	within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. This prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of exchange notes received in
	exchange for old notes where such old notes were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. We have agreed that, for a period of 120 days after the consummation of the exchange offer, we will
	make this prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See Plan of Distribution.



	 



	 





	See 

	Risk Factors

	 beginning on page 13 for a discussion of certain risks you should
	consider before participating in this exchange offer.






	Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state
	securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.




	 



	 





	The date of this prospectus is
	                    , 20    .

	In this prospectus, we use the term old notes to refer to the $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.5% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2019 that were issued on October 25,
	2012, and the term exchange notes to refer to the $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.5% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2019 that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities
	Act), and are being offered in exchange for the old notes as described in this prospectus. References to the notes in this prospectus include both the old notes and the exchange notes. As used in this prospectus, unless the context
	otherwise requires, (i) we, us, and our refer to Vantage Drilling Company and its subsidiaries (including the issuer) on a consolidated basis, (ii) the parent refers to Vantage Drilling
	Company, only and not to any of its subsidiaries, and (iii) the issuer refers to Offshore Group Investment Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability and the issuer of the notes.






	Our Company





	We are an international offshore drilling company focused on operating a fleet of modern, high specification drilling units. Our principal business is to contract drilling units, related equipment and
	work crews, primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and natural gas wells for our customers. We also provide construction supervision services for, and may in the future operate and manage, drilling units owned by others. Through our fleet of
	drilling units, we are a provider of offshore contract drilling services to major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies, focused primarily on international markets. Our fleet of owned and managed drilling units is currently
	comprised of four jackup rigs in operation and three drillships, one of which is in operation, one of which is currently undergoing customer acceptance testing and one of which is under construction. The

	Tungsten Explorer

	drillship is
	expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2013. We are also overseeing the construction of one additional drillship for a third party. Our ordinary shares are listed on the NYSE MKT under the symbol VTG.





	Recent Transactions





	In connection with the offering of the old notes, we conducted a tender offer and consent solicitation for our outstanding 11

	/



	2



	% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2015, or our existing notes, and we entered into a new $500.0 million senior secured term loan as described below.





	In a cash tender offer (the Tender Offer), we purchased $1,000,001,000 aggregate principal amount of the existing notes. As
	part of the Tender Offer, we also solicited consents (the Consent Solicitation) from holders of the existing notes to certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing the existing notes to permit us to refinance the existing notes
	with a portion of the proceeds of the notes and the term loan described below.




	We entered into the new $500.0 million senior
	secured term loan (the term loan) with a syndicate of lenders, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as collateral agent. The issuer, together with a U.S. co-borrower, will be the borrowers
	under the term loan and obligations under the term loan will be jointly and severally guaranteed by subsidiaries of parent and the issuer that guarantee the notes. For more information regarding the term loan, see Description of Other
	IndebtednessSenior Secured Term Loan.

	The Exchange Offer





	On October 25, 2012, we completed a private
	offering of $1,150,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the old notes and the guarantees thereof. As part of this private offering, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the old notes. You are entitled to
	exchange in the exchange offer your old notes for exchange notes which are identical in all material respects to the old notes except that:



	 





	 




	




	 





	The exchange notes have been registered under the Securities Act and will be freely tradable by persons who are not affiliated with us;






	 





	 




	




	 





	The exchange notes are not entitled to registration rights which are applicable to the old notes under the registration rights agreement; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	Our obligation to pay additional interest on the old notes due to the failure to consummate the exchange offer by a prior date does not apply to the
	exchange notes.







	The following is a summary of the exchange offer.



	 








	Exchange Offer





	We are offering to exchange up to $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our exchange notes and the guarantees thereof that have been registered under the Securities Act for an equal
	amount of our old notes.






	 






	Expiration Date; Withdrawal of Tenders





	The exchange offer will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on                     ,
	20    , unless we decide to extend it. We do not currently intend to extend the expiration date.





	 






	Conditions to the Exchange Offer





	The exchange offer is subject to customary conditions, which we may waive. Please read The Exchange OfferConditions to the Exchange Offer for more information regarding the
	conditions to the exchange offer.





	 






	Procedures for Tendering Old Notes





	You must do one of the following on or prior to the expiration of the exchange offer to participate in the exchange offer:





	 





	 




	




	 





	tender your old notes by sending the certificates for your old notes, in proper form for transfer, a properly completed and duly executed letter of
	transmittal, with any required signature guarantees, and all other documents required by the letter of transmittal, to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as registrar and exchange agent, at the address listed under the caption The
	Exchange OfferExchange Agent; or

	Table of Contents








	 




	




	 





	tender your old notes by using the book-entry transfer procedures described below and transmitting a properly completed and duly executed letter of
	transmittal, with any required signature guarantees, or an agents message instead of the letter of transmittal, to the exchange agent. In order for a book-entry transfer to constitute a valid tender of your old notes in the exchange offer,
	Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as registrar and exchange agent, must receive a confirmation of book-entry transfer of your old notes into the exchange agents account at The Depository Trust Company prior to the expiration of the
	exchange offer. For more information regarding the use of book-entry transfer procedures, including a description of the required agents message, please read the discussion under the caption The Exchange OfferProcedures for
	TenderingBook-Entry Transfer.






	 








	Special Procedures for Beneficial Owners





	If you are a beneficial owner whose old notes are registered in the name of a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee and you wish to tender your old notes in the
	exchange offer, you should promptly contact the person in whose name the old notes are registered and instruct that person to tender on your behalf.






	 





	 




	If you wish to tender in the exchange offer on your own behalf, prior to completing and executing the letter of transmittal and delivering the certificates for your old
	notes, you must either make appropriate arrangements to register ownership of the old notes in your name or obtain a properly completed bond power from the person in whose name the old notes are registered.





	 








	Withdrawal; Non-Acceptance





	You may withdraw any old notes tendered in the exchange offer at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
	                    , 20    . If we decide for any reason not to accept any old notes tendered for exchange, the old notes will
	be returned to the registered holder at our expense promptly after the expiration or termination of the exchange offer. In the case of old notes tendered by book-entry transfer into the exchange agents account at The Depository Trust Company,
	any withdrawn or unaccepted old notes will be credited to the tendering holders account at The Depository Trust Company. For further information regarding the withdrawal of tendered old notes, please read The Exchange
	OfferWithdrawal Rights.





	 






	U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations

	Federal Income Tax Considerations.





	 






	Use of Proceeds





	The issuance of the exchange notes will not provide us with any new proceeds. We are making this exchange offer solely to satisfy our obligations under the registration rights agreement.

	Fees and Expenses





	We will pay all of our expenses incident to the exchange offer.

	We have appointed Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as exchange agent for the exchange offer. You can find the address, telephone number and fax number of the exchange agent under the
	caption The Exchange OfferExchange Agent.





	 






	Resales of Exchange Notes





	Based on interpretations by the staff of the SEC, as set forth in no-action letters issued to third parties that are not related to us, we believe that the exchange notes you receive in the
	exchange offer may be offered for resale, resold or otherwise transferred by you without compliance with the registration and prospectus delivery provisions of the Securities Act so long as:






	 





	 




	




	 





	the exchange notes are being acquired in the ordinary course of business;






	 





	 




	




	 





	you are not participating, do not intend to participate, and have no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of
	the exchange notes issued to you in the exchange offer;






	 





	 




	




	 





	you are not our affiliate; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	you are not a broker-dealer tendering old notes acquired directly from us for your account.






	 





	 




	The SEC has not considered this exchange offer in the context of a no-action letter, and we cannot assure you that the SEC would make similar determinations with
	respect to this exchange offer. If any of these conditions are not satisfied, or if our belief is not accurate, and you transfer any exchange notes issued to you in the exchange offer without delivering a resale prospectus meeting the requirements
	of the Securities Act or without an exemption from registration of your exchange notes from those requirements, you may incur liability under the Securities Act. We will not assume, nor will we indemnify you against, any such liability. Each
	broker-dealer that receives exchange notes for its own account in exchange for old notes, where the old notes were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading activities, must acknowledge that it will deliver a
	prospectus in connection with any resale of such exchange notes. Please read Plan of Distribution.





	 





	 




	Please read The Exchange OfferResales of Exchange Notes for more information regarding resales of the exchange notes.





	 






	Effect on Holders of Old Notes






	As a result of the making of, and upon acceptance for exchange of all validly tendered old notes pursuant to the terms of, the exchange offer, we will have fulfilled a covenant contained in
	the registration rights agreement and, accordingly, we will not be obligated to pay additional interest as described in the registration rights agreement. If you are a holder of old notes and do not tender your old notes in the







	 






	 




	6








	Table of Contents








	 





	exchange offer, you will continue to hold such old notes and you will be entitled to all the rights and limitations applicable to the old notes in the indenture, except for any rights under the
	registration rights agreement that by their terms terminate upon the consummation of the exchange offer.






	 






	Consequences of Failure to Exchange





	All untendered old notes will continue to be subject to the restrictions on transfer provided for in the old notes and in the indenture. In general, the old notes may not be offered or sold
	unless registered under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Other than in connection with the exchange offer, we do not currently
	anticipate that we will register the old notes under the Securities Act.

	Table of Contents







	Terms of the Exchange Notes





	The exchange notes will be identical to the old notes except that the exchange notes are registered under the Securities Act and will not
	have restrictions on transfer, registration rights or provisions for additional interest and will contain different administrative terms. The exchange notes will evidence the same debt as the old notes, and the same indenture will govern the
	exchange notes and the old notes. Because the exchange notes will be registered, the exchange notes will not be subject to transfer restrictions, and holders of old notes that have tendered and had their old notes accepted in the exchange offer will
	have no registration rights.




	The following summary contains basic information about the exchange notes and is not intended to
	be complete. It does not contain all the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of the exchange notes, please refer to the section of this prospectus entitled Description of the Exchange Notes.

	the notes.






	 





	 




	At September 30, 2012, after giving effect to the offering of the notes and the application of the proceeds of the offering and the term loan, parent and its
	subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, would have had outstanding approximately $2.8 billion of senior indebtedness, $2.7 billion of which would have been senior secured first-priority indebtedness, and would have had $25.0 million of available
	borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement.





	 








	Intercreditor Agreement






	In connection with the Transactions, the issuer, the guarantors, the trustee, the pari passu collateral agent, the term loan agent, the term loan collateral agent on behalf of the term loan
	secured parties, the credit agreement agent, the credit agreement collateral agent on behalf of the credit agreement secured parties, and the noteholder collateral agent on behalf of the existing notes secured parties entered into an amended and
	restated intercreditor agreement (the amended intercreditor agreement). The amended intercreditor agreement amended and restated the existing intercreditor agreement, which relates to the relative rights of the revolving credit agreement
	lenders and the existing notes secured parties. The amended intercreditor agreement defines the rights of such parties with respect to the

	Table of Contents








	 





	collateral, and provides, among other things, that all indebtedness under the indenture governing the exchange notes, certain other indebtedness permitted under the indenture and all other
	obligations related to such indebtedness and owing under the documents relating to such indebtedness will be secured by liens which are intended to rank pari passu with the first priority liens that secure the other pari passu obligations under our
	revolving credit agreement, the term loan, the indenture governing the existing notes and certain other indebtedness that we may incur in the future and to provide for priority of payment to the revolving credit agreement secured parties from the
	proceeds of collateral (other than with respect to an event of loss a vessel).






	 








	Optional Redemption





	On or after November 1, 2015, the issuer may redeem some or all of the exchange notes at redemption prices that decrease over time, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption
	date as described under the heading Description of NotesRedemption & Offer to PurchaseOptional Redemption.






	 





	 




	Prior to November 1, 2015, the issuer may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the exchange notes (including additional notes, if any) of each series
	with the net proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 107.5% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, provided that, following such redemption, at least 65% of the
	aggregate principal amount of the notes issued under the indenture (including additional notes, if any) remains outstanding, and the redemption occurs within 60 days of the date of the closing of such equity offering.





	 





	 




	In addition, the issuer may, at its option, redeem some or all of the exchange notes at any time prior to November 1, 2015, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
	principal amount thereof plus a make-whole premium.





	 






	Redemption upon a Change in Tax Law





	Under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, the issuer will have the option to redeem the exchange notes, in whole but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100%
	of the aggregate principal amount of the exchange notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption, if the issuer or any guarantor have become or would become obligated to pay certain amounts as a result of the
	imposition of withholding taxes on the notes as a result of a change in the laws of any jurisdiction in which the issuer or any guarantor is organized or otherwise considered by a taxing authority to be a resident for tax purposes or from or through
	which the issuer or any guarantor make a payment on the notes or any guarantee. See Description of NotesRedemption & Offer to PurchaseOptional Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes.





	 








	Mandatory Redemption Upon Event of Loss of a Vessel






	Upon certain events of loss with respect to a vessel, we will be required to redeem, on a pro rata basis, notes and certain other








	 






	 




	10








	Table of Contents








	 





	pari passu obligations with proceeds received in respect of such loss at a redemption price for the notes equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
	the date of redemption. See Description of NotesRedemption & Offer to PurchaseMandatory Redemption Upon Event of Loss of a Vessel.






	 








	Change of Control Offer





	If parent or the issuer experiences a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the exchange notes), each holder of exchange notes will have the right to require the issuer to
	repurchase all or any part of its exchange notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. See Description of NotesRedemption & Offer to
	PurchaseChange of Control.





	 






	Asset Sale Offer





	If the issuer or any restricted subsidiary engages in certain asset sales (other than a permitted sale of a vessel that is not a drillship), within 360 days of such sale, the issuer generally
	must use the net cash proceeds from such sales to repay debt, to acquire another company in its industry, to make capital expenditures or to invest in its business, or the issuer must make an offer to purchase a principal amount of the exchange
	notes equal to the excess net cash proceeds. The purchase price of each exchange note so purchased will be 100% of its principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. In the case of a permitted sale of a vessel that is not
	a drillship, within 180 days of such sale, the issuer generally must reinvest the net cash proceeds from such sale in another vessel. None of the issuer or any restricted subsidiary is permitted to engage in asset sales of drillships. See
	Description of NotesRedemption & Offer to PurchaseAsset Sales.






	 








	Certain Covenants





	The indenture governing the exchange notes, among other things, limits the issuers and any restricted subsidiaries ability and, in certain cases, the ability of parent to:

	These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. See Description of the Exchange NotesCertain Covenants.





	 








	No Public Market





	The exchange notes are a new issue of securities and there is currently no established market for them. The initial purchasers advised us that they intend to make a market for the exchange notes
	as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to do so and may discontinue any such market making activities without any notice. We cannot assure you that a liquid market for the exchange notes
	will develop or be maintained





	 






	Form and Denomination





	The notes may be issued only in registered form. The notes will initially be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The notes initially
	sold by the initial purchasers will be represented by permanent global notes in fully registered form, deposited with a custodian for and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. Beneficial interests in the global notes will be shown on, and
	transfers will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC and its participants. Except as described herein, notes in certificated form will not be issued in exchange for the global notes or interests therein.





	 






	Risk Factors





	You should consider carefully all of the information set forth in this prospectus and, in particular, you should evaluate the risks described under Risk Factors before deciding to
	invest in the exchange notes.

	For the purposes of determining the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings are defined as pre-tax
	income from continuing operations plus fixed charges and amortization of capitalized interest less capitalized interest. Fixed charges are the sum of (a) interest expensed and capitalized, (b) amortized premiums, discounts and capitalized
	expenses related to indebtedness and (c) an estimate of the interest within rental expense. Earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by $51.9 million, $12.5 million, $74.5 million and $73.2 million for the years ended December 31,
	2008, December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011, respectively, and $51.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. We had no preferred shares outstanding as of the end of any of the periods
	shown.

	RISK FACTORS






	An investment in the exchange notes involves a number of risks. You should consider carefully the following information about these
	risks, together with the other information included in this prospectus, before tendering your old notes and participating in the exchange offer. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may
	also impair our business operations or the value of the exchange notes. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. If they do, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
	materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our securities, including the exchange notes, could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.






	Risk Related to the Exchange Offer






	If you do not properly tender your old notes, you
	will continue to hold unregistered old notes and your ability to transfer those notes will be adversely affected.





	We will
	only issue exchange notes in exchange for old notes that you timely and properly tender. Therefore, you should allow sufficient time to ensure timely delivery of the old notes and you should carefully follow the instructions on how to tender your
	old notes. Neither we nor the exchange agent is required to inform you of any defects or irregularities with respect to your tender of old notes. Please read The Exchange OfferProcedures for Tendering and Description of the
	Exchange Notes.




	If you do not exchange your old notes for exchange notes in the exchange offer, you will continue to be
	subject to the restrictions on transfer of your old notes described in the legend on the certificates for your old notes. In general, you may only offer or sell the old notes if they are registered under the Securities Act and applicable state
	securities laws, or offered and sold under an exemption from these requirements. We do not plan to register any sale of the old notes under the Securities Act. For further information regarding the consequences of tendering your old notes in the
	exchange offer, please read The Exchange OfferConsequences of Failure to Exchange Outstanding Securities.





	You may find
	it difficult to sell your exchange notes.





	Although the exchange notes will be registered under the Securities Act, the
	exchange notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Because there is no public market for the exchange notes, you may not be able to resell them.




	We cannot assure you that an active market will exist for the exchange notes or that any trading market that does develop will be liquid. If an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the
	market price and liquidity of the exchange notes may be adversely affected. If a market for the exchange notes develops, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price. The trading market for the exchange notes may be adversely
	affected by:



	 





	 




	




	 





	changes in the overall market for non-investment grade securities;






	 





	 




	




	 





	changes in our financial performance or prospects;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the financial performance or prospects for companies in our industry generally;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the number of holders of the exchange notes;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the exchange notes; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions.

	Table of Contents




	Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to substantial
	volatility in prices. The market for the exchange notes, if any, may be subject to similar volatility. Prospective investors in the exchange notes should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of such investment for an
	indefinite period of time.





	Some holders who exchange their old notes may be deemed to be underwriters.





	If you exchange your old notes in the exchange offer for the purpose of participating in a distribution of the exchange notes, you may be
	deemed to have received restricted securities and, if so, will be required to comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale transaction.





	Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry






	Our business is difficult to evaluate due to our limited operating history and our prospects will be dependent on our ability to meet a number of challenges.





	Because we have a limited operating history, you may not be able to evaluate our future prospects accurately. Our prospects will be
	primarily dependent on our ability to maintain customer drilling contracts for our drilling units and other factors listed below. If we are not able to successfully meet these challenges, our prospects, business, financial condition and results of
	operations would be materially and adversely affected.





	A small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues, and
	the loss of one or more of these customers or our inability to ultimately realize future contracted revenue could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.





	We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a few customers. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, two customers
	accounted for approximately 41% and 13%, respectively, of our revenue. Upon the commencement of the Petrobras contract for the

	Titanium Explorer

	, we expect that Petrobras will become a major customer and, together with ONGC, will account for
	an estimated contract backlog of approximately $2.5 billion as of September 30, 2012. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if any one of these customers interrupt or curtail their
	activities, fail to pay for the services that have been performed, terminate their contracts, fail to renew their existing contracts or refuse to award new contracts and we are unable to enter into contracts with new customers on comparable terms.
	The loss of any of our significant customers or our inability to ultimately realize future contracted revenue could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.





	We are exposed to the credit risks of our key customers, including certain affiliated companies, and certain other third parties, and nonpayment or
	nonperformance by these customers and other parties could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.





	We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, including certain companies owned by or associated with our affiliates. Under the construction supervision
	contract for the

	Cobalt Explorer

	, a drillship for which construction was suspended in June 2009, F3 Capital owes us approximately $3.0 million for services rendered in 2009 before the suspension of this contract. Any material nonpayment or
	nonperformance by these entities for any services we may provide in the future, other key customers and certain other third parties could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If any key customers or other
	parties default on their obligations to us, our financial results and condition could be adversely affected. Furthermore, some of these customers and other parties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks.

	A material or extended decline in expenditures by oil and natural gas exploration and production
	companies due to a decline or volatility in oil and natural gas prices, a decrease in demand for oil and natural gas, or other factors, would adversely affect our business.





	Our business, including the utilization rates and dayrates we achieve for our owned and managed drilling units, depends on the level of activity in oil and natural gas exploration, development and
	production expenditures of our customers. Oil and natural gas prices and customers expectations of potential changes in these prices significantly affect this level of activity. Commodity prices are affected by numerous factors, including the
	following:



	 





	 




	




	 





	changes in global economic conditions;

	the worldwide military and political environment, uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities
	or other crises in significant oil and natural gas producing regions or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere.







	In addition to oil and gas prices, the offshore drilling industry is influenced by additional factors, including:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the availability of competing offshore drilling vessels and the level of construction activity for new drilling vessels;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the level of costs for associated offshore oilfield and construction services;

	Table of Contents




	Any of these factors could reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our business
	and results of operations.





	Our jackup drilling contracts are generally short-term, and we could experience reduced profitability if
	customers reduce activity levels, terminate or seek to renegotiate drilling contracts with us, or if market conditions dictate that we enter into contracts that provide for payment based on a footage or turnkey basis, rather than on a dayrate basis.





	Many jackup drilling contracts are short-term, and oil and natural gas companies tend to reduce activity levels quickly in
	response to downward changes in oil and natural gas prices. Due to the short-term nature of most of our jackup drilling contracts, a decline in market conditions can quickly affect our business if customers reduce their levels of operations. During
	depressed market conditions, a customer may no longer need a unit that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable unit at a lower dayrate. As a result, customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their existing drilling
	contracts or avoid their obligations under those contracts. In addition, our customers may have the right to terminate, or may seek to renegotiate, existing contracts if we experience downtime, operational problems above the contractual limit or
	safety-related issues, if the drilling unit is a total loss, if the drilling unit is not delivered to the customer within the period specified in the contract or in other specified circumstances, which include events beyond the control of either
	party.




	Some of our current jackup drilling contracts, and some drilling contracts that we may enter into in the future, may
	include terms allowing customers to terminate contracts without cause, with little or no prior notice and without penalty or early termination payments. In addition, we could be required to pay penalties, which could be material, if some of these
	contracts are terminated due to downtime, operational problems or failure to deliver. Some of the contracts with customers that we enter into in the future may be cancellable at the option of the customer upon payment of a penalty, which may not
	fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Early termination of a contract may result in a drilling unit being idle for an extended period of time. The likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of
	market weakness. Under most of our contracts, it is an event of default if we file a petition for bankruptcy or reorganization, which would allow the customer to terminate such contract.




	Currently, our drilling contracts are dayrate contracts, where we charge a fixed rate per day regardless of the number of days needed to
	drill the well. While we plan to continue to perform services on a dayrate basis, market conditions may dictate that we enter into contracts that provide for payment based on a footage basis, where we are paid a fixed amount for each foot drilled
	regardless of the time required or the problems encountered in drilling the well, or enter into turnkey contracts, where we agree to drill a well to a specific depth for a fixed price and bear some of the well equipment costs. These types of
	contracts are riskier for us than a dayrate contract as we would be subject to downhole geologic conditions in the well that cannot always be accurately determined and subject us to greater risks associated with equipment and downhole tool failures.
	Unfavorable downhole geologic conditions and equipment and downhole tool failures may result in significant cost increases or may result in a decision to abandon a well project which would result in us not being able to invoice revenues for
	providing services. Any such termination or renegotiation of contracts and unfavorable costs increases or loss of revenue could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.





	Lower prices for oil and natural gas reduce demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.





	A slowdown in economic activity caused by the recession initially reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in
	lower oil and natural gas prices. Benchmark crude prices peaked at over $140 per barrel in July 2008 and then declined dramatically to approximately $45 per barrel at year-end 2008. During 2009 and 2010, the benchmark for crude prices fluctuated
	between the mid $30s per barrel and low $90s per barrel. Since mid-2011, the benchmark for crude prices fluctuated between the mid $70s per barrel and low $100s per barrel. Demand for our services depends on oil and natural
	gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly




	 




	16








	Table of Contents




	affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices. In addition, demand for our services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the
	corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices could depress the near-term levels of exploration, development, and production activity. Perceptions of longer-term lower oil and
	natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects. Lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for
	our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Additionally, these factors may adversely impact our financial position if they are determined to cause an impairment of our long-lived assets.





	Failure to obtain delivery of the Tungsten Explorer and to secure a new drilling contract for this vessel could have a material and adverse effect on
	our business.





	We expect to take delivery of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	in the second quarter of 2013, but such vessel
	may not be delivered to us on time, or at all. A delay in the delivery date of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	beyond what we expect or non-delivery of such vessel could result from a variety of factors affecting the shipyard, or our failure to make
	the final construction payment under the Tungsten Explorer Construction Contract. Failure to obtain delivery of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	in a timely manner or at all may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
	results of operations. In addition, if any non-delivery of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	results from non-performance by the shipyard, holders of the notes and any other pari passu obligations may not have the benefit of a refund guarantee if we are
	not able to obtain an assignment of any such refund guarantee and the Tungsten Explorer Construction Contract for the benefit of the holders of the notes and other pari passu obligations, which we have agreed to use our commercially reasonable
	efforts to obtain as soon as practicable. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to obtain an assignment of any such refund guarantee or the Tungsten Explorer Construction Contract.




	In addition, we have not yet secured a drilling contract for the

	Tungsten Explorer

	, and there can be no guarantee that we will
	enter into a drilling contract for the vessel prior to its delivery. Our ability to obtain a contract will depend on prevailing market conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control. Further, upon obtaining a drilling contract for the

	Tungsten Explorer

	, such drilling contract may be cancelled or we may be required to pay damages to our customer if the vessel is not acceptable to the customer or if we are unable to deliver the

	Tungsten Explorer

	or an acceptable
	replacement drillship to our customer by the relevant contract commencement date deadline. The cancellation of the contract or payment of damages to such customer may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations
	and future prospects.





	Construction projects are subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns, which could have an adverse impact
	on our liquidity and results of operations.





	The

	Tungsten Explorer

	is currently under construction and we are
	managing this project with the shipyard. We are also overseeing the construction of the

	Dalian Developer

	for a third party. As part of our growth strategy we may also contract from time to time for the construction of drilling units or may
	enter into agreements to manage the construction of drilling units for others. Construction projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, including costs or delays resulting from the
	following:



	 





	 




	




	 





	unexpected long delivery times for, or shortages of, key equipment, parts and materials;






	 





	 




	




	 





	shortages of skilled labor and other shipyard personnel necessary to perform the work;






	 





	 




	




	 





	unforeseen increases in the cost of equipment, labor and raw materials, particularly steel;






	 





	 




	




	 





	unforeseen design and engineering problems;

	inability to obtain required permits or approvals.







	If we experience delays and costs overruns in the construction of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	or any other drilling units for which we may provide construction management services from time to time due
	to certain of the factors listed above, it could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Delays in the delivery of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	may result in our inability to timely secure a drilling
	contract or result in the delay in contract commencement, leading to financial penalties and a loss of expected revenue to us, and may also cause the customer to terminate or shorten the term of the drilling contract for the unit pursuant to
	applicable late delivery clauses. In the event this unit is not completed on a timely basis, we may not be able to secure a replacement unit that is acceptable to the customer.





	We may not be able to raise equity or debt financing sufficient to pay amounts due under future construction contracts or on acceptable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability
	to execute our growth strategy.





	Our business is capital intensive and, to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash
	from operations, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity offerings to execute our growth strategy and to fund our capital expenditures. If we are unable to borrow additional funds, to the extent required or on
	acceptable terms, raise other capital or utilize available cash on hand, we may not be able to build or acquire future drilling units. If for any reason we fail to make a payment when due, which may result in a default under a construction
	contract, or otherwise fail to take delivery of a new drilling unit, we would be prevented from realizing potential revenues from these projects, we could also lose all or a portion of payments already made and we could be liable for penalties and
	damages under such contracts.





	Our business is affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions and the condition of the oil
	and natural gas industry.





	There has historically been a strong correlation between the development of the world economy
	and demand for energy, including oil and gas. Although there are signs that the recent economic recession has abated in many countries, there is still considerable instability in the world economy, due in part to uncertainty in the United States
	regarding the federal debt ceiling, and in the economies of Eurozone countries, such as Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy, where a new economic downturn has introduced further volatility in the global markets. In addition, continued
	hostilities and insurrections in the Middle East and North Africa and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks against the United States or other countries could adversely affect the economies of the United States and of other countries. These
	events and other local, national and worldwide economic conditions could lead to a reduction in economic activity for the world economy, which in turn could reduce the overall demand for oil and gas and for our services. Such changes could adversely
	affect our results of operations and cash flows beyond what might be offset by the simultaneous impact of possibly higher oil and gas prices. In addition, future economic conditions or the expectation for future economic conditions may cause many
	oil and natural gas production companies to reduce or delay expenditures in order to reduce costs, which in turn may cause a further reduction in the demand for drilling services.

	Our industry is highly competitive, cyclical and subject to intense price competition. Due to our limited
	operating history, we may be at a competitive disadvantage.





	The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive,
	and contracts have traditionally been awarded on a competitive bid basis. The technical capabilities, availability and pricing of a drilling unit are often the primary factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Other key
	factors include a contractors reputation for service, safety record, environmental record, technical and engineering support and long-term relationships with major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies. Our competitors in the
	offshore contract drilling industry generally have larger, more diverse fleets, longer operating histories with established safety and environmental records over a measurable period of time and long-term relationships with customers. This provides
	our competitors with competitive advantages that may adversely affect our efforts to contract our drilling units on favorable terms, if at all, and correspondingly negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. Additionally, we
	are at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that are better capitalized because they are in a better position to withstand the effects of a downturn in our industry.




	The offshore contract drilling industry, historically, has been very cyclical with periods of high demand, limited supply and high
	dayrates alternating with periods of low demand, excess supply and low dayrates. Many offshore drilling units are highly mobile. Competitors may move drilling units from region to region in response to changes in demand. It is currently estimated
	that 22 newly constructed jackup rigs have or will be entered into service between March 2012 and December 2012 and 24 ultra-deepwater rigs are scheduled for delivery through 2013. This could result in an excess supply of rigs in the markets in
	which we operate. Periods of low demand and excess supply intensify competition in the industry and often result in some drilling units becoming idle for long periods of time. Our limited operating history may put us at a competitive disadvantage
	and, as a result, our drilling units may become idle. Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates, or extended idle time, could result in the recognition of impairment charges on our drilling units if cash flow estimates, based upon
	information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of the drilling units may not be recoverable.





	There may
	be limits to our ability to mobilize drilling units between geographic markets and the time and costs of such drilling unit mobilizations may be material to our business.





	The offshore contract drilling market is generally a global market as drilling units may be mobilized from one market to another market. However, geographic markets can, from time to time, have material
	fluctuations in costs and risks as the ability to mobilize drilling units can be impacted by several factors including, but not limited to, governmental regulation and customs practices, the significant costs to move a drilling unit, availability of
	tow boats, weather, political instability, civil unrest, military actions, and the technical capability of the drilling units to operate in various environments. Any increase in the supply of drilling units in the geographic areas in which we
	operate, whether through new construction, refurbishment or conversion of drilling units from other uses, remobilization or changes in the law or its application, could increase competition and result in lower dayrates and/or utilization, which
	would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, while a drilling unit is being mobilized from one geographic market to another, we may not be paid by the customer for the time that the drilling unit
	is out of service. Also, we may mobilize the drilling unit to another geographic market without a customer contract which will result in costs not reimbursable by future customers.





	Our business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and contractual indemnity rights may not be adequate to cover our losses.





	Our operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling and operation of oil and natural gas wells, such as blowouts,
	reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, punchthroughs, craterings, fires and pollution. The occurrence of these events (such as events similar to the 2010 incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico involving the Macondo well) could
	result in the suspension of drilling or production operations, claims by the operator and others affected by such events, severe damage to, or destruction of, the property and




	 




	19








	Table of Contents




	equipment involved, injury or death to drilling unit personnel, environmental damage and increased insurance costs. We may also be subject to personal injury and other claims of drilling unit
	personnel as a result of our drilling operations. Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal operating conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services and personnel shortages.




	In addition, our operations will be subject to perils peculiar to marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss
	or damage from severe weather. Severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our drilling units could be damaged by high winds, turbulent seas, or unstable sea bottom conditions, which could potentially cause us to curtail
	operations for significant periods of time until such damages are repaired.




	Damage to the environment and natural resources
	could result from our operations, particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires. We may also be subject to property, environmental, natural resource and other damage claims by host governments, oil and natural gas companies and
	other businesses operating offshore and in coastal areas, as well as claims by individuals living in or around coastal areas.




	As is customary in our industry, the risks of our operations are partially covered by our insurance and partially by contractual
	indemnities from our customers. However, insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses, and we may not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. Moreover, pollution and environmental risks
	generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event resulting in damage to our drilling units, including severe weather, terrorist acts, war, civil disturbances, pollution or environmental damage, occurs and is not fully
	covered by insurance or a recoverable indemnity from a customer, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.





	Our offshore drilling operations could be adversely impacted by the Macondo well incident and the resulting changes in regulation of offshore oil and
	gas exploration and development activity.





	Offshore drilling operations in the United States and elsewhere could be
	adversely impacted by the Macondo well incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the resulting changes in regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities. After the Macondo well incident, the U.S. Department of the Interior
	implemented a six-month moratorium/suspension on certain drilling activities in water depths greater than 500 feet in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. While the moratorium has since been lifted, significant new requirements with respect to development and
	production activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have been imposed and the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow-water areas have been delayed until it is confirmed that those requirements have been met. These new
	requirements relate to the design of wells and testing of the integrity of wellbores, the use of drilling fluids, the functionality and testing of well control equipment, including blowout preventers, and other environmental and safety matters.





	Customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us.





	Consistent with standard industry practice, our customers generally assume liability for and indemnify us against well control and subsurface risks under our dayrate contracts, and we do not separately
	purchase insurance for such indemnified risks. These risks are those associated with the loss of control of a well, such as blowout or cratering (for example, the recent incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico involving the Macondo well), the cost to
	regain control or redrill the well and associated pollution. In the future, we may not be able to obtain agreements from customers to indemnify us for such damages and risks or the indemnities that we do obtain may be limited in scope and duration,
	including with respect to indemnification for punitive damages, which may not be enforceable. Additionally, even if our customers agree to indemnify us, there can be no assurance that they will necessarily be financially able to indemnify us against
	all of these risks.

	Our insurance coverage may not be adequate if a catastrophic event occurs.





	As a result of the number and significance of catastrophic events in the offshore drilling industry in recent years, such as hurricanes
	and spills in the Gulf of Mexico, insurance underwriters have increased insurance premiums and increased restrictions on coverage and have made other coverages, such as Gulf of Mexico windstorm coverage, unavailable to us on commercially reasonable
	terms.




	While we believe we have reasonable policy limits of property, casualty, liability, and business interruption
	insurance, including coverage for acts of terrorism, with financially sound insurers, we cannot guarantee that our policy limits for property, casualty, liability, and business interruption insurance, including coverage for severe weather, terrorist
	acts, war, civil disturbances, pollution or environmental damage, would be adequate should a catastrophic event occur related to our property, plant or equipment, or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully
	pay related claims or damages. When any of our coverage expires, or when we seek coverage in the future, we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage will be available, offered at reasonable prices, or offered by insurers with sufficient financial
	soundness. Additionally, we do not have third party windstorm insurance for our drillship operating in the Gulf of Mexico and we may not have windstorm insurance for any vessel that we operate in the Gulf of Mexico in the future. The occurrence of
	an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our drilling units could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage and/or our liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or
	if an insurer was unable to sufficiently or fully pay related claims or damages.





	Our international operations are subject to additional
	political, economic and other uncertainties not generally associated with domestic operations.





	A primary component of our
	business strategy is to operate in international oil and natural gas producing areas. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in any business operating in foreign countries, including:



	 





	 




	




	 





	political, social and economic instability, war and acts of terrorism;






	 





	 




	




	 





	government corruption;






	 





	 




	




	 





	potential seizure, expropriation or nationalization of assets;






	 





	 




	




	 





	damage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees, including kidnappings;

	currency fluctuations and devaluations; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	other forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control.







	Our financial condition and results of operations could be susceptible to adverse events beyond our control that may occur in the
	particular country or region in which we are active. Additionally, we may experience currency exchange losses where, at some future date, revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where we do not hedge exposure to a
	foreign currency. We may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available in the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of
	income or capital.




	Many governments favor or effectively require that drilling contracts be awarded to local contractors or
	require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These practices may result in inefficiencies or put us at a disadvantage when bidding for contracts against local competitors.




	Our offshore contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws
	and regulations relating to the equipment and operation of drilling units, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and natural gas exploration and development, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel, the use of local
	employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of drilling units and other equipment. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of
	concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their countries. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the
	amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do so. Operations in less developed countries can be subject to legal systems which are not as mature or predictable as those in more
	developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings.





	Our business is subject to numerous
	governmental laws and regulations, including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages.





	Many aspects of our operations are affected by governmental laws and regulations that may relate directly or indirectly to the contract drilling industry, including those requiring us to control the
	discharge of oil and other contaminants into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of natural resources. Countries where we currently operate have environmental laws and regulations covering the discharge of oil and other
	contaminants and protection of the environment in connection with operations. Additionally, any operations and activities in the United States and its territorial waters will be subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including the
	Clean Water Act, the OPA, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and MARPOL. Failure to comply with these laws
	and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and the issuance of injunctions that may limit or
	prohibit our operations.




	Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years and may
	in certain circumstances impose strict liability, rendering us liable for environmental and natural resource damages without regard to negligence or fault on our part. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or
	conditions caused by, others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed. The application of these requirements, the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or
	regulations curtailing exploratory or development drilling for oil and natural gas could materially limit future contract drilling opportunities or materially increase our costs. In addition, we may be required to make significant capital
	expenditures to comply with laws and regulations.




	 




	22








	Table of Contents




	In addition, some financial institutions are imposing, as a condition to financing,
	requirements to comply with additional non-governmental environmental and social standards in connection with operations outside the United States, such as the Equator Principles, a credit risk management framework for determining, assessing and
	managing environmental and social risk in project finance transactions. Such additional standards could impose significant new costs on us, which may materially and adversely affect us.





	Changes in U.S. federal laws and regulations, or in those of other jurisdictions where we operate, including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural
	resource damages, may adversely affect our operations.





	If the U.S. government amends or enacts new federal laws or
	regulations, our potential exposure to liability for operations and activities in the United States and its territorial waters may increase. Although the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 provides federal caps on liability for pollution or contamination,
	future laws and regulations may increase our liability for pollution or contamination resulting from any operations and activities we may have in the United States and its territorial waters including punitive damages and administrative, civil and
	criminal penalties. In addition, other jurisdictions where we operate may also modify their laws and regulations in a manner that would increase our liability for pollution and other environmental damage.





	New technology and/or products may cause us to become less competitive.





	The offshore contract drilling industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. As competitors and
	others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial,
	technical and personnel resources that may allow them to access technological advantages and implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement new technology or products on a timely basis or at an
	acceptable cost. Thus, our inability to effectively use and implement new and emerging technology may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.





	Our financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions, fail to successfully integrate acquired assets or businesses we acquire, or are unable
	to obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms.





	The acquisition of assets or businesses that we believe to be
	complementary to our drilling operations is an important component of our business strategy. We believe that acquisition opportunities may arise from time to time, and that any such acquisition could be significant. At any given time, discussions
	with one or more potential sellers may be at different stages. However, any such discussions may not result in the consummation of an acquisition transaction, and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisitions. We cannot predict the
	effect, if any, that any announcement or consummation of an acquisition would have on the trading price of our securities. Our business is capital intensive and any such transactions could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash.
	We may need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings to execute our growth strategy and to fund acquisitions. Adequate sources of capital may not be available when needed on favorable terms. If we raise
	additional capital by issuing additional equity securities, existing shareholders may be diluted. If our capital resources are insufficient at any time in the future, we may be unable to fund acquisitions, take advantage of business opportunities or
	respond to competitive pressures, any of which could harm our business.




	Any future acquisitions could present a number of risks, including:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the risk of using management time and resources to pursue acquisitions that are not successfully completed;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations;







	 




	23








	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	the risk of failing to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and timely; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the risk of diversion of managements attention from existing operations or other priorities.







	If we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other operations or assets, our financial condition could be adversely affected and
	we may be unable to implement an important component of our business strategy successfully. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in integrating our acquisitions in a timely and cost-effective manner, our financial condition and results of operations
	could be adversely affected.





	Operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating
	revenues.





	We do not expect operating and maintenance costs to necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating
	revenues. Operating revenues may fluctuate as a function of changes in dayrates. However, costs for operating a drilling unit are generally fixed or only semi-variable regardless of the dayrate being earned. In addition, should the drilling units
	incur idle time between contracts, we would typically maintain the crew to prepare the drilling unit for its next contract and would not reduce costs to correspond to the decrease in revenue. During times of moderate activity, reductions in costs
	may not be immediate as the crew may be required to prepare the drilling units for stacking, after which time the crew will be reduced to a level necessary to maintain the drilling unit in working condition with the extra crew members assigned to
	active drilling units or dismissed. In addition, as drilling units are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly. Equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending
	upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment. Contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period
	over which such expenditures are amortized.





	The loss of some of our key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our
	business prospects.





	Our future operational performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key
	members of our management as well as marketing, sales and operations personnel. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our
	ability to attract, retain and further motivate highly skilled management, marketing, sales and operations personnel. We may experience intense competition for personnel, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain key employees or that
	we will be successful in attracting, assimilating and retaining personnel in the future.





	Failure to employ a sufficient number of skilled
	workers or an increase in labor costs could hurt our operations.





	We require skilled personnel to operate and provide
	technical services to, and support for, our drilling units. In periods of increasing activity and when the number of operating units in our areas of operation increases, either because of new construction, re-activation of idle units or the
	mobilization of units into the region, shortages of qualified personnel could arise, creating upward pressure on wages and difficulty in staffing. The shortages of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel also
	could negatively affect the quality and timeliness of our work. In addition, our ability to expand operations depends in part upon our ability to increase the size of the skilled labor force.

	Consolidation of suppliers may increase the cost of obtaining supplies, which may have a material adverse
	effect on our results of operations and financial condition.





	We rely on certain third parties to provide supplies and
	services necessary for our offshore drilling operations, including, but not limited to, drilling equipment suppliers, catering and machinery suppliers. Recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives
	for sourcing key supplies. Such consolidation, combined with a high volume of drilling units under construction, may result in a shortage of supplies and services thereby increasing the cost of supplies and/or potentially inhibiting the ability of
	suppliers to deliver on time, or at all. These cost increases, delays or unavailability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and result in drilling unit downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of our drilling
	units.





	Because the issuer does not have any independent officers, it will rely upon officers and affiliates of parent to identify and
	evaluate its prospective drilling contracts.





	The issuer does not have any employees and will rely entirely on
	parents employees to manage its business and operate its assets. The parent and its affiliates are not obligated to present issuer with potential drilling contracts and are not restricted from competing with the issuer for potential contracts
	or other future assets not securing the notes. Because parent controls the issuer and all of the other guarantors, the issuer will not be able to pursue or enter into any contract unless parent causes it to do so.





	While we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place, we are still exposed to potential risks from the requirement
	that we evaluate our internal controls under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.





	We have evaluated our
	internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal controls, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have performed the system
	and process evaluation and testing required to comply with the management certification requirements of, and preparing for the auditor attestation under, Section 404. As a result, we have incurred additional expenses and a diversion of
	managements time. While we have been able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of Section 404 in a timely fashion, we cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting
	will be adequate in the future to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If we are not able to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, we may be susceptible to
	sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our securities.





	Changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our financial results.





	Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, treaties and regulations, both internationally and
	domestically. Tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. We are subject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between the countries in which we operate. Our income tax expense is based upon
	the interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. A change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher tax expense or a
	higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings. If any country successfully challenges our income tax filings based on our structure or the presence of our operations there, or if we otherwise lose a material dispute, our effective tax rate on
	worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our financial results could be materially adversely affected.

	We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar
	worldwide anti-bribery laws.





	The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws
	generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. We operate in many parts of the world that
	have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our extensive training and compliance program, we cannot assure
	you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material
	adverse effect on our business and operations. We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and
	others in positions of influence or using other methods that U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations prohibit us from using.




	In order to effectively compete in some foreign jurisdictions, we utilize local agents and seek to establish joint ventures with local
	operators or strategic partners. Although we have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance, if we are found to be liable for FCPA or similar non-U.S. law violations (either due to our own acts or omissions, or due
	to the acts or omissions of others, including actions taken by our agents and our strategic or local partners, even though our agents and partners may not be subject to the FCPA), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions,
	which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.





	We face various
	risks in our relationship with F3 Capital and Hsin-Chi Su, its owner.





	As of September 30, 2012, on a fully diluted
	basis, F3 Capital owned approximately 34.5% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants. Through his ownership of F3 Capital, Hsin-Chi Su, a former director of the Company, has
	significant influence over all matters upon which shareholders may vote, including the election of our directors. The interests of F3 Capital and Mr. Su, on the one hand, and our shareholders, on the other hand, may differ, and neither F3
	Capital nor Mr. Su is under any fiduciary duty to consider the interests of our company or our shareholders. In fact, F3 Capital and Mr. Su may take action that they perceive benefits themselves and that may be detrimental to our other
	shareholders, our debtholders and, as a result, our employees as well.




	We have entered into various agreements with F3
	Capital and its affiliates that are publicly available and filed with the SEC. In addition, F3 Capital nominated four members of our board of directors. Because F3 Capital is our largest shareholder, our relationship could create, or appear to
	create, conflicts of interest, including when our board of directors is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and F3 Capital or its affiliates. The appearance of such conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize,
	might adversely affect the publics perception of us, the price of our securities as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our
	ability to do business.




	On August 21, 2012, we filed a lawsuit against Mr. Su in the District Court of Harris
	County, Texas. The complaint asserts breach of fiduciary duties, fraud, fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment and seeks to recover actual and punitive damages as well as other relief, in each case, relating to
	our past transactions with Mr. Su and F3 Capital, including our joint venture with Mandarin Drilling Company, an entity owned and controlled by Mr. Su, our acquisition of the

	Platinum Explorer

	from Mandarin Drilling Corporation and
	the financing thereof, and our option to purchase the

	Titanium Explorer

	. As of the date of this prospectus, we do not believe that Mr. Su has filed a response or answer to the lawsuit. We intend to vigorously pursue our claims, but we
	cannot assure you as to the outcome of this legal action or that Mr. Su will not file a counterclaim or other lawsuit against us. F3 Capital and Mr. Su could bring legal actions against us to




	 




	26








	Table of Contents




	preserve their own interests or make arguments that their interests have somehow been damaged by us, among other things, even if any such claims would be without merit. For example, they could
	claim that we violated an agreement with F3 Capital or make any other legal or equitable claims against us. We believe that any such claims would be without merit and we would contest them vigorously. The fact that we have sued Mr. Su may
	motivate F3 Capital or Mr. Su to take additional actions or positions that negatively impact the interests of other shareholders, debtholders or employees, including but not limited to voting against our existing board of directors when they
	stand for re-election. Finally, even if we prevail in any of these legal proceedings, we may not be able to collect any amounts or damages and these legal proceedings could result in the incurrence of significant legal and related expenses. Our
	ability to collect damages or recover legal and related expenses may be limited by several factors in addition to the outcome of the litigation, including but not limited to our ability to enforce any such awards in the various jurisdictions where
	F3 Capital and Mr. Su maintain assets. These risks and the perception of them could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and the price of our securities.





	Failure to timely commence contract operations for the



	Titanium Explorer



	may have a material and adverse effect on our business.





	We have secured a drilling contract for the

	Titanium Explorer

	and have commenced acceptance testing with Petrobras.
	However, if the

	Titanium Explorer

	is not acceptable to our customer, or if we are unable to commence timely with the

	Titanium Explorer

	, our drilling contract could be cancelled and/or we may be required to pay damages to our customer,
	and our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially adversely affected.





	Risks Related to
	the Notes






	Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent parent, the issuer and the other
	guarantors from fulfilling obligations under the notes and the guarantees.





	At September 30, 2012, after giving effect
	to this offering and the other Transactions, including the application of the proceeds of the offering of the old notes and the term loan, parent and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, would have had outstanding approximately $2.8 billion of
	senior indebtedness, $2.7 billion of which would have been senior secured first-priority indebtedness, and would have had $25.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement. Subject to the restrictions in the
	indenture governing the notes, we may incur additional indebtedness. Our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences for an investment in us and significant effects on our business. For example, our level of indebtedness and the
	terms of our debt agreements may:



	 





	 




	




	 





	make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under our indebtedness and our contractual and commercial commitments and increase
	the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;






	 





	 




	




	 





	prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase notes tendered to us if there is a change of control, which would constitute a default under
	the indenture governing the notes;






	 





	 




	




	 





	require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the notes and other debt, which would reduce
	the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;






	 





	 




	




	 





	limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments, or general corporate
	purposes, which may limit our ability to execute our business strategy;






	 





	 




	




	 





	heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities
	or making acquisitions;







	 




	27








	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;






	 





	 




	




	 





	limit managements discretion in operating our business;






	 





	 




	




	 





	limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	result in higher interest expense if interest rates increase and we have outstanding floating rate borrowings.







	Each of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and viability. Our ability to satisfy our other
	debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting our company and industry, many of which are beyond our control.





	The parent and the issuer may still be able to incur substantially more debt after the issuance of the notes. This could exacerbate the
	risks associated with their substantial leverage.





	Even with our existing level of debt, we and our subsidiaries may be
	able to incur substantial amounts of additional secured and unsecured indebtedness in the future, including debt under future credit facilities, some or all of which may be secured on a first priority basis with the notes, the note guarantees and
	the other pari passu obligations and to the extent that any such new indebtedness represents a permitted increase to our refinancing of our revolving credit agreement, it will rank ahead of the notes for purposes of priority of payment from proceeds
	of collateral (other than from insurance proceeds received as a result of an event of loss with respect to a vessel). As a result, any such debt could be secured by assets that secure the notes, the note guarantees and the other pari passu
	obligations which could dilute the value of the collateral securing the notes, the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations or could be secured by assets of a subsidiary of parent that is not a guarantor of the notes which would be
	effectively senior to the notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing any such debt. As of the date of this prospectus, we would have the ability to incur additional indebtedness under the indenture for the notes. Although the terms of
	the notes, the notes guarantees and the other pari passu obligations will limit our ability to incur additional debt, these terms do not and will not prohibit us from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt for specific purposes or under
	certain circumstances. In addition, the indenture governing the notes will allow us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances, which additional notes will also be guaranteed by the guarantors and will share in the collateral that will
	secure the notes, the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations. We may also incur other additional indebtedness secured by liens that rank equal to those securing the notes, the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations in
	which case, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share equally with the holders of the notes, the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations in any proceeds distributed in connection with our winding up, insolvency, liquidation,
	reorganization or dissolution. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face could intensify and could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.





	Parent, the issuer and the other guarantors may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet their debt service and other
	obligations, including the notes and guarantees and other pari passu obligations due to events beyond their control.





	The
	ability of parent, the issuer and the other guarantors to generate cash flows from operations and to make scheduled payments on or refinance their indebtedness, including the notes, and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures
	will depend on the ability of parents subsidiaries, including the issuer, to generate cash in the future. The future financial performance of parent and its subsidiaries will be affected by a range of economic, financial, competitive, business
	and other factors that they cannot control, such as general economic and financial conditions in their industry, the economy generally or other risks summarized here. A significant reduction in operating cash flows could increase the need for
	additional or alternative sources of




	 




	28








	Table of Contents




	liquidity and could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and the ability to service the debt and other obligations of parent, the
	issuer and the guarantors, including the notes, the other pari passu obligations, the F3 Capital Note and our convertible notes. If parent or the issuer is unable to service their debt or to fund their other liquidity needs, we may be forced to
	adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, seeking additional capital, or any combination of the foregoing. If parent, the
	issuer or any other subsidiary raises additional debt, it would increase interest expense, leverage and operating and financial costs. None of parent, the issuer nor any other subsidiary can assure you that any of these alternative strategies could
	be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that they would yield sufficient funds to make required payments on the notes and other indebtedness of parent, the issuer or any such subsidiaries or to fund their other liquidity needs. Reducing or
	delaying capital expenditures or selling assets could delay future cash flows. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including the indenture governing the notes, may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives.




	The failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could significantly adversely affect the
	value of the notes and the ability of parent, the issuer and the guarantors to pay amounts due under the notes and the guarantees. If for any reason parent, the issuer or any other subsidiary is unable to meet their debt service and repayment
	obligations, including under the notes, parent, the issuer or any such subsidiaries, as applicable, would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing their indebtedness, which would allow creditors at that time to declare all
	outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable. This would likely in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between their applicable debt agreements. Under these circumstances, lenders could compel parent, the issuer or any such
	subsidiaries, as applicable, to apply all of their available cash to repay borrowings or they could prevent parent, the issuer or any such subsidiaries from making payments on the notes. In addition, these lenders could then seek to foreclose on the
	assets of parent, the issuer or any such subsidiaries to the extent such assets are collateral for the borrowings. If the amounts outstanding under existing and future debt agreements of parent, the issuer or any other subsidiary, including the
	other pari passu obligations were to be accelerated, or were the subject of foreclosure actions, none of parent, the issuer or any other guarantor can assure you that their assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or
	to their other debt holders, including you as a noteholder.





	The parent and the issuer are holding companies and are dependent upon cash
	flow from subsidiaries to meet their obligations.





	The parent and the issuer currently conduct their operations through,
	most of their assets are owned by, and their operating income and cash flow are generated by, their subsidiaries. As a result, cash from their subsidiaries is the principal source of funds necessary to meet their obligations under the notes and any
	future debt service obligations. Contractual provisions or laws, as well as their subsidiaries financial condition and operating requirements, may limit their ability to obtain cash from subsidiaries that they require to meet their debt
	service obligations, including payments on the notes. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to them by their subsidiaries to further taxation.




	The inability to transfer cash from their subsidiaries may mean that, even though they may have sufficient resources on a consolidated basis to meet their obligations they may not be permitted to make the
	necessary transfers from their subsidiaries to meet such obligations.





	The indentures governing the notes and the indenture governing the
	existing notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on parent and the issuer that may prevent parent and the issuer from capitalizing on business opportunities and restrict their ability to take some actions.





	The indenture governing the notes and the indenture governing the existing notes contain covenants that restrict the ability of parent and
	the issuer to take various actions, such as:



	 





	 




	




	 





	paying dividends, redeeming subordinated indebtedness or making other restricted payments;







	 




	29








	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness or, with respect to restricted subsidiaries or any other subsidiary guarantor, issuing preferred
	stock;






	 





	 




	




	 





	creating or incurring liens;

	incurring dividend or other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries;

	consummating a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all their assets;

	




	 





	taking or omitting to take any actions that would adversely affect or impair in any material respect the collateral securing our indebtedness.







	The parent and the issuer may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise
	because of failure to meet certain ratios or because of the limitations imposed on them by the restrictive covenants under the indentures governing the notes and the existing notes. In addition, the restrictions contained in the indentures governing
	the notes and the existing notes may also limit the ability of parent and the issuer to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict their activities or business plans and adversely affect their ability to finance
	their operations, enter into acquisitions, execute their business strategy, effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted or engage in other business activities that would be in the interest of parent and the issuer. Parent
	and the issuer will also be subject to additional restrictions in the instruments and agreements governing the other pari passu obligations and in the future, may also incur additional debt obligations that might subject them to additional and
	different restrictive covenants that could further affect their financial and operational flexibility. Parent and the issuer cannot assure you that they will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason they are unable to
	comply with these agreements, or that they will be able to refinance their debt on acceptable terms or at all.




	The ability of
	parent and the issuer to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by events beyond their control, and neither parent nor the issuer can assure you that they will satisfy those requirements. A breach of any of these provisions could result
	in a default under the existing and future debt agreements of parent or the issuer, including the indentures governing the notes and the existing notes, the term loan or the revolving credit agreement, which could allow all amounts outstanding
	thereunder to be declared immediately due and payable. This would likely in turn trigger cross-acceleration and cross-default rights under the indentures governing the notes and the existing notes, the term loan, the revolving credit agreement and
	the terms of our other indebtedness outstanding at such time. If the amounts outstanding in respect of the notes, the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations or any other indebtedness outstanding at such time, were to be accelerated or
	were the subject of foreclosure actions, neither parent nor the issuer can assure you that their assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to other debt holders, particularly because some of the assets of parent,
	the issuer and the guarantors will be excluded from the collateral securing the notes.





	The issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes
	with cash upon a change of control or in connection with an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of an asset sale as required by the indenture.





	Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the notes), the issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding notes at a price equal to 101% of
	the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, up to, but not including the date of repurchase. In connection with certain asset sales, we will be required to offer to
	repurchase the notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, up to but not including the date of repurchase. In addition, in 2015 and 2017 we may be required




	 




	30








	Table of Contents




	to repurchase our convertible notes at the holders option and following a termination of trading event with respect to our ordinary shares, we will be required to offer to repurchase our
	convertible notes. The issuer may not have sufficient funds available to repurchase all of the notes and convertible notes tendered pursuant to any such offer and any other debt that would become payable upon a change of control or in connection
	with any asset sale offer, including under the instruments and agreements governing the other pari passu obligations. Any of the instruments and agreements governing the pari passu obligations or any other future debt agreements of parent or the
	issuer may also limit their ability to repurchase the notes until all such debt is paid in full. If the issuer fails to purchase the notes, it would be a default under the indenture governing the notes and the convertible notes indenture, which
	would in turn likely trigger a default under the instruments and agreements governing the other pari passu obligations and any future debt agreements. In addition, the occurrence of a change of control may also constitute an event of default under
	our existing and any future debt agreements. In that event, parent or the issuer would need to cure or refinance the applicable debt agreements before making an offer to purchase. Moreover, the issuer and parent anticipate that the existing or any
	future credit facility may restrict, and any future indebtedness they incur may restrict, the ability of the issuer to repurchase the notes and repurchase or repay other pari passu obligations, including following a change of control. The issuer and
	parent may be unable to repay all of that indebtedness or obtain a waiver of that type. Any requirement to offer to repurchase outstanding notes or to repurchase or repay other pari passu obligations may therefore require the issuer and parent to
	refinance other outstanding debt, which may not be able to be done on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. These repurchase requirements may also delay or make it more difficult for others to obtain control of the issuer and parent.




	Certain important corporate events, such as takeovers, recapitalizations, restructurings, mergers or similar transactions, may not
	constitute a change of control under the indenture governing the notes and thus would not permit the holders of the notes to require the issuer to repurchase the notes. In addition, the definition of change of control includes a phrase relating to
	the sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of parent, the issuer and the restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or issuer and the restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole. There is no precise
	definition of this phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the
	assets of parent, the issuer and the restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the issuer and the restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the holders
	of the notes have the right to require the issuer to repurchase such notes.




	Additionally, the exercise by the holders of
	notes and the lenders or holders of other pari passu obligations of their right to require the issuer to repurchase the notes or to repurchase or repay other pari passu obligations upon an asset sale could cause a default under the instruments and
	agreements governing the other pari passu obligations and any future debt agreements if the issuer is then prohibited by the terms of the applicable debt agreements from making the asset sale offer under any such instruments or agreements. In the
	event an asset sale occurs at a time when the issuer is prohibited from purchasing notes or repurchasing or repaying any other pari passu obligations, the issuer could seek the consent of its other applicable investors or lenders to the purchase of
	notes or the repurchase or repayment of any other pari passu obligations or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the issuer does not obtain a consent or repurchase or repay those borrowings, the issuer will
	remain prohibited from purchasing notes or repurchasing or repaying any other pari passu obligations. In that case, the issuers failure to purchase tendered notes or to repurchase or repay other pari passu obligations would constitute an event
	of default under the indenture, and the instruments and agreements governing the other pari passu obligations, as applicable, which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under the other indebtedness of the issuer and parent.

	As of the issue date of the notes, not all of parents subsidiaries will be restricted subsidiaries
	or guarantors of the notes, and parent and non-restricted subsidiary guarantors will not be subject to all of the covenants of the indenture.





	As of the issue date of the notes, not all of parents subsidiaries will be restricted subsidiaries under the indenture governing the notes and will not be guarantors of the notes, which means that
	these excluded parent subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants and other provisions of the indenture and the collateral agreements. In addition, although parent and certain of its subsidiaries that are guarantors but not
	restricted subsidiaries will provide a guarantee of the notes, they will only be subject to some covenants and other provisions of the indenture. For example, parent will not be subject to the restricted payments and asset sales covenants. One
	consequence of this structure is that parent, the non-restricted guarantors and excluded parent subsidiaries may engage in transactions that increase their credit risk. For example, parent could invest in entities and/or create new excluded parent
	subsidiaries to construct or purchase drillships or jackup rigs, such as parent had with the

	Tungsten Explorer

	prior to completions of this offering and the other transactions contemplated hereby, or have such subsidiaries finance the
	purchase of construction of drillships or jackup rigs with debt, equity or equity linked securities. The parent may also engage in certain transactions otherwise limited by the indenture and, as a result, parents guarantee would not be as
	strong as it otherwise would be absent such transactions. In addition, in the event of a liquidation, insolvency, bankruptcy or foreclosure relating to these excluded parent subsidiaries, the holders of the notes may only have recourse to the assets
	of these companies by virtue of parents guarantee and parents ownership of the equity of these companies, which means the holders of the notes will be effectively or structurally subordinated to holders of debt and other senior ranking
	instruments of these companies. As a result, holders of notes will only be able to look to the issuer, the restricted subsidiaries and any other subsidiary guarantors, as supported by parents guarantee, as the credit structure supporting the
	notes.





	If the notes are rated investment grade at any time by both Standard & Poors and Moodys and no default has
	occurred and is continuing under the indenture, certain covenants contained in the indenture will be suspended, and the holders of the notes will lose the protection of these covenants.





	The indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants that will be suspended and cease to have any effect from and after the first
	date when the notes are rated investment grade by both Standard & Poors and Moodys. See Description of NotesCertain Covenants. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional debt,
	make certain payments, pay dividends, sell certain assets and enter into certain types of transactions. Because these restrictions would not apply to the notes at any time the notes are rated investment grade, the holders of the notes would not be
	able to prevent us from, among other things, incurring substantial additional debt. If after these covenants are suspended, Standard & Poors or Moodys were to downgrade their ratings of the notes to a non-investment grade level,
	the covenants would be reinstated and the holders of the notes would again have the protection of these covenants. However, any indebtedness incurred or other transactions entered into during such time as the notes were rated investment grade would
	be permitted to remain in effect.





	There may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any portion of the notes, including because the
	other holders of pari passu obligations will have pari passu liens on the collateral securing the notes and the other pari passu obligations.





	The pari passu obligations, including certain other secured indebtedness that we may incur in the future, is or will be secured pursuant to the terms of the amended intercreditor agreement by pari passu
	first priority liens on the

	Emerald Driller

	, the

	Sapphire Driller

	, the

	Topaz Driller

	, the

	Aquamarine Driller

	, the

	Platinum Explorer

	, the

	Titanium Explorer

	and, upon delivery, the

	Tungsten Explorer

	,
	and by certain other of the issuers and the guarantors (other than parents) assets, subject to certain exceptions (including the exclusion of a pledge over any of our foreign accounts following repayment or repurchase of the
	existing notes), permitted liens and the amended intercreditor agreement and by a pledge of stock of the issuer and the guarantors (other than parent), to be shared on a pari passu basis amongst the holders of our pari passu obligations, including
	the notes.

	Neither parent nor the issuer can assure you that the value of the collateral securing the
	notes, the note guarantees and the other pari passu obligations would be sufficient to pay any amounts due under the notes, the note guarantees or any other pari passu obligations, after payment in full of obligations under the revolving credit
	agreement, if they were to be accelerated. We have not prepared a valuation or appraisal of the assets constituting the collateral. The value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the
	availability of suitable buyers for the collateral and the practical ability to foreclose on any such collateral would likely be costly. By its nature, some of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. The
	value of the assets pledged as collateral for the notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, competition or other future trends. In addition, the collateral securing the notes and note guarantees is subject to
	the pari passu liens securing the other pari passu obligations, as permitted under the terms of the indenture and the amended intercreditor agreement (and subject to the amended intercreditor agreement, certain debt may rank senior in right of
	payment to the notes in some respects) whether arising on or after the date the notes were issued; therefore, the collateral securing the notes and the guarantees (but not always the proceeds thereof) will be shared on a pari passu basis with the
	holders of the other pari passu obligations and other future debt, and such third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the collateral subject to such liens that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the collateral.




	With respect to some of the collateral securing the notes and the guarantees, the collateral agents security interest
	and ability to foreclose on the collateral will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third party consents, paying court fees that may be based on the principal amount of the pari passu obligations and making
	additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these consents, pay such fees or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the applicable holders and lenders will not be entitled to the collateral or any recovery with respect
	thereto. We cannot assure you that any such required consents, fee payments or filings can be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure and may delay
	any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral. Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the collateral may, without the appropriate consents, fees and filings, be limited.




	In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or a similar proceeding, neither the issuer nor parent can assure you that the
	proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the collateral will be sufficient to pay the pari passu obligations, including the notes, in full or at all, together with other claims that rank senior in right of payment and have first priority security
	interests in the shared collateral on a pari passu basis with the pari passu obligations. If the proceeds of any sale of collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the pari passu obligations, the holders of the notes and the holders
	and lenders of the other pari passu obligations (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the remaining assets of parent and the issuer and, in the context of a bankruptcy
	case by or against parent and the issuer, the holders of the notes may not be entitled to receive interest payments or reasonable fees, costs or charges due under the notes, and may be required to repay any such amounts already received by such
	holder.




	In addition, parent and the issuer may not perfect the liens on all of the collateral that is to secure the notes and
	the guarantees and the other pari passu obligations prior to the closing of this offering although we will enter into a further assurances covenant that will require us to use our commercially reasonable efforts to do so. Furthermore, the issuer
	will not be required to deposit any portion of the net proceeds from the Transactions to be applied to the final construction payment of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	into an escrow account in which the holders of the notes would have a perfected
	first priority security interest prior to the release of such proceeds to fund such final construction payment for the

	Tungsten Explorer

	, which is not expected to be delivered until the second quarter of 2013. As a result, there may not be
	sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes or any other pari passu obligations. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders or lenders of the pari passu obligations from the sale of the
	collateral securing the pari passu obligations will rank equally in right of payment with all of our unsecured senior indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables.

	The indenture governing the notes will not require that parent and the issuer maintain the
	current level of collateral or maintain a specific ratio of indebtedness to asset values. Releases of collateral from the liens securing the pari passu obligations will be permitted under some circumstances and may not require the collateral to be
	replaced.





	Under the amended and restated intercreditor agreement, the trustee will lose the ability to direct the pari passu collateral
	agent to take enforcement actions under certain circumstances.





	Pursuant to the amended and restated intercreditor
	agreement, the trustee initially is the sole controlling party for the purpose of directing the pari passu controlling actions to take enforcement actions relating to the common collateral. However, the trustee will lose this right, and the term
	loan administrative agent will become the sole controlling party, on the date that is 180 days after both the occurrence of an event of default under the term loan agreement and the receipt of written notice from the term loan administrative agent
	certifying that an event of default has occurred under the term loan agreement and that the term loan obligations are due and payable. If the pari passu collateral agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to
	all or a material portion of the common collateral or if the issuer or any guarantor that owns the collateral is then a debtor under an insolvency proceeding, the notice provided by the term loan administrative agent will be ineffective. In
	addition, the credit agreement agent will also have the right to become the sole controlling party if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the revolving credit agreement and at least 180 consecutive days have elapsed without the
	existing controlling parties diligently pursuing any enforcement action (assuming that the issuer or guarantor that owns the collateral is not a debtor under an insolvency proceeding). In order to exercise this step-in right, the credit
	agreement agent needs to provide written notice that it desires to become the sole controlling party and certify that such event of default has occurred and is continuing and the obligations under the revolving credit agreement are due and payable
	in full. In most circumstances, the exercise of this step-in right by the revolving credit agent will prevail over any similar right of the term loan agent.





	The collateral will be subject to casualty risks.





	The parent and the
	issuer will be obligated under the indenture and collateral agreements governing the notes to maintain adequate insurance or otherwise insure against hazards as is customarily done by companies having assets of a similar nature in the same or
	similar localities. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part, including windstorm insurance for drilling units operating in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, it is possible
	that the insurance proceeds will not compensate parent and the issuer fully for their losses. If there is a total or partial loss of any of the pledged collateral, neither parent nor the issuer can assure you that any insurance proceeds received by
	them or any of the guarantors will be sufficient to satisfy all of their secured obligations, including the notes.





	Rights of holders of
	notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings.





	The right of the collateral agent to
	repossess and dispose of the collateral securing the notes and the guarantees and the other pari passu obligations upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or
	against parent or the issuer prior to or possibly even after the collateral agent has repossessed and disposed of the collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the collateral agent for the holders of the notes, is
	prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use
	collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given adequate protection. The meaning of the
	term adequate protection may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditors interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional
	security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of




	 




	34








	Table of Contents




	the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the broad discretionary
	powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the collateral agent would repossess or dispose of the collateral, and whether
	or to what extent holders of the notes or holders or lenders under any other instruments or agreements governing pari passu obligations would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the collateral through the requirements of
	adequate protection. Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes or other pari passu obligations, the holders of the notes and holders
	of other pari passu obligations would have undersecured claims as to the difference. U.S. federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys fees for undersecured claims during
	the debtors bankruptcy case. Additionally, the collateral agents ability to foreclose on the collateral on behalf of the holders of pari passu obligations may be subject to the consent of third parties, prior liens and practical problems
	associated with the realization of the trustees security interest in the collateral. Moreover, the debtor or trustee in a bankruptcy case may seek to void an alleged security interest in collateral for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. It
	may successfully do so if the security interest is not properly perfected or was perfected within a specified period of time (generally 90 days) prior to the initiation of such proceeding. Under such circumstances, a creditor may hold no security
	interest and be treated as holding a general unsecured claim in the bankruptcy case. It is impossible to predict what recovery (if any) would be available for such an unsecured claim if the issuer or parent became a debtor in a bankruptcy case.
	While U.S. bankruptcy law generally invalidates provisions restricting a debtors ability to assume and/or assign a contract, there are exceptions to this rule which could be applicable in the event that the issuer or parent become subject to a
	U.S. bankruptcy proceeding.




	There also can be no assurance that courts outside of the United States would recognize the U.S.
	bankruptcy courts jurisdiction. Accordingly, difficulties may arise in administering a U.S. bankruptcy proceeding against the issuer or any of the guarantors with property located outside of the United States, and any orders or judgments of a
	bankruptcy court in the United States may not be enforceable in any foreign jurisdiction in which the issuer or any of the guarantors are organized. The rights of the collateral agent to enforce remedies may be significantly impaired by the
	restructuring or liquidation provisions of applicable jurisdictional bankruptcy laws, insolvency and other restructuring legislation if the benefit of such legislation is sought with respect to the issuer or parent. The risks outlined above
	regarding the difficulty of pursuing property that is collateral and that is located outside the United States is particularly relevant for parent, the issuer and the restricted subsidiaries since the drilling units that will serve as significant
	collateral for the notes and guarantees and the other pari passu obligations is often, if not usually, outside the United States. Further, the holders of the notes may receive in exchange for their claims a recovery that could be substantially less
	than the amounts of their claims (potentially even nothing), and any such recovery might consist of illiquid securities.





	Any future pledge
	of collateral may be avoidable in bankruptcy.





	Any future pledge of collateral in favor of the trustee or collateral agent,
	including pursuant to security documents delivered after the date of the indenture governing the notes, may be avoidable by the pledgor (a debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
	including, among others, if:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the pledgor is insolvent at the time of the pledge;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the pledge permits the holder of the notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had not been given; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge, or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.

	A financial failure by parent, the issuer or any of parents other subsidiaries may result in the
	assets of any or all of those entities becoming subject to the claims of all creditors of those entities.





	A financial
	failure by parent, the issuer or any of parents other subsidiaries could affect payment of the notes and other pari passu obligations if a bankruptcy court were to substantively consolidate parent, the issuer and some or all of parents
	other subsidiaries. If a bankruptcy court substantively consolidated parent, the issuer and some or all of parents other subsidiaries, the assets of each entity would become subject to the claims of creditors of all entities. Such a ruling
	would expose holders of notes and other pari passu obligations not only to the usual impairments arising from bankruptcy, but also to potential dilution of the amount ultimately recoverable because of the larger creditor base. Furthermore, a forced
	restructuring of the notes could occur through the cramdown provisions of the U.S. bankruptcy code. Under those provisions, the notes could be restructured over holders objections as to their interest rate, maturity and other
	general terms.





	Rights of holders of notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens on the collateral or
	on collateral acquired in the future.





	The failure to properly perfect liens on the collateral could adversely affect the
	collateral agents ability to enforce its rights with respect to the collateral for the benefit of the holders of the notes and the other pari passu obligations. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired
	after the grant of a general security interest or lien can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the trustee or the collateral agent will monitor, or that the issuer or
	parent will inform the trustee or the collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired
	collateral. The trustee and the collateral agent have no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of any security interests therein. Such failure may result in the loss of
	the practical benefits of the liens thereon or of the priority of the liens securing the notes against third parties.




	If the
	issuer, parent or any future guarantors were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding after the issue date of the notes, any liens recorded or perfected after the issue date of the notes would face a greater risk of being invalidated than if
	they had been recorded or perfected on the issue date. If a lien is recorded or perfected after the issue date, it may be treated under bankruptcy law as if it were delivered to secure previously existing debt. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced
	within 90 days of lien perfection, a lien given to secure previously existing debt is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date of the notes. Accordingly,
	if the issuer, parent or any future guarantors were to file for bankruptcy after the issue date of the notes and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, the liens securing the notes may be
	especially subject to challenge as a result of having been delivered after the issue date of the notes. To the extent that such challenge succeeded, you would lose the benefit of the security that the collateral was intended to provide.




	The issuer will receive the net proceeds of this offering, together with the proceeds of the term loan, at the closing but expects to use
	a portion of such proceeds for the final construction payment for the

	Tungsten Explorer

	after closing and to take delivery of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	in the second quarter of 2013. As a result, until the issuer or the applicable
	guarantor takes delivery of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	and the vessel is flagged, registered and mortgaged in favor of the holders of the notes and other pari passu collateral, it will not be part of the collateral. Consequently, if there is a
	bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the issuer and the relevant subsidiary that will own the

	Tungsten Explorer

	, noteholders will not have the benefit of having the

	Tungsten Explorer

	be part of the collateral. In
	addition, pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the applicable subsidiary that takes delivery of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	will have 20 business days to become a Guarantor if such subsidiary is not a guarantor at the time of such delivery.




	With respect to drilling units flagged under Panamanian law, the Panamanian recording procedure that will govern the part of
	the collateral that constitute Panamanian ship mortgages provides for a provisional registration




	 




	36








	Table of Contents




	of the Panamanian ship mortgages with the Panamanian ship registry valid for a six-month period. Prior to the end of that six-month period, the Panamanian ship mortgages must be translated into
	Spanish and protocolized by a Panamanian notary in order to be permanently registered with the Panamanian ship registry with a priority relation-back date to the date of the provisional registration. We are responsible for the permanent registration
	of the Panamanian ship mortgages in Panama, and if we fail to complete that permanent registration within the six-month period, the security constituted by the Panamanian ship mortgages will lapse and will no longer be valid or enforceable.





	There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the collateral securing the notes and guarantees will
	be released automatically, without holders consent or the consent of the trustee under the indenture governing the notes.





	Under various circumstances, some of the collateral securing the notes will be released automatically, including:



	 





	 




	




	 





	a sale, transfer or other disposal of such collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture governing the notes;






	 





	 




	




	 





	with respect to a contract unwind trigger (as such term is defined in the indenture governing the notes);






	 





	 




	




	 





	with respect to the collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee;






	 





	 




	




	 





	to the extent required in accordance with any intercreditor agreement; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	to the extent we have defeased or satisfied and discharged the indenture governing the notes.







	In addition, a guarantee will be automatically released in connection with a sale of such guarantor or a sale of all or substantially all
	of the assets of that guarantor, in each case, in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture governing the notes. The indenture governing the notes will also permit the board of directors of parent to designate one or more of our restricted
	subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If the board of directors of parent designates a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, all of the liens on any collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of
	its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture governing the notes. Designations of any unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the collateral
	securing the notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have claims to the assets of the
	unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries that are senior to any claims of the holders of notes.





	Foreclosing on the collateral may be
	difficult.





	Most or all of the collateral securing the notes, the guarantees and the other pari passu obligations will be
	located outside of the United States. In particular, the

	Emerald Driller

	, the

	Sapphire Driller

	, the

	Topaz Driller

	, the

	Aquamarine Driller

	, the

	Platinum Explorer

	, the

	Titanium Explorer

	and the

	Tungsten
	Explorer

	are highly mobile and are or may be located in international waters outside the jurisdiction of any court. If the issuer defaults under the indenture or if a guarantor defaults under its guarantee, subject to limitations in the amended
	intercreditor agreement, the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the notes may direct the trustee to instruct the collateral agent to bring a foreclosure action against the defaulting party. We cannot assure you that the
	collateral or the guarantees will be located in a jurisdiction having effective or favorable foreclosure procedures and lien priorities, particularly if it is routinely in transit. Any foreclosure proceedings could be subject to lengthy delays
	resulting in increased custodial costs, deterioration in the condition of the collateral and substantial reduction of the value of such collateral. In addition, some jurisdictions may not provide a legal remedy for the enforcement of mortgages on
	the collateral.




	Our vessels that are part of the collateral will be operated by us worldwide, as our business demands.
	Consequently, the respective laws of each jurisdiction where a vessel is actually located at the time the collateral




	 




	37








	Table of Contents




	agent may seek to enforce the ship mortgage will govern the foreclosure proceedings and distribution of proceeds. Such laws may vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Furthermore,
	all or some of those laws and procedures may be less favorable to mortgagees than those in other jurisdictions and may be less favorable than those applicable in the United States. The costs of enforcement in foreign jurisdictions, particularly if
	proceedings are ongoing simultaneously against vessels in different jurisdictions, can be high and can include fees based on the face amount of the mortgage(s) being enforced. Foreign court proceedings can also be slow and have unexpected procedural
	hurdles. Priorities accorded maritime lien claims and ship mortgages can vary in foreign jurisdictions, and some jurisdictions prefer certain local claimants (such as local suppliers of operating necessaries) to foreign claimants, such as the
	collateral agent or mortgagee. Consequently there are no assurances that the collateral agent will be able to enforce any one or more of the ship mortgages covering vessels that are located outside the United States.





	Maritime liens may arise and take priority over the liens securing the notes.





	The laws of the various jurisdictions in which the

	Emerald Driller

	, the

	Sapphire Driller

	, the

	Topaz Driller

	, the

	Aquamarine Driller

	, the

	Platinum Explorer

	, the

	Titanium Explorer

	and the

	Tungsten Explorer

	may operate may give rise to the existence of maritime liens which may take priority over the ship mortgages and other liens
	securing the notes and the guarantees and the other pari passu obligations. Such liens may arise in support of, among other things, claims by unpaid ship repairers remaining in possession of such collateral, claims for salvage, claims for damage
	caused by a collision, claims for seamens wages and other employment benefits and claims for pilotage, as well as potential claims for necessary goods and services supplied to such collateral. This list should not be regarded as definitive or
	exhaustive, as the categories of claims giving rise to maritime liens, and the ranking of such liens, vary from one jurisdiction to another. Maritime liens can attach without any court action, notice, registration or documentation and accordingly
	their existence cannot necessarily be identified.





	U.S. federal, state and foreign fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the
	notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees and require noteholders to return payments received. If this occurs, noteholders may not receive any payments on the notes.





	U.S. federal, state and foreign fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the notes and the incurrence of
	any guarantees. Under U.S. federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state and be different from other applicable foreign jurisdictions, the notes or guarantees
	could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if (1) the issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, issued the notes or incurred the guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (2) the issuer
	or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes or incurring the guarantees and, in the case of (2) only, one of the following is also true at
	the time thereof:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of
	the guarantees;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees left the issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small
	amount of capital to carry on the business;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the issuer or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that the issuer or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond the issuers or such
	guarantors ability to pay such debts as they mature; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	the issuer or any of the guarantors was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against the issuer or
	such guarantor if, in either case, after final judgment, the judgment is unsatisfied.







	A court would likely
	find that the issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee if the issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes
	or the applicable guarantee. As a general matter, value is given for a




	 




	38








	Table of Contents




	transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A debtor will generally not be considered to have
	received value in connection with a debt offering if the debtor uses the proceeds of that offering to make a dividend payment or otherwise retire or redeem equity securities issued by the debtor.




	The issuer cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not it or the guarantors were solvent at the
	relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that the issuance of the guarantees would not be further subordinated to the other debt of the issuer or of the guarantors. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent
	if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts,
	including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	it could not pay its debts as they become due.







	If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such
	guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the issuer or of the related guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such guarantee.
	In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, noteholders may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to other debt of parent and its
	subsidiaries that could result in acceleration of such debt.




	Although each guarantee entered into by a guarantor will contain
	a provision intended to limit that guarantors liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective to protect
	those guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that guarantors obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.




	In addition, different or additional fraudulent conveyance laws may exist in foreign jurisdictions which could result in the liens being avoided.




	If the guarantees by the subsidiary guarantors are not enforceable, the notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the
	subsidiary guarantors, including trade payables.





	The notes currently have no established trading market, and an active trading market may
	not develop for the notes, which could affect the liquidity and value of the notes and you may not be able to sell the notes readily, or at all, or at or above the price that you paid.





	The notes have no established trading market. The issuer does not intend to apply for the notes to be listed on any securities exchange or
	to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised parent and the issuer that they intend to make a market in the notes, but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making in the
	notes at any time, in their sole discretion. Even if a registration statement becomes effective to cover the notes, parent and the issuer cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the notes, or if one does develop, that it
	will be liquid. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, parents and the issuers credit ratings, parents and
	the issuers operating performance and financial condition and other factors. If an active trading market does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. As a result, parent and the issuer cannot ensure
	you that you will be able to sell any of the notes at a particular time, at attractive prices, or at all. Thus, you may be required to bear the financial risk of your investment in the notes indefinitely.

	Table of Contents




	If a trading market were to develop, future trading prices of the notes may be volatile and
	will depend on many factors, including:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the operating performance and financial condition or prospects of parent and the issuer;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the prospects for companies in the industry of parent and the issuer generally;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the number of holders of the notes;






	 





	 




	




	 





	prevailing interest rates;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the interest of securities dealers in making a market for them;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the market for similar securities and the overall securities market; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the ability of the issuer to complete the offer to exchange the notes.







	In addition, the market for non-investment grade debt has historically been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
	volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. Any such disruptions could adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from the
	initial offering price of the notes depending on the prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. As a result, we cannot ensure you that you will be able to sell
	any of the notes at a particular time, at attractive prices, or at all. Thus, you may be required to bear the financial risk of your investment in the notes indefinitely.





	The trading prices for the notes and the availability, costs and terms and conditions of our debt will be directly affected by our credit rating.





	The notes will be, and any of our future debt instruments may be, publicly rated by Moodys Investors Service, Inc., or Moodys,
	Standard & Poors Rating Services, or S&P, and other independent rating agencies. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. These public debt ratings may affect our ability to raise debt. Any future
	downgrading of the notes or our debt by Moodys and S&P or another rating agency may affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading price of the notes.





	Because the issuer and parent and certain restricted subsidiaries and guarantors are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face
	difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited.





	Parent, the issuer and certain restricted subsidiaries and guarantors are exempted companies incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and substantially all of their assets
	are located outside the United States. In addition, most of parents, the issuers and such restricted subsidiaries and guarantors directors and executive officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the
	United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets may be located outside the United States. Further, enforcement of the note guarantees issued and the collateral pledged may be subject to certain limitations under Cayman Islands law and
	the laws of various other foreign jurisdictions. As a result, it may be difficult for holders of notes to effect service of process within the United States upon non-U.S. directors or executive officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the U.S.
	courts against non-U.S. directors or executive officers.




	The corporate affairs of parent, the issuer and certain restricted
	subsidiaries and guarantors are governed by their memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law (2011 Revision) (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time) of the Cayman Islands, and the common law of the Cayman
	Islands. The rights of holders of the notes to take action against directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of directors under Cayman Islands law are, to a large extent, governed by the




	 




	40








	Table of Contents




	common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law,
	the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of directors under Cayman Islands law are different from those under
	statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws which may provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the United States, and
	some states, such as Delaware, which have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law.




	The Cayman
	Islands courts are also unlikely:



	 





	 




	




	 





	to recognize or enforce against parent and the issuer judgments of courts of the United States based on certain civil liability provisions of U.S.
	securities laws; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	to impose liabilities against parent and the issuer, in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, based on certain civil liability provisions of
	U.S. securities laws that are penal in nature.







	Additionally, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing
	to sue before the federal courts of the United States. There is no statutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, although the courts of the Cayman Islands recognize and enforce a non-penal judgment of a
	foreign court of competent jurisdiction without re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, provided such judgment:



	 





	 




	




	 





	is final;






	 





	 




	




	 





	imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given;






	 





	 




	




	 





	is not in a respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	was neither obtained in a manner, nor is of a kind enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.







	The Grand Court of the Cayman Islands may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought
	elsewhere.




	The laws of other non-U.S. jurisdictions where certain of the guarantors are formed or organized will govern the
	corporate affairs of such guarantors and the rights of holders of the notes to take actions to protect their rights to enforce judgments, enforce such guarantees or their rights to certain of the collateral.

	THE EXCHANGE OFFER






	Purpose and Effect of the Exchange Offer





	We sold $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the old notes in a private offering, which was completed on October 25, 2012. In connection with the offering of the old notes, we entered into a
	registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the old notes, pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange the old notes for the exchange notes. The registration statement of which this
	prospectus forms a part was filed in compliance with this obligation. We also agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC.




	Pursuant to the exchange offer, we will issue the exchange notes in exchange for old notes. The terms of the exchange notes are identical
	in all material respects to those of the old notes, except that the exchange notes (1) have been registered under the Securities Act and therefore will not be subject to certain restrictions on transfer applicable to the old notes,
	(2) will not have registration rights and (3) will not provide for any additional interest related to the obligation to register. Please read Description of the Exchange Notes for more information on the terms of the respective
	notes and the differences between them.




	We are not making the exchange offer to, and will not accept tenders for exchange
	from, holders of old notes in any jurisdiction in which an exchange offer or the acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdiction. Unless the context requires otherwise, the term
	holder with respect to the exchange offer means any person in whose name the old notes are registered on our books or any other person who has obtained a properly completed bond power from the registered holder, or any person whose old
	notes are held of record by The Depository Trust Company, or the Depository, who desires to deliver such old notes by book-entry transfer at the Depository.




	We make no recommendation to the holders of old notes as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering all or any portion of their old notes pursuant to the exchange offer. In addition, no one has been
	authorized to make any such recommendation. Holders of old notes must make their own decision whether to tender pursuant to the exchange offer and, if so, the aggregate amount of old notes to tender after reading this prospectus and the letter of
	transmittal and consulting with the advisers, if any, based on their own financial position and requirements.




	In order to
	participate in the exchange offer, you must represent to us, among other things, that:



	 





	 




	




	 





	you are acquiring the exchange notes in the exchange offer in the ordinary course of your business;






	 





	 




	




	 





	you are not engaged in, and do not intend to engage in, a distribution of the exchange notes;






	 





	 




	




	 





	you have full power and authority to transfer old notes in exchange for the exchange notes and that we will acquire good and unencumbered title thereto
	free and clear of any liens, restrictions, charges or encumbrances and not subject to any adverse claims;






	 





	 




	




	 





	you do not have and to your knowledge, no one receiving exchange notes from you has, any arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in
	the distribution of the exchange notes;






	 





	 




	




	 





	you are not a broker-dealer tendering old notes acquired directly from us for your own account or if you are a broker-dealer, you will comply with the
	prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of the exchange notes; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	you are not one of our affiliates, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act.







	Each broker-dealer that receives exchange notes for its own account in exchange for old notes, where such old notes were acquired by such
	broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such exchange notes. Please read Plan of Distribution.

	Table of Contents





	Terms of the Exchange Offer





	Upon the terms and conditions described in this prospectus and in the accompanying letter of transmittal, which together constitute the exchange offer, we will accept for exchange old notes that are
	properly tendered at or before the expiration time and not withdrawn as permitted below. As of the date of this prospectus, $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of old notes are outstanding. This prospectus, together with the letter of
	transmittal, is first being sent on or about the date on the cover page of the prospectus to all holders of old notes known to us. Old notes tendered in the exchange offer must be in denominations of principal amount of $2,000 and any integral
	multiple of $1,000. The exchange offer is not conditioned upon any minimum aggregate principal amount of old notes being tendered for exchange.




	We intend to conduct the exchange offer in accordance with the provisions of the registration rights agreement, the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and
	regulations of the SEC. Old notes that the holders thereof do not tender for exchange in the exchange offer will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest. These old notes will continue to be entitled to the rights and benefits such holders
	have under the indenture relating to the notes.




	Our acceptance of the tender of old notes by a tendering holder will form a
	binding agreement between the tendering holder and us upon the terms and subject to the conditions provided in this prospectus and in the accompanying letter of transmittal.




	The form and terms of the exchange notes being issued in the exchange offer are the same as the form and terms of the old notes except that:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the exchange notes being issued in the exchange offer will have been registered under the Securities Act;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the exchange notes being issued in the exchange offer will not bear the restrictive legends restricting their transfer under the Securities Act; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the exchange notes being issued in the exchange offer will not contain the registration rights contained in the old notes.








	Expiration, Extension and Amendment





	The expiration time of the exchange offer is 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on                     ,
	20    . However, we may, in our sole discretion, extend the period of time for which the exchange offer is open and set a later expiration date for the exchange offer. The term expiration time as used herein means the
	latest time and date to which we extend the exchange offer. If we decide to extend the exchange offer period, we will then delay acceptance of any old notes by giving oral or written notice of an extension to the holders of old notes as described
	below. During any extension period, all old notes previously tendered will remain subject to the exchange offer and may be accepted for exchange by us. Any old notes not accepted for exchange will be returned to the tendering holder after the
	expiration or termination of the exchange offer.




	Our obligation to accept old notes for exchange in the exchange offer is
	subject to the conditions described below under Conditions to the Exchange Offer. We may decide to waive any of the conditions in our sole reasonable discretion. Furthermore, we reserve the right to amend or terminate the exchange
	offer, and not to accept for exchange any old notes not previously accepted for exchange, upon the occurrence of any of the conditions of the exchange offer specified below under the same heading. We will give oral or written notice of any
	extension, amendment, non-acceptance or termination to the holders of the old notes as promptly as practicable. If we materially change the terms of the exchange offer, we will resolicit tenders of the old notes, file a post-effective amendment to
	the prospectus and provide notice to you. If the change is made less than five business days before the expiration of the exchange offer, we will extend the offer so that the holders have at least five business days to tender or withdraw. We will
	notify you of any extension by means of a press release or other public announcement no later than 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on the first business day after the previously scheduled expiration time.

	Procedures for Tendering







	Valid Tender






	Except as described below, a tendering holder must,
	prior to the expiration time, transmit to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the exchange agent, at the address listed below under the caption Exchange Agent:



	 





	 




	




	 





	a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, including all other documents required by the letter of transmittal; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	if old notes are tendered in accordance with the book-entry procedures listed below, an agents message transmitted through the Depositorys
	Automated Tender Offer Program, referred to as ATOP.







	In addition, you must:



	 





	 




	




	 





	deliver certificates, if any, for the old notes to the exchange agent at or before the expiration time; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	deliver a timely confirmation of the book-entry transfer of the old notes into the exchange agents account at the Depository, the book-entry
	transfer facility, along with the letter of transmittal or an agents message.







	The term
	agents message means a message, transmitted by the Depository to, and received by, the exchange agent and forming a part of a book-entry confirmation, that states that the Depository has received an express acknowledgment that the
	tendering holder agrees to be bound by the letter of transmittal and that we may enforce the letter of transmittal against such holder.




	If the letter of transmittal is signed by a person other than the registered holder of old notes, the letter of transmittal must be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer or exchange in
	satisfactory form duly executed by the registered holder with the signature guaranteed by an eligible institution. The old notes must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate powers of attorney. In either case, the old notes must be signed exactly
	as the name of any registered holder appears on the old notes.




	If the letter of transmittal or any old notes or powers of
	attorney are signed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers of corporations or others acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, these persons should so indicate when signing. Unless waived by us, proper
	evidence satisfactory to us of their authority to so act must be submitted.




	By tendering, each holder will represent to us
	that, among other things, the person is not our affiliate, the exchange notes are being acquired in the ordinary course of business of the person receiving the exchange notes, whether or not that person is the holder, and neither the holder nor the
	other person has any arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the exchange notes. Each broker-dealer that receives exchange notes for its own account in exchange for old notes, where such old notes were
	acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such exchange notes. Please read Plan of
	Distribution.




	The method of delivery of old notes, letters of transmittal and all other required documents is at your
	election and risk, and the delivery will be deemed made only upon actual receipt or confirmation by the exchange agent. If the delivery is by mail, we recommend that you use registered mail, properly insured, with return receipt requested. In all
	cases, you should allow sufficient time to assure timely delivery. Holders tendering through the Depositorys ATOP system should allow sufficient time for completion of the ATOP procedures during the normal business hours of the Depository on
	such dates.




	 




	44








	Table of Contents




	No old notes, agents messages, letters of transmittal or other required documents
	should be sent to us. Delivery of all old notes, agents messages, letters of transmittal and other documents must be made to the exchange agent. Holders may also request their respective brokers, dealers, commercial banks, trust companies or
	nominees to effect such tender for such holders.




	If you are a beneficial owner whose old notes are registered in the name of
	a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee, and wish to tender, you should promptly instruct the registered holder to tender on your behalf. Any registered holder that is a participant in the Depositorys ATOP system may
	make book-entry delivery of the old notes by causing the Depository to transfer the old notes into the exchange agents account. The tender by a holder of old notes, including pursuant to the delivery of an agents message through the
	Depositorys ATOP system, will constitute an agreement between such holder and us in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the letter of transmittal.




	All questions as to the validity, form, eligibility, time of receipt and withdrawal of the tendered old notes will be determined by us in
	our sole reasonable discretion or by the exchange agent, which determination will be final and binding. We reserve the absolute right to reject any and all old notes not validly tendered or any old notes which, if accepted, would, in the opinion of
	our counsel, be unlawful. We also reserve the absolute right to waive any irregularities or conditions of tender as to particular old notes. Our interpretation of the terms and conditions of this exchange offer, including the instructions in the
	letter of transmittal, will be final and binding on all parties. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities in connection with tenders of old notes must be cured within such time as we shall determine. Although we intend to notify you of defects
	or irregularities with respect to tenders of old notes, none of us, the exchange agent, or any other person shall be under any duty to give notification of defects or irregularities with respect to tenders of old notes, nor shall any of them incur
	any liability for failure to give such notification. Tenders of old notes will not be deemed to have been made until such irregularities have been cured or waived. Any old notes received by the exchange agent that are not validly tendered and as to
	which the defects or irregularities have not been cured or waived will be returned without cost to such holder by the exchange agent, unless otherwise provided in the letter of transmittal, as soon as practicable following the expiration date of the
	exchange offer.




	Although we have no present plan to acquire any old notes that are not tendered in the exchange offer or to
	file a registration statement to permit resales of any old notes that are not tendered in the exchange offer, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to purchase or make offers for any old notes after the expiration date of the exchange offer,
	from time to time, through open market or privately negotiated transactions, one or more additional exchange or tender offers, or otherwise, as permitted by law, the indenture and our other debt agreements. Following consummation of this exchange
	offer, the terms of any such purchases or offers could differ materially from the terms of this exchange offer.






	Signature Guarantees






	Signatures on a letter of transmittal or a notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed, unless the old notes surrendered for exchange are tendered:



	 





	 




	




	 





	by a registered holder of the old notes who has not completed the box entitled Special Issuance Instructions or Special Delivery
	Instructions on the letter of transmittal, or






	 





	 




	




	 





	for the account of an eligible institution.







	If signatures on a letter of transmittal or a notice of withdrawal are required to be guaranteed, the guarantees must be by an eligible institution. An eligible institution is an
	eligible guarantor institution meeting the requirements of the registrar for the notes within the meaning of Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act.






	Book-Entry Transfer






	The exchange agent will make a request to
	establish an account for the old notes at the Depository for purposes of the exchange offer. Any financial institution that is a participant in the Depositorys system may




	 




	45








	Table of Contents




	make book-entry delivery of old notes by causing the Depository to transfer those old notes into the exchange agents account at the Depository in accordance with the Depositorys
	procedure for transfer. The participant should transmit its acceptance to the Depository at or prior to the expiration time. The Depository will verify this acceptance, execute a book-entry transfer of the tendered old notes into the exchange
	agents account at the Depository and then send to the exchange agent confirmation of this book-entry transfer. The confirmation of this book-entry transfer will include an agents message confirming that the Depository has received an
	express acknowledgment from this participant that this participant has received and agrees to be bound by the letter of transmittal and that we may enforce the letter of transmittal against this participant.




	Delivery of exchange notes issued in the exchange offer may be effected through book-entry transfer at the Depository. However, the
	letter of transmittal or facsimile of it or an agents message, with any required signature guarantees and any other required documents, must be transmitted to and received by the exchange agent at the address listed under Exchange
	Agent at or prior to the expiration time.




	Delivery of documents to the Depository in accordance with the
	Depositorys procedures does not constitute delivery to the exchange agent.






	Determination of Validity






	We will determine, in our sole reasonable discretion, all questions as to the validity, form and eligibility of old
	notes tendered for exchange. This discretion extends to the determination of all questions concerning the timing of receipts and acceptance of tenders. These determinations will be final and binding. We reserve the right to reject any particular old
	note not properly tendered or of which our acceptance might, in our judgment or our counsels judgment, be unlawful. We also reserve the right to waive any defects or irregularities or conditions of the exchange offer as to any particular old
	note either before or after the expiration time, including the right to waive the ineligibility of any tendering holder. Our interpretation of the terms and conditions of the exchange offer as to any particular old note either before or after the
	applicable expiration time, including the letter of transmittal and the instructions to the letter of transmittal, shall be final and binding on all parties. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities in connection with tenders of old notes must
	be cured within a reasonable period of time.




	Neither we, the exchange agent nor any other person will be under any duty to
	give notification of any defect or irregularity in any tender of old notes. Moreover, neither we, the exchange agent nor any other person will incur any liability for failing to give notifications of any defect or irregularity.






	Acceptance of Old Notes for Exchange; Issuance of Exchange Notes






	Promptly after the expiration time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the exchange offer, we will accept all old notes
	properly tendered and issue the exchange notes, and return any old note not accepted for exchange. For purposes of an exchange offer, we will be deemed to have accepted properly tendered old notes for exchange when, as and if we have given oral or
	written notice to the exchange agent, with prompt written confirmation of any oral notice.




	For each old note accepted for
	exchange, the holder will receive a new note having a principal amount equal to that of the surrendered old note. As a result, registered holders of exchange notes issued in the exchange offer on the relevant record date for the first interest
	payment date following the completion of the exchange offer will receive interest accruing from the most recent date to which interest has been paid on the old notes or, if no interest has been paid on the old notes, from February 1, 2012. Old
	notes that we accept for exchange will cease to accrue interest from and after the date of completion of the exchange offer. Under the registration rights agreement, we may be required to make additional payments in the form of additional interest
	to the holders of the old notes under circumstances relating to the timing of the exchange offer.

	Table of Contents




	In all cases, issuance of exchange notes for old notes will be made only after timely
	receipt by the exchange agent of:



	 





	 




	




	 





	certificate for the old notes, or a timely book-entry confirmation of the old notes, into the exchange agents account at the book-entry transfer
	facility;

	Unaccepted or non-exchanged old notes will be returned without expense to the tendering holder of the old notes. In the case of old notes tendered by book-entry transfer in accordance with the book-entry
	procedures described above, the non-exchanged old notes will be credited to an account maintained with the Depository as promptly as practicable after the expiration or termination of the exchange offer. For each old note accepted for exchange, the
	holder of the old note will receive an exchange note having a principal amount equal to that of the surrendered outstanding note.






	Interest Payments on the Exchange Notes






	The exchange notes will
	bear interest from the most recent date to which interest has been paid on the old notes for which they were exchanged. Accordingly, registered holders of exchange notes on the relevant record date for the first interest payment date following the
	completion of the exchange offer will receive interest accruing from the most recent date to which interest has been paid. Old notes accepted for exchange will cease to accrue interest from and after the date of completion of the exchange offer and
	will be deemed to have waived their rights to receive the accrued interest on the old notes.





	Withdrawal Rights





	Tender of old notes may be properly withdrawn at any time before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the expiration date of the exchange
	offer.




	For a withdrawal to be effective with respect to old notes, the exchange agent must receive a written notice of
	withdrawal before the expiration time delivered by hand, overnight by courier or by mail, at the address indicated under Exchange Agent or, in the case of eligible institutions, at the facsimile number, or a properly transmitted
	Request Message through the Depositorys ATOP system. Any notice of withdrawal must:



	 





	 




	




	 





	specify the name of the person, referred to as the depositor, having tendered the old notes to be withdrawn;






	 





	 




	




	 





	identify the old notes to be withdrawn, including certificate numbers and principal amount of the old notes;






	 





	 




	




	 





	contain a statement that the holder is withdrawing its election to have the old notes exchanged;






	 





	 




	




	 





	other than a notice transmitted through the Depositorys ATOP system, be signed by the holder in the same manner as the original signature on the
	letter of transmittal by which the old notes were tendered, including any required signature guarantees, or be accompanied by documents of transfer to have the trustee with respect to the old notes register the transfer of the old notes in the name
	of the person withdrawing the tender; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	specify the name in which the old notes are registered, if different from that of the depositor.







	If certificates for old notes have been delivered or otherwise identified to the exchange agent, then, prior to the release of these
	certificates the withdrawing holder must also submit the serial numbers of the particular certificates to be withdrawn and signed notice of withdrawal with signatures guaranteed by an eligible institution, unless this holder is an eligible
	institution. If old notes have been tendered in accordance with the procedure for book-entry transfer described below, any notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at the book-entry transfer facility to be credited with
	the withdrawn old notes.




	 




	47








	Table of Contents




	Any old notes properly withdrawn will be deemed not to have been validly tendered for
	exchange. Exchange notes will not be issued in exchange unless the old notes so withdrawn are validly re-tendered.




	Properly
	withdrawn old notes may be re-tendered by following the procedures described under Procedures for Tendering above at any time at or before the expiration time.




	We will determine all questions as to the validity, form and eligibility, including time of receipt, of notices of withdrawal.





	Conditions to the Exchange Offer





	Notwithstanding any other provisions of the exchange offer, or any extension of the exchange offer, we will not be required to accept for exchange, or to exchange, any old notes for any exchange notes,
	and, as described below, may terminate the exchange offer, whether or not any old notes have been accepted for exchange, or may waive any conditions to or amend the exchange offer, if any of the following conditions has occurred or exists:



	 





	 




	




	 





	there shall occur a change in the current interpretation by the staff of the SEC which permits the exchange notes issued pursuant to the exchange offer
	in exchange for old notes to be offered for resale, resold and otherwise transferred by the holders (other than broker-dealers and any holder which is an affiliate) without compliance with the registration and prospectus delivery provisions of the
	Securities Act, provided that such exchange notes are acquired in the ordinary course of such holders business and such holders have no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the exchange notes;






	 





	 




	




	 





	any action or proceeding shall have been instituted or threatened in any court or by or before any governmental agency or body seeking to enjoin, make
	illegal or delay completion of the exchange offer or otherwise relating to the exchange offer;






	 





	 




	




	 





	any law, statute, rule or regulation shall have been adopted or enacted which, in our judgment, would reasonably be expected to impair our ability to
	proceed with such exchange offer;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a banking moratorium shall have been declared by United States federal or New York State authorities;






	 





	 




	




	 





	trading on the New York Stock Exchange or generally in the United States over-the-counter market shall have been suspended, or a limitation on prices
	for securities imposed, by order of the SEC or any other governmental authority;






	 





	 




	




	 





	an attack on the United States, an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism involving the United States, or any declaration by the
	United States of a national emergency or war shall have occurred;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a stop order shall have been issued by the SEC or any state securities authority suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement of which
	this prospectus is a part or proceedings shall have been initiated or, to our knowledge, threatened for that purpose or any governmental approval has not been obtained, which approval we shall, in our sole reasonable discretion, deem necessary for
	the consummation of such exchange offer; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in our business or financial affairs or any of our subsidiaries has occurred which is or
	may be adverse to us or we shall have become aware of facts that have or may have an adverse impact on the value of the old notes or the exchange notes, which in our sole judgment in any case makes it inadvisable to proceed with such exchange offer
	and/or with such acceptance for exchange or with such exchange.







	If any of the foregoing events or
	conditions has occurred or exists, we may, subject to applicable law, terminate the exchange offer, whether or not any old notes have been accepted for exchange, or may waive any such condition or otherwise amend the terms of such exchange offer in
	any respect. Please read Expiration, Extension and Amendment above.




	 




	48








	Table of Contents




	If any of the above events occur, we may:



	 





	 




	




	 





	terminate the exchange offer and promptly return all tendered old notes to tendering holders;






	 





	 




	




	 





	complete and/or extend the exchange offer and, subject to your withdrawal rights, retain all tendered old notes until the extended exchange offer
	expires;






	 





	 




	




	 





	amend the terms of the exchange offer; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	waive any unsatisfied condition and, subject to any requirement to extend the period of time during which the exchange offer is open, complete the
	exchange offer.







	We may assert these conditions with respect to the exchange offer regardless of the
	circumstances giving rise to them. All conditions to the exchange offer, other than those dependent upon receipt of necessary government approvals, must be satisfied or waived by us before the expiration of the exchange offer. We may waive any
	condition in whole or in part at any time in our sole reasonable discretion. Our failure to exercise our rights under any of the above circumstances does not represent a waiver of these rights. Each right is an ongoing right that may be asserted at
	any time. Any determination by us concerning the conditions described above will be final and binding upon all parties.




	If a
	waiver constitutes a material change to the exchange offer, we will promptly disclose the waiver by means of a prospectus supplement that we will distribute to the registered holders of the old notes, and we will extend the exchange offer for a
	period of five to ten business days, as required by applicable law, depending upon the significance of the waiver and the manner of disclosure to the registered holders, if the exchange offer would otherwise expire during the five to ten business
	day period.





	Resales of Exchange Notes





	Based on interpretations by the staff of the SEC, as described in no-action letters issued to third parties that are not related to us, we believe that exchange notes issued in the exchange offer in
	exchange for old notes may be offered for resale, resold or otherwise transferred by holders of the exchange notes without compliance with the registration and prospectus delivery provisions of the Securities Act, if:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the exchange notes are acquired in the ordinary course of the holders business;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the holders have no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the exchange notes;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the holders are not affiliates of ours within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the holders are not a broker-dealer who purchased old notes directly from us for resale pursuant to Rule 144A or any other available exemption
	under the Securities Act.







	However, the SEC has not considered the exchange offer described in this
	prospectus in the context of a no-action letter. The staff of the SEC may not make a similar determination with respect to the exchange offer as in the other circumstances. Each holder who wishes to exchange old notes for exchange notes will be
	required to represent that it meets the above four requirements.




	Any holder who is an affiliate of ours or who intends to
	participate in the exchange offer for the purpose of distributing exchange notes or any broker-dealer who purchased old notes directly from us for resale pursuant to Rule 144A or any other available exemption under the Securities Act:



	 





	 




	




	 





	cannot rely on the applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC mentioned above;






	 





	 




	




	 





	will not be permitted or entitled to tender the old notes in the exchange offer; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any secondary resale transaction.







	 




	49








	Table of Contents




	Each broker-dealer that receives exchange notes for its own account in exchange for old
	notes must acknowledge that the old notes were acquired by it as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities and agree that it will deliver a prospectus that meets the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any
	resale of the exchange notes. The letter of transmittal states that by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act.
	Please read Plan of Distribution. A broker-dealer may use this prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, in connection with the resale of exchange notes received in exchange for old notes that the broker-dealer
	acquired as a result of market-making or other trading activities. Any holder that is a broker-dealer participating in the exchange offer must notify the exchange agent at the telephone number set forth in the enclosed letter of transmittal and must
	comply with the procedures for broker-dealers participating in the exchange offer. We have not entered into any arrangement or understanding with any person to distribute the exchange notes to be received in the exchange offer.




	In addition, to comply with state securities laws, the exchange notes may not be offered or sold in any state unless they have been
	registered or qualified for sale in such state or an exemption from registration or qualification, with which there has been compliance, is available. The offer and sale of the exchange notes to qualified institutional buyers, as defined
	under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, is generally exempt from registration or qualification under the state securities laws. We currently do not intend to register or qualify the sale of exchange notes in any state where an exemption from
	registration or qualification is required and not available.

	Fees and Expenses





	We
	will pay the expenses of soliciting tenders pursuant to this exchange offer. We have agreed to pay the exchange agent reasonable and customary fees for its services and will reimburse it for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with
	the exchange offer. We will also pay brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in forwarding copies of this prospectus and related documents to the beneficial owners of old
	notes, and in handling or tendering for their customers. We will not make any payment to brokers, dealers or others soliciting acceptances of the exchange offer.

	Table of Contents




	Holders who tender their old notes for exchange will not be obligated to pay any transfer
	taxes on the exchange. If, however, exchange notes are to be delivered to, or are to be issued in the name of, any person other than the registered holder of the old notes tendered, or if a transfer tax is imposed for any reason other than the
	exchange of old notes in connection with the exchange offer, then the amount of any such transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder or any other persons) will be payable by the tendering holder. If satisfactory evidence of payment of
	such taxes or exemption therefrom is not submitted with the letter of transmittal, the amount of such transfer taxes will be billed directly to such tendering holder.





	Transfer Taxes





	We will pay all transfer taxes, if any, applicable to the
	exchange of old notes under the exchange offer. The tendering holder, however, will be required to pay any transfer taxes, whether imposed on the registered holder or any other person, if a transfer tax is imposed for any reason other than the
	exchange of old notes under the exchange offer.





	Consequences of Failure to Exchange Outstanding Securities





	Holders who desire to tender their old notes in exchange for exchange notes registered under the Securities Act should allow sufficient
	time to ensure timely delivery. Neither the exchange agent nor us is under any duty to give notification of defects or irregularities with respect to the tenders of old notes for exchange.




	Old notes that are not tendered or are tendered but not accepted will, following the completion of the exchange offer, continue to be
	subject to the provisions in the indenture regarding the transfer and exchange of the old notes and the existing restrictions on transfer set forth in the legend on the old notes set forth in the indenture for the notes. Except in limited
	circumstances with respect to specific types of holders of old notes, we will have no further obligation to provide for the registration under the Securities Act of such old notes. In general, old notes, unless registered under the Securities Act,
	may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.




	We do not currently anticipate that we will take any action to register the old notes under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws. Upon completion of the exchange offer, holders of the old
	notes will not be entitled to any further registration rights under the registration rights agreement, except under limited circumstances. Holders of the exchange notes issued in the exchange offer and any old notes which remain outstanding after
	completion of the exchange offer will vote together as a single class for purposes of determining whether holders of the requisite percentage of the class have taken certain actions or exercised certain rights under the indenture.





	Accounting Treatment





	We
	will record the exchange notes at the same carrying value as the old notes, as reflected in our accounting records on the date of the exchange. Accordingly, we will not recognize any gain or loss for accounting purposes. The expenses of the exchange
	offer will be amortized over the term of the exchange notes.





	Other





	Participation in the exchange offer is voluntary, and you should consider carefully whether to accept. You are urged to consult your
	financial and tax advisors in making your own decision on what action to take.




	We may in the future seek to acquire
	untendered old notes in open market or privately negotiated transactions, through subsequent exchange offers or otherwise. We have no present plans to acquire any old notes that are not tendered in the exchange offer or to file a registration
	statement to permit resales of any untendered old notes.

	Table of Contents











	USE OF PROCEEDS





	The exchange offer is intended to satisfy our obligations under the registration rights agreement. We will not receive any cash proceeds
	from the issuance of the exchange notes in the exchange offer. In consideration for issuing the exchange notes as contemplated by this prospectus, we will receive old notes in a like principal amount. The form and terms of the exchange notes are
	identical in all respects to the form and terms of the old notes, except that the transfer restrictions, registration rights and additional interest provisions relating to the old notes do not apply to the exchange notes. Old notes surrendered in
	exchange for the exchange notes will be retired and cancelled and will not be reissued. Accordingly, the issuance of the exchange notes will not result in any change in our outstanding indebtedness.








	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS





	In the ordinary course of our business and in connection with our financing activities, we have entered into a number of transactions with our directors, officers and 5.0% or greater shareholders, some of
	which are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. All of those transactions were approved by the unanimous vote of our board of directors. We believe that we have executed all of such transactions on
	terms no less favorable to us than could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. Our audit committee is responsible for approving related party transactions. The audit committee operates under a written charter pursuant to which all
	related party transactions are reviewed for potential conflict of interest situations. Such transactions must be approved by the audit committee prior to consummation.

	DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS






	F3 Capital Note





	On
	July 30, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% ownership interest in Mandarin Drilling Corporation (the owner of the

	Platinum Explorer

	) from F3 Capital, which we did not own pursuant to the Share Sale and Purchase
	Agreement dated July 6, 2010 between us and F3 Capital. The acquisitions total consideration was $139.7 million, consisting of (i) approximately $79.7 million in cash, including $64.2 million paid directly to DSME for installment
	payments on the

	Platinum Explorer

	, and (ii) the issuance of a promissory note in the principal amount of $60 million to F3 Capital (the F3 Capital Note) as described below.




	The F3 Capital Note bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum, accruing and compounding daily, and will mature 90 months after
	July 30, 2010, its issue date. We originally valued the F3 Capital Note based on our then weighted average cost of capital resulting in a discounted present value of $27.8 million. The F3 Capital Note could have become convertible into our
	ordinary shares upon approval by our shareholders at a conversion price of $1.10 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution covenants. At our shareholders meeting in January 2011, shareholders did not approve the conversion of the F3
	Capital Note. The F3 Capital Note also contains a preemptive right covenant that provides F3 Capital with the right to purchase a pro rata portion of any equity or convertible debt that we offer so long as the F3 Capital Note is outstanding if the
	price of the equity and convertible debt that we offer is less than the conversion price of the F3 Capital Note. Under the terms of the F3 Capital Note, if convertible, any principal amount that F3 Capital elects to convert would be reduced by any
	amounts owed by F3 Capital to Vantage International Management Co. or Vantage Deepwater Company. If we do not repay the F3 Capital Note on its scheduled maturity date or upon the occurrence of certain customary default provisions, the interest rate
	on any amounts outstanding under the F3 Capital Note will rise to 10% per annum.




	In connection with the Companys
	7.875% convertible notes offering in August 2012, the principal amount of the F3 Capital Note was reduced by $6.5 million to $53.5 million as consideration for an equal amount of convertible notes sold to F3 Capital in such offering. As a result,
	the Company recognized a charge of approximately $2.5 million.





	Revolving Credit Agreement





	In June 2012, we entered into a secured revolving credit agreement with Royal Bank of Canada to provide us with advances and letters of
	credit up to an aggregate principal amount of $25.0 million, maturing June 21, 2015. Advances under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at the ABR (as defined in the revolving credit agreement) plus a margin of 3.50% or LIBOR plus a
	margin of 4.50%, at our option. We may prepay outstanding advances subject to certain prepayment minimums at any time.




	The
	revolving credit agreement includes customary covenants and events of default, including covenants that, among other things, restrict the granting of liens on certain assets, restrict the incurrence of indebtedness and the conveyance of and
	modification to vessels and require us to maintain certain financial ratios and provide periodic financial reports. The revolving credit agreement also contains certain other covenants similar to those in the indenture governing the Notes. Advances
	under the revolving credit agreement are secured by a first-priority lien on certain of our assets, which are substantially similar to those assets to be pledged in connection with the notes.




	Pursuant to the amended intercreditor agreement, the issuer, the guarantors, the trustee, the credit agreement agent, the credit
	agreement collateral agent on behalf of the credit agreement secured parties, the term loan agent, the term loan collateral agent on behalf of the term loan secured parties, and the noteholder collateral agent on behalf of the existing notes secured
	parties amended and restated the existing intercreditor agreement, which relates to the relative rights of the revolving credit agreement lenders and the existing noteholders. The amended




	 




	53








	Table of Contents




	intercreditor agreement defines the rights of the holders of the pari passu obligations with respect to the collateral, and provide, among other things, that all indebtedness under the indentures
	governing the notes and the existing notes, and the other pari passu obligations will be secured by first priority liens on the collateral, which liens are intended to rank pari passu. See Description of NotesSecurityIntercreditor
	Agreement.




	As of September 30, 2012, we have not drawn any amounts under the revolving credit agreement.





	Convertible Notes





	On August 21, 2012, parent issued $56.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% Senior Convertible Notes due 2042 (the Convertible Notes) under an Indenture (as amended, the
	Convertible Notes Indenture) entered into on the same date with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee.




	The Convertible Notes will mature on September 1, 2042, unless earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed, and bear interest at a
	rate of 7.875% per annum, payable semiannually, in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2013.




	The Convertible Notes are convertible into the our ordinary shares, or a combination of cash and ordinary shares, if any, at our election, based upon an initial conversion rate of 476.1905 ordinary shares
	per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $2.10 per ordinary share). In addition, for any conversions prior to September 1, 2017, holders will be entitled to a conversion
	make-whole payment upon conversion.




	The Convertible Notes are subject to redemption by us at our option on or after
	September 1, 2015 and before September 1, 2017 if the volume weighted average price of our ordinary shares is greater than or equal to 125% of the applicable conversion price for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading
	day period. Further, the Convertible Notes are subject to mandatory conversion at our option on or before September 1, 2015 if the volume weighted average price of our ordinary shares is greater than or equal to 150% of the applicable
	conversion price for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period.




	We may redeem the Convertible
	Notes at any time on or after September 1, 2017 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Additionally, holders of the
	Convertible Notes may require us to repurchase the Convertible Notes, in whole or in part, for cash on September 1, 2015, September 1, 2017, or following a termination of trading event with respect to our ordinary shares at a price
	equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.




	The Convertible Notes are our senior unsecured obligation and rank equal in payment with our other senior unsecured debt but are structurally subordinated to the debt of our subsidiaries as the
	Convertible Notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries.





	Senior Secured Term Loan





	On October 25, 2012, we entered into a new $500 million senior secured term loan with Citibank N.A. as the administrative agent and
	Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as the collateral agent. The term loan will mature on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the loan. The proceeds from the term loan will be drawn in a single drawing on the closing date. The term loan will
	bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, (2) the prime commercial lending rate of Citibank, N.A. and
	(3) one percent per annum above the one-month adjusted LIBOR or (b) a LIBOR rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin.




	 




	54








	Table of Contents




	Any repricing amendment or refinancing through the issuance of any debt that results in a
	repricing event occurring at any time during the first year after the closing date will be accompanied by a 1.00% prepayment premium on the principal amount of the loans affected thereby or repaid, as applicable.




	Our term loan will include change of control and asset sale mandatory prepayment provisions consistent with the redemption and prepayment
	provisions applicable to the notes and existing notes as described under the captions Description of NotesRedemption and Offer to PurchaseChange of Control and Description of NotesRedemption and Offer to
	PurchaseAsset Sales. We are required to offer to prepay our term loan following the occurrence of a change of control at 101% of the outstanding principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repayment, on
	terms consistent with those applicable to the senior secured notes. We are also required to offer to prepay our term loan with excess proceeds from certain non-ordinary course dispositions of assets (other than deepwater vessels, which will not be
	permitted to be sold under the terms of the term loan).




	All obligations under our new term loan are fully and unconditionally
	guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the guarantors of the existing notes and the notes, and all such obligations and guarantees will be secured on a first-priority and pari passu basis by the Collateral securing the notes and other
	pari passu obligations. The agent for the term loan, the trustee for the notes and the agent for the credit agreement will enter into an intercreditor agreement governing the relationship between them as well as holders of any other indebtedness
	that is secured on a pari passu basis with the senior secured notes. See Description of NotesSecurityIntercreditor Agreement.




	Consistent with the indentures governing the notes and the existing notes, the term loan does not include any financial maintenance covenants, but will otherwise include customary events of default,
	customary representations and warranties and customary covenants, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, investments, asset sales, mergers and consolidations, prepayments of indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates and
	dividends and other distributions, in each case, consistent with comparable provisions applicable to the senior secured notes. Consistent with the indentures governing the notes and the existing notes, at any time that the term loan is rated
	investment grade, certain covenants contained in the term loan will be suspended.

	DESCRIPTION OF THE EXCHANGE NOTES






	The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture under which we issued $1.150 billion of senior
	secured first lien notes due 2019 and under which we will issued the exchange notes ( the notes) and the related Note Guarantees. The following description also contains a summary of the Collateral Agreements that we entered into in
	connection with the issuance of the notes. This summary does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read those agreements because they, and not this description, will define your rights as holders of the exchange notes.
	Copies of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral Agreements are available as set forth below under Additional Information. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description below under the
	subheading Certain Definitions. In this description, the Issuer refers only to Offshore Group Investment Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability, and any successor, and not to Vantage Drilling
	Company, its direct parent, or any of Parents other Subsidiaries.






	Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees





	The Issuer will issue the exchange notes under the Indenture with the Guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, National
	Association, as Trustee and Noteholder Collateral Agent. The terms of the exchange notes will include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the TIA.




	The exchange notes will be:



	 





	 




	




	 





	senior secured obligations of the Issuer;






	 





	 




	




	 






	pari passu

	in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, including the Existing Notes, and subject to the
	terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;






	 





	 




	




	 





	senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;






	 





	 




	




	 





	secured on a first priority

	pari passu

	basis with the Pari Passu Obligations by substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors
	(other than Parent), subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors.







	The exchange notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Parent, by each of the Issuers existing and future Subsidiaries,
	including any existing and future Subsidiaries that guarantee Obligations under any Credit Facility, and by certain of Parents other Subsidiaries. Each guarantee of the exchange notes will be:



	 





	 




	




	 





	senior secured obligations of that Guarantor;






	 





	 




	




	 






	pari passu

	in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of that Guarantor, including the Existing Notes, and subject to
	the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;






	 





	 




	




	 





	senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of that Guarantor; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	secured on a first priority

	pari passu

	basis with the Pari Passu Obligations by substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (other than
	Parent), subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens.







	None of the Excluded Parent Subsidiaries will
	be Restricted Subsidiaries or Guarantors, except under limited circumstances as set forth under the Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Additional Note Guarantees covenants,

	provided, however

	that (a) any Subsidiaries that are the direct or indirect owners of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	will become Restricted Subsidiaries and Guarantors within 20 business days after title to the

	Tungsten Explorer

	becomes legally vested in
	the applicable Subsidiary

	,

	and (b) upon entry into a Drilling Contract for the

	Tungsten Explorer

	, the Subsidiary that is the party (whether by novation or otherwise) to the Drilling Contract for the operation of the

	Tungsten
	Explorer

	, will be or become a Restricted

	Table of Contents




	Subsidiary and a Guarantor, in each case in accordance with the provisions described below under the caption Certain CovenantsAdditional Note Guarantees. The Subsidiaries
	that are or are expected to become Restricted Subsidiaries and Guarantors as described in this paragraph are listed below under Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.




	At December 31, 2011, after giving effect to the offering of the old notes and the other Transactions, the Issuer and the Restricted
	Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, would have had outstanding approximately $2.7 billion of senior indebtedness consisting of the notes, the Existing Notes, the amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and amounts outstanding under
	the Credit Agreement, and Parent and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, would have had outstanding approximately $2.8 billion of senior indebtedness consisting of the notes, the Existing Notes, amounts outstanding under the Term Loan
	Facility, the F3 Capital Note, the Convertible Notes, the Credit Agreement and short-term debt. In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors would have the ability to incur additional Indebtedness, including among other Indebtedness, additional
	Indebtedness under any Credit Facility not to exceed $200.0 million pursuant to the terms of the Indenture.




	The registered
	holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture.





	Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries





	As of the close of the offering, all of the Issuers Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries.




	Under the circumstances described below under the caption Certain CovenantsDesignation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries, the Board of Directors of Parent will be
	permitted to designate certain of the Issuers Restricted Subsidiaries or newly created or acquired Subsidiaries, if any, as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to many of the restrictive covenants in the
	Indenture and will not guarantee the notes.





	Principal, Maturity and Interest





	The Issuer will issue in this offering $1.150 billion in aggregate principal amount of exchange notes, assuming 100% of the old notes are
	tendered. The Issuer may issue additional notes under the Indenture from time to time after this offering. Any issuance of additional notes will be subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture, including the covenant described below under the
	caption Certain CovenantsIncurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock. The notes and any additional notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the
	Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. The Issuer will issue notes in a minimum denomination of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.




	Interest on the notes will accrue at the rate of 7.5% per year and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and
	November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2013. Interest on overdue principal and interest will accrue at a rate that is 2.0% higher than the then applicable interest rate on the notes. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the
	holders of record on the immediately preceding April 15 and October 15. Interest on the notes will accrue for any additional notes from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently
	paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. For the avoidance of doubt, all references to

	interest

	mean the initial interest rate borne by the notes and any increases in that
	rate to the extent overdue interest accrues on the notes, any Default Interest as set forth under Events of Default and Remedies.

	Table of Contents





	Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes





	Payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the notes will be made at the office or agency of the paying agent and
	registrar unless the Issuer elects to make interest payments by check mailed to the noteholders at their address set forth in the register of holders;

	provided

	that all payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the notes
	represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company (

	DTC

	) or its nominee will be made by the paying agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the
	holder or holders thereof.





	Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes





	Wells Fargo Bank, National Association will initially act as paying agent and registrar. The Issuer may change the paying agent or
	registrar without prior notice to the holders of the notes, and the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying agent or registrar.





	Transfer and Exchange





	A
	holder may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a
	transfer of notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The registrar will not be required to transfer or exchange any note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any note for a
	period of 15 days before a selection of notes to be redeemed.





	Note Guarantees





	The notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Parent and by each of the Issuers existing and future Subsidiaries,
	including any existing and future Subsidiaries that guarantee Obligations under any other Pari Passu Obligations, and by certain of Parents other Subsidiaries. The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The
	obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent that Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. See 

	Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and
	the NotesU.S. federal, state and foreign fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees and require noteholders to return payments received. If
	this occurs, noteholders may not receive any payments on the notes

	. If the Note Guarantee of a Guarantor is determined to be a fraudulent conveyance, holders of the notes may not receive any payment on the notes.




	A Guarantor may not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, consolidate with or merge with or into
	(whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person, other than the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary, unless:



	 





	 




	(1)




	immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and





	 





	 




	(2)




	either:





	 





	 




	(a)




	the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of
	that Guarantor under the Indenture and its Note Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee; or





	 





	 




	(b)




	the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture and the Collateral Agreements,







	provided

	,

	however

	, that the transfer, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, of all or substantially
	all of the assets of the Guarantors as a whole will be governed by the Merger, Consolidation; Sale of Assets and Asset Sales covenants and may be subject to the Change of Control covenant.

	Table of Contents




	The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor (other than Parent, except with respect to clause
	(4) below) will be released:



	 





	 




	(1)




	in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person
	that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer, a Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Merger, Consolidation; Sale of Assets or Asset
	Sales covenants and complies with the Collateral Agreements;





	 





	 




	(2)




	in connection with any sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of that Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
	transaction) the Issuer, a Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Asset Sales provisions of the Indenture and complies with the Collateral Agreements;





	 





	 




	(3)




	if Parent or the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
	Indenture; or





	 





	 




	(4)




	upon legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided below under the captions Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance and
	Satisfaction and Discharge.







	Security






	Collateral Agreements





	The Pari Passu Obligations will be secured by a
	first priority Lien on the Equity Interests of the Issuer and substantially all of the existing and future property and assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors (other than Parent), including the following:



	 





	 




	(1)




	the

	Emerald Driller

	, the

	Sapphire Driller

	, the

	Topaz Driller

	, the

	Aquamarine Driller,

	the

	Platinum Explorer

	, the

	Titanium
	Explorer

	and, when title thereto becomes legally vested in the applicable Guarantor, the

	Tungsten Explorer

	, as mortgaged under those certain Ship Mortgages dated the Issue Date or, in the case of the

	Tungsten Explorer

	, thereafter;





	 





	 




	(2)




	all other assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors (other than Parent), which will include accounts receivable (and supporting obligations related to the payment or
	performance thereof), general intangibles and equipment;





	 





	 




	(3)




	assignments of all insurance in respect of the Vessels and other applicable insurance of the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of other Collateral;





	 





	 




	(4)




	assignments of the earnings of the Issuer or any Guarantor or Internal Charterer that is party to a Drilling Contract;





	 





	 




	(5)




	the Tungsten Explorer Construction Assignment;





	 





	 




	(6)




	the Equity Interests of the Guarantors (other than Parent); and





	 





	 




	(7)




	assignment of the Earnings Account.






	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral will not include an assignment of the Drilling Contracts related to the Vessels because, as a general matter, the counterparties to these kind of contracts do
	not allow their assignment. However, the Collateral will include an assignment of the earnings from such Drilling Contracts and such earnings will be deposited into or forwarded to the Earnings Account, which will also be assigned as part of the
	Collateral. The Collateral also will not include (i) 

	de minimis

	or immaterial assets for which perfection of the security interests in such assets could not be obtained without unreasonable cost and expense or under applicable law,
	(ii) cash balances held in Foreign Deposit Accounts;

	provided

	that in no instance shall any Foreign Deposit Account have any cash balances greater than $5.0 million for any single Foreign Deposit Account and $25.0 million for all
	Foreign Deposit Accounts in the aggregate, in each case for more than 10 business days and




	 




	59








	Table of Contents





	provided further

	that cash balances greater than these respective limits (excluding any such amounts that are expected to be applied to satisfy local tax obligations, local law
	requirements, or to discharge local accounts payable obligations) are required to be swept or deposited into the Earnings Account with written notice to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent at such time within such ten business day period and
	(iii) any Pari Passu Excluded Collateral. In addition, the laws of some non-U.S. jurisdictions in which a Vessel may operate may require that a local resident of that jurisdiction be the Person who enters into the Drilling Contract with respect
	to a Vessel drilling in such local jurisdictions waters. In order to satisfy this requirement, the relevant Guarantor may enter into a Permitted Third Party Charter with such local resident for the relevant Vessel, and such local resident will
	enter into the Drilling Contract. The Issuer and the Guarantors will covenant that, in such a case, (x) the Issuer and the Guarantors will effectively retain operational control of the relevant Vessel, (y) the Issuer and the Guarantors
	will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such local resident to consent to the assignment of such Permitted Third Party Charter and (z) if such consent is received, the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will execute and deliver to the
	Pari Passu Collateral Agent an assignment of such Permitted Third Party Charter.




	The Liens will secure the payment and
	performance when due of all of the Note Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, in each case as provided in the Collateral Agreements. The Issuer and the Guarantors will cause the earnings derived from all Drilling Contracts to be deposited
	into the Earnings Account in accordance with the provision of the preceding paragraph and the Collateral Agreements.




	If
	property of a type constituting Collateral is acquired by the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than Parent) that is not automatically subject to a Lien or perfected security interest under the Collateral Agreements or there is a new Guarantor, then
	the Issuer or such Guarantor will, as soon as practicable after such propertys acquisition or such Subsidiary becoming a Guarantor and in any event within 20 business days or as soon as practicable where applicable local law requires
	additional time for compliance with applicable legal requirements, provide Liens having first priority over such property (or, in the case of a new Guarantor, all of its assets constituting the type that is Collateral) in favor of the Pari Passu
	Collateral Agent and deliver certain certificates (including in the case of real property, title insurance) in respect thereof as required by the Indenture or the Collateral Agreements and take all necessary steps to perfect the security interest
	represented by such Liens.




	So long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and subject to the
	Intercreditor Agreement, if any, and certain other terms and conditions, the Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to receive all cash dividends, principal, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the Collateral pledged by them
	and to exercise any voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral pledged by them, except in connection with a sale of any such Collateral which shall be governed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, including the
	Merger, Consolidation; Sale of Assets and Asset Sales covenants and the provisions of the Collateral Agreements as set forth under Release of Liens.




	Subject to the Collateral Agreements, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default:



	 





	 




	(1)




	all rights of the Issuer and the Guarantors to exercise such voting or other consensual rights will cease, and all such rights will become vested in the Pari Passu
	Collateral Agent, which, to the extent permitted by law, will have the sole right to exercise such voting and other consensual rights;





	 





	 




	(2)




	all rights of the Issuer and the Guarantors to receive all cash dividends, principal, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the Collateral will cease
	and such cash dividends, principal, interest and other payments will be paid to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent; and





	 





	 




	(3)




	the Pari Passu Collateral Agent may sell the Collateral or any part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Agreements.






	The Trustee will distribute all funds received by the Pari Passu Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
	holders of the notes in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Collateral Agreements.




	 




	60








	Table of Contents




	The Pari Passu Collateral Agent will determine the circumstances and manner in which the
	Collateral will be disposed of, including, but not limited to, the determination of whether to release all or any portion of the Collateral from the Liens created by the Collateral Agreements and whether to foreclose on the Collateral following a
	Default or Event of Default.





	Intercreditor Agreement





	The Trustee has entered into an Intercreditor Agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the 

	Intercreditor Agreement

	) with the Pari Passu Collateral Agent, the Noteholder
	Collateral Agent, the Credit Agreement Agent, the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, the Term Loan Agent, the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the trustee of the Existing Notes and the Existing Noteholder Agent with respect to the Common Collateral,
	which may be amended from time to time without the consent of the holders of the notes to add other parties holding Pari Passu Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Pari Passu Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Noteholder
	Collateral Agent will initially serve as collateral agent for all holders of Pari Passu Obligations (the 

	Pari Passu Collateral Agent

	).






	Rights of the Controlling Party






	Under the Intercreditor Agreement,
	the 

	Controlling Party

	 has the right to direct the Pari Passu Collateral Agent (i) with respect to foreclosures and (ii) to take other actions with respect to the Common Collateral (and the Authorized Representatives of
	the Non-Controlling Secured Parties shall comply with the instructions delivered by the Controlling Party with respect to the Common Collateral in connection with such foreclosures and other actions), and the Non-Controlling Secured Parties have no
	rights to take any action with respect to the Common Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement (other than at the direction or with the consent of the Controlling Party).






	Identity of the Controlling Party






	The following rules apply for
	determining the identity of the Controlling Party at any time that the Step-In Right is not in effect:



	 





	 




	(A)




	The Trustee is the initial Controlling Party and will remain the Controlling Party until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of Notes Obligations and (2) the
	Non-Controlling Party Enforcement Date (such date, the 

	Trustee Control Termination Date

	).





	 





	 




	(B)




	If any Term Loan Obligations are outstanding on the Trustee Control Termination Date, then the Term Loan Agent shall become the Controlling Party. The Term Loan Agent
	will remain the Controlling Party until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of the Term Loan Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Party Enforcement Date (such date, the 

	Term Loan Control Termination Date

	).





	 





	 




	(C)




	Immediately following the occurrence of both the Trustee Control Termination Date and the Term Loan Control Termination Date, the Controlling Party will be the
	Authorized Representative of the Series of Pari Passu Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of Pari Passu Obligations with respect to the Common Collateral (the 

	Major
	Non-Controlling Party

	).






	The 

	Non-Controlling Party Enforcement Date

	 is the date
	that is 180 days after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the Term Loan Facility or other applicable governing instrument for the Series of Pari Passu Obligations for which the Alternate Controlling Party is the
	Authorized Representative, as applicable, and (b) the Pari Passu Collateral Agents and each other Authorized Representatives receipt of written notice from the Alternate Controlling Party certifying that (i) such Authorized
	Representative is the Alternate Controlling Party and that an event of default, as defined in the Term Loan Facility or such other applicable governing instrument for that Series of Pari Passu Obligations, has occurred and is continuing and




	 




	61








	Table of Contents




	(ii) the Pari Passu Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the Term Loan Facility or
	such other applicable governing instrument for that Series of Pari Passu Obligations;

	provided that

	the Non-Controlling Party Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any
	Common Collateral (1) at any time that (A) the then current Controlling Party has commenced (or caused the Pari Passu Collateral Agent to commence) and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all or a material portion
	of such Common Collateral and (B) each other Authorized Representative has received written notice from the Controlling Party or the Pari Passu Collateral Agent thereof or (2) at any time an Issuer or the Guarantor that has granted a
	security interest in such Common Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.




	Without limiting the Credit Agreement Agents right to exercise the Step-In Right, until the Non-Controlling Party Enforcement Date with respect to the applicable Controlling Party (upon which the
	Alternate Controlling Party shall become the Controlling Party), (a) the Controlling Party shall have the sole right to instruct the Pari Passu Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to the Common Collateral, (b) the
	Pari Passu Collateral Agent shall not follow any instructions with respect to such Common Collateral from any Authorized Representative or other representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party or other Pari Passu Secured Party (other than the
	Controlling Party), and (c) no Authorized Representative of any Non-Controlling Secured Party or other Pari Passu Secured Party (other than the Controlling Party) will instruct the Pari Passu Collateral Agent to commence any judicial or
	non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise
	take any action to enforce its interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, the Common Collateral, except that each Pari Passu Secured Party (i) shall be entitled to take certain actions to preserve and
	protect their claims and interests with respect to the Pari Passu Obligations, to create, prove, preserve and protect the validity, enforceability, perfection and priority of the Common Collateral and actions that unsecured creditors are entitled to
	take, and (ii) must take certain actions in order to preserve and protect their secured claims if the failure to take any such actions could result in a loss of all or any material part of such secured claims, in each case of clauses
	(i) and (ii), to the extent not prohibited in the Intercreditor Agreement.






	Step-In Right






	The Credit Agreement Agent shall have the right to become the Controlling Party (such right, the 

	Step-In Right

	) at any
	time that the Credit Agreement Agent is not then the Controlling Party and (a) an event of default, as defined in the Credit Agreement, has occurred and is continuing, (b) (A) for a period of not less than 180 consecutive days
	(1) one or more Controlling Parties, collectively, have not commenced (or caused the Pari Passu Collateral Agent to commence) and have not been diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all or a material portion of such Common
	Collateral and (2) the Issuer or Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Common Collateral is not then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and (B) the Credit
	Agreement Agent has notified the Controlling Party and each other Authorized Representative that it desires to become the Controlling Party, and (c) the Credit Agreement Agent has certified to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent and each other
	Authorized Representative in writing that (i) an event of default, as defined in the Credit Agreement, has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Credit Agreement Obligations are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of
	acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the Credit Agreement.




	Immediately upon the exercise of the Step-In
	Right, (a) the Credit Agreement Agent shall automatically become the Controlling Party, (b) the 180-day period in the definition of Non-Controlling Party Enforcement Date with respect to the Credit Agreement Agent in its
	capacity as the Controlling Party shall be reset to zero and (c) the 180-day period in the definition of Non-Controlling Party Enforcement Date with respect to the Stayed Controlling Party shall be reset to zero and shall be stayed

	Table of Contents




	Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Party Enforcement Date, the Step-In Right shall permanently terminate (and shall no longer be exercisable) and the Stayed Controlling Party
	shall again become the Controlling Party.






	No Contest, Protest or Objection






	No Non-Controlling Secured Party (nor its Authorized Representative) may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or
	action brought by the Pari Passu Collateral Agent (on the instruction of the Controlling Party) or the Controlling Secured Party. Each of the Pari Passu Secured Parties has also agreed that it will not contest or support any other person in
	contesting, (i) in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the Pari Passu Secured Parties in all or any part of the
	Common Collateral, or (ii) the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.






	Waterfall






	If the Pari Passu Collateral Agent, upon instruction from the Controlling Party, is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any
	Common Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Common Collateral in any bankruptcy proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor or any Pari Passu Secured Party receives any payment with respect to any Common Collateral or the
	proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Common Collateral by the Pari Passu Collateral Agent, the proceeds of any such distribution or payment (subject, in the case of any such distribution, to the paragraph immediately
	following) shall be applied pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement in the following order of priority:





	First

	, to the payment of all unpaid fees, expenses, reimbursements and indemnification amounts incurred by the Pari
	Passu Collateral Agent and all fees owed to it in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Pari Passu Document;





	Second

	, to the payment of the Credit Agreement Obligations, including any interest, fees or other amounts that
	would have accrued on the Credit Agreement Obligations but for the filing of a bankruptcy petition with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor (regardless of whether allowed or allowable as a claim in any such bankruptcy proceeding);





	Third

	, after discharge of the Credit Agreement Obligations has occurred, to the payment of the other Pari Passu
	Obligations, including any interest, fees or other amounts that would have accrued on the applicable Pari Passu Obligations but for the filing of a bankruptcy petition with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor (regardless of whether allowed or
	allowable as a claim in any such bankruptcy proceeding),

	pro rata

	in accordance with the relative amounts thereof on the date of any payment or distribution; and





	Fourth

	, any surplus proceeds then remaining after the Discharge of all Pari Passu Obligations will be returned to
	the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.






	Refrain by Pari Passu Secured Parties; Payment Over






	Each
	Non-Controlling Secured Party acknowledges and agrees that the Pari Passu Collateral Agent shall be entitled, for the benefit of the Pari Passu Secured Parties, (a) to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of or deal with any Common Collateral
	that is not prohibited by the Intercreditor Agreement and (b) to act solely on the instructions of the Controlling Party to the extent that such instructions do not require the Pari Passu Collateral Agent to act in violation of the
	Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, without regard to any rights to which the Non-Controlling Secured Parties would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Pari Passu Obligations with respect to the applicable Series. In addition, none of the
	Pari Passu Secured Parties may seek to have any Common Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Common Collateral. If any Pari Passu Secured Party obtains possession of any Common Collateral or
	realizes any proceeds




	 




	63








	Table of Contents




	or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Pari Passu Obligations, then it must hold such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other Pari
	Passu Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Common Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.






	DIP Financing






	If an Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that (1) if an Issuer or any Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval
	of financing (the 

	DIP Financing

	) to be provided by one or more lenders (the 

	DIP Lenders

	) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code,
	each Pari Passu Secured Party agrees not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Common Collateral securing the same (the 

	DIP Financing Liens

	) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Common Collateral,
	unless any Controlling Secured Party, or an Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party, shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP
	Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Common Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party subordinates its Liens with respect to such Common Collateral on the same terms as the Liens
	of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any Pari Passu Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any
	such Common Collateral granted to secure the Pari Passu Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Common Collateral as set forth in the Intercreditor
	Agreement), in each case so long as:



	 





	 




	(A)




	the Pari Passu Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Common Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof
	arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other Pari Passu Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Pari Passu Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the
	commencement of the bankruptcy case,





	 





	 




	(B)




	the Pari Passu Secured Parties are granted Liens on any additional Collateral as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash
	Collateral, with the same priority vis-à-vis the Pari Passu Secured Parties as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement,





	 





	 




	(C)




	if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Pari Passu Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Intercreditor
	Agreement, and





	 





	 




	(D)




	if any Pari Passu Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash
	Collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection is applied pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement;







	provided

	that
	the Pari Passu Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of any Pari Passu Secured Parties of such Series that shall not constitute
	Common Collateral; and

	provided

	,

	further

	, that the Pari Passu Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other Pari Passu Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection
	granted to such Pari Passu Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash Collateral.






	Change in Pari
	Passu Obligations






	The Pari Passu Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Authorized Representative of each Series of Pari
	Passu Obligations, acknowledged that the Pari Passu Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other Pari Passu Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid,
	refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without




	 




	64








	Table of Contents




	affecting the priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement defining the relative rights of the Pari Passu Secured Parties of any Series.






	Payment Upon Event of Loss of a Vessel






	Notwithstanding the pro rata payment provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the Issuer or any Guarantor shall at any time, or from time to time, receive any net cash proceeds from
	the total loss of a Vessel, an amount equal to such net cash proceeds shall, in accordance with and to the extent required by the provisions of the Existing Indenture, the Indenture, the Term Loan Facility or any Other Pari Passu Facility, be
	applied as a mandatory prepayment of the applicable Pari Passu Obligations in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the terms of the foregoing Pari Passu Documents. The Pari Passu Collateral Agent is required to place (at the expense of
	the Issuer) Mortgagees interest insurance. Mortgagees interest insurance is intended to provide payment to the holder of a ship mortgage in the event there are no proceeds from the underlying hull policies in a total loss situation
	because the Issuer or relevant Guarantor has breached its warranties in the hull insurance policy. Such a breach would give insurance underwriters a valid defense to payment under the underlying hull policies.






	Other Pari Passu Obligations






	To the extent, but only to the extent permitted by the provisions of the Pari Passu Documents, the Issuer may incur or issue and sell one or more Series of Other Pari Passu Obligations. Any such
	additional Series of Other Pari Passu Obligations may be secured by a Lien that ranks pari passu with the Liens securing the Pari Passu Obligations, if and subject to the condition that the representative of any such additional class or Series of
	Pari Passu Obligations, acting on behalf of the holder of such Obligations, becomes a party to the Intercreditor Agreement by satisfying the conditions set forth therein.




	No provision of the Intercreditor Agreement can be terminated, waived, amended or modified (other than pursuant to any joinder agreement) without the consent of each Authorized Representative.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the consent of 100% of the holders of the applicable Series of Pari Passu Secured Obligations is required to approve any amendment or waiver of the Collateral Agreements that (i) except as permitted under the
	Intercreditor Agreement with respect to DIP Financings, subordinates the Liens of the Pari Passu Secured Parties to which such Pari Passu Secured Obligations are owed in the Common Collateral to any other Lien (other than Permitted Liens that, under
	the terms of Pari Passu Documents with respect to such Series are entitled to rank senior in priority to the Liens securing the Pari Passu Secured Obligations of such Series), (ii) effects any changes in the application of proceeds of the
	Common Collateral that would adversely affect such Pari Passu Secured Parties or (iii) makes any change in provisions dealing with the required vote of holders of the Pari Passu Secured Obligations of such Pari Passu Secured Parties required to
	approve any amendment or waiver. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, the Notes, any Collateral Agreement or any other Pari Passu Document, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall
	control.






	Single Set of Security Documents






	It is intended that none of the Pari Passu Secured Parties will cause or permit to exist any Liens on Common Collateral other than Liens
	in favor of the Pari Passu Collateral Agent securing the Pari Passu Secured Obligations and Liens under the Existing Collateral Agreements in favor of the Existing Noteholder Agent for the benefit of the Existing Notes Secured Parties. The
	Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions to give effect to this intention, to irrevocably appoint the Pari Passu Collateral Agent as agent for the Existing Noteholder Agent and to provide that the proceeds of any Common Collateral that is subject
	to any Lien under the Existing Collateral Agreements will be applied in accordance with the above waterfall.

	Table of Contents





	Release of Liens





	The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to releases of assets included in the Collateral from the Liens securing Note Obligations under any one or more of the following circumstances:



	 





	 




	(1)




	upon the full and final payment and performance of all Note Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors;





	 





	 




	(2)




	with respect to any asset constituting Collateral (other than the Capital Stock of the Issuer), if such Collateral is sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with
	the terms of the covenant entitled Asset Sales and the Collateral Agreements and the Issuer has delivered to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent an officers certificate certifying to such effect;

	provided

	that (a) any cash
	received from a disposition of Collateral will be required to be deposited in a deposit account controlled by the Issuer and held as Collateral subject to the Liens pending its application or use in compliance with the Asset Sales covenant and, from
	such deposit account, Parent, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may withdraw funds to deploy the proceeds of an Asset Sale in compliance with the Asset Sales covenant; and (b) to the extent that any disposition in such Asset Sale was of
	Collateral, the non-cash consideration received is pledged as Collateral under the Collateral Agreements substantially simultaneously with such sale, in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture and the Collateral Agreements;





	 





	 




	(3)




	upon legal or covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the notes as provided below under the captions Legal Defeasance and Covenant
	Defeasance and Satisfaction and Discharge;





	 





	 




	(4)




	with respect to an applicable Subsidiary, upon the occurrence of a Contract Unwind Trigger;





	 





	 




	(5)




	with respect to any assignment of rights under the respective terminated Internal Charter only, upon the occurrence of an Internal Charter Unwind Trigger; or





	 





	 




	(6)




	if any Guarantor is released from its Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture (including by virtue of such Guarantor ceasing to be a Restricted
	Subsidiary), that Guarantors assets will also be released from the Liens securing its Note Guarantee and the other Obligations.






	In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with the provisions of TIA Section 314. To the extent applicable, the Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with TIA
	Section 314(d), relating to the release of property or securities or relating to the substitution therefor of any property or securities to be subjected to the Lien of the security documents. Any certificate or opinion required by TIA
	Section 314(d) may be made by an officer of the Issuer except in cases where TIA Section 314(d) requires that such certificate or opinion be made by an independent Person, which Person will be an independent engineer, appraiser or other
	expert selected or reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, neither Parent nor the Issuer will be required to comply with all or any portion of TIA Section 314(d) if it determines, in
	good faith based on advice of counsel, that under the terms of TIA Section 314(d) and/or any interpretation or guidance as to the meaning thereof of the SEC, including no action letters or exemptive orders, all or any portion of TIA
	Section 314(d) is inapplicable to one or a series of released Collateral.





	No Impairment of the Security Interests





	Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor is permitted to take any action, or omit to take any action, which action or omission might or would
	have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral for the benefit of the Pari Passu Collateral Agent, the Trustee and the holders of the notes except as expressly set forth in the Indenture or the
	Collateral Agreements.




	Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor is permitted to take any action or otherwise attempt to enforce
	any claim or maritime lien against any Vessel that has priority over any claim or Lien of the Pari Passu Collateral Agent, the Trustee and the holders of the notes in respect of any Collateral, including any such claims or Liens arising under Ship
	Mortgages.




	 




	66








	Table of Contents




	The Indenture provides that any release of Collateral in accordance with the provisions of
	the Indenture and the Collateral Agreements will not be deemed to impair the security under the Indenture, and that any appraiser or other expert may rely on such provision in delivering a certificate requesting release so long as all other
	provisions of the Indenture with respect to such release have been complied with.





	Further Assurances





	Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will enter into (a) any agreement that requires the proceeds received from any sale of
	Collateral to be applied to repay, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire any Indebtedness of any Person, other than as permitted or required by the Indenture and the Collateral Agreements or (b) any amendment to, or other agreement in
	respect of, the Tungsten Explorer Construction Contract to the extent that any such amendment or agreement would be materially adverse to the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or the holders of the notes.




	To the extent that any instrument, Mortgage or other document is required to be delivered to give effect to and perfect the Liens
	(including with respect to the

	Tungsten Explorer

	when title thereto becomes legally vested in the applicable Guarantor), the Issuer and the Guarantors will be required to use their commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such instruments,
	Mortgages and/or other documents as soon as possible but in no event later than 20 business days following the Issue Date or, if an asset is acquired or delivered after the Issue Date, not later than 20 business days after such acquisition or
	delivery date;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that with respect to the Tungsten Explorer Construction Assignment, the Issuer and the Guarantors will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such assignment as soon as practicable to the
	extent the Issuer and the Guarantors are able to procure the relevant consents required for such assignment.




	Upon the
	occurrence of a Contract Winning Trigger, Parent or the Issuer shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to pledge its assets and property pursuant to the Collateral Agreements to become part of the Collateral subject to the Liens and shall perfect such
	Liens as soon as practicable but not later than 20 business days or as soon as practicable where applicable local law requires additional time for compliance with applicable legal requirements; and such Liens shall be released upon the occurrence of
	a Contract Unwind Trigger,

	provided

	that no assets or property have been transferred or sold, directly or indirectly, by the Issuer or a Guarantor to such applicable Subsidiary that is subject to the Asset Sales covenant.




	In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and the Issuer shall, and they shall cause any Guarantor to, at its sole cost and
	expense:



	 





	 




	(i)




	execute and deliver all such agreements and instruments and take all further action as the Pari Passu Collateral Agent or the Trustee shall reasonably request to more
	fully or accurately describe the property intended to be Collateral or the obligations intended to be secured by the Collateral Agreements;





	 





	 




	(ii)




	file any such notice filings or other agreements or instruments as may be reasonably necessary or desirable under applicable law to perfect the Liens created by the
	Collateral Agreements;





	 





	 




	(iii)




	use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (x) DSME to consent to the assignment of the Tungsten Explorer Construction Contract to the Pari Passu Collateral
	Agent, (y) Korea Eximbank to consent to the assignment of the Tungsten Explorer Refund Guarantee to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent, and (z) upon receiving either of such consents, to promptly assign such Tungsten Explorer Construction
	Contract and Tungsten Explorer Refund Guarantee, as the case may be, to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent; and





	 





	 




	(iv)




	not assign or grant a security interest or pledge in or of the Tungsten Explorer Construction Contract or Tungsten Explorer Refund Guarantee to any Person other than
	the Pari Passu Collateral Agent.

	In addition, the Ship Mortgages will contain customary mortgagor representations and covenants, including,
	but not limited to, Bahamian or Panamanian provisional and permanent registration, as applicable, limiting maritime liens, chartering, use and maintenance, class record inspection, vessel management and insurance (with named windstorm coverage
	exclusions in the Gulf of Mexico unless the insurance advisor to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent advises that such named windstorm coverage is available in the Gulf of Mexico on a commercially reasonable basis and customary with respect to the
	operation in the drilling industry of any Vessel in the Gulf of Mexico).





	Authorization of Actions to Be Taken





	Each holder of notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have consented and agreed to the terms of each Collateral Agreement, as
	originally in effect and as amended, supplemented or replaced from time to time in accordance with its terms or the terms of the Indenture, to have authorized and directed the Pari Passu Collateral Agent to enter into the Collateral Agreements to
	which it is a party, and to have authorized and empowered the Pari Passu Collateral Agent to bind the holders of the notes as set forth in the Collateral Agreements to which it is a party and to perform its obligations and exercise its rights and
	powers thereunder, including entering into amendments permitted by the terms of the Indenture or the Collateral Agreements.





	Certain
	Bankruptcy and Other Collateral Limitations





	The ability of the Pari Passu Collateral Agent, the Noteholder Collateral
	Agent, the Trustee and the holders of the notes to realize upon the Collateral may be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy. See 

	Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and the
	NotesRights of holders of notes in the collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings.

	 The ability of the Pari Passu Collateral Agent, the Noteholder Collateral Agent, the Trustee and the holders of the notes to
	foreclose on the Collateral may be subject to lack of perfection, the requirement of third party consents, local law, including those of foreign jurisdictions, prior Liens and practical problems such as lack of jurisdiction over a Vessel due to its
	physical location, associated with the realization of the Noteholder Collateral Agents Lien on the Collateral. See 

	Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and the NotesBecause the issuer and parent and certain
	restricted subsidiaries and guarantors are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited.

	




	The Liens on some of the additional Collateral securing Note Obligations were not be perfected as of the Issue Date. For
	example, Parent or its relevant Subsidiary is not scheduled to make the Tungsten Explorer Final Construction Payment under the Tungsten Explorer Construction Contract until the second quarter of 2013 and therefore the relevant Guarantor did not take
	delivery of this Vessel by the Issue Date. As a result, some of the instruments and other documents required to perfect or enhance the priority of a perfected security interest in certain types of Collateral (

	e.g.

	, the Mortgage in respect of
	the

	Tungsten Explorer

	, the earnings from any Tungsten Explorer Drilling Contract, deposit accounts and securities accounts) were not scheduled to be delivered on or prior to the Issue Date. For so long as, and to the extent, these Liens
	remain unperfected, holders of the notes may not be able to realize the full value of the security interest in such Collateral if their position as secured creditors is challenged by another party, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries file for bankruptcy
	or insolvency, DSME files for bankruptcy or insolvency or there is a related foreclosure action on these assets. In addition, the Issuer will not be required to deposit any portion of the net proceeds from the Transactions into an escrow account in
	which the holders of the notes would have a perfected first priority security interest prior to the release of such proceeds to fund the Tungsten Explorer Final Construction Payment, which is not expected to be delivered until the second quarter of
	2013. See 

	Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and the NotesThere may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any portion of the notes, including because the other holders of pari passu obligations will have pari
	passu liens on the collateral securing the notes and the other pari passu obligations.

	

	Table of Contents




	Additionally, the Pari Passu Collateral Agent may need to evaluate the impact of the
	potential liabilities before determining to foreclose on the Vessels, on any assignment of Equity Interests or on any Collateral consisting of any real property because a secured creditor that holds a Lien on any thereof may be held liable under
	environmental laws for the costs of remediating or preventing releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances from vessels or at such real property or become liable for other obligations of the Issuer or relevant Guarantor such as maritime
	liens. Consequently, the Pari Passu Collateral Agent may decline to foreclose on such Collateral or exercise remedies available if it does not receive indemnification to its satisfaction from the holders of the notes.




	Subject to the restrictions on incurring Indebtedness and granting Liens in respect thereof in the Indenture or other Pari Passu
	Document, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Restricted Subsidiaries will also have the right, among other things, to incur Indebtedness, including, without limitation, Capital Lease Obligations and mortgage and purchase money obligations and
	acquire assets with the proceeds of such Indebtedness, which assets could be subject to Liens that secures such Indebtedness. To the extent third parties hold Liens (whether or not such Liens are Permitted Liens), such third parties may have
	rights and remedies with respect to the assets subject to such Liens that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the Noteholder Collateral Agents remedies. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be
	illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value and any sale of such Collateral separately from the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors as a whole may not be feasible. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be
	sold in a short period of time, if at all. See 

	Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and the NotesThere may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any portion of the notes, including because the other holders of pari
	passu obligations will have pari passu liens on the collateral securing the notes and the other pari passu obligations.

	 The enforceability of any of the arrangements set forth in any intercreditor agreement may be subject to the
	application of insolvency laws outside the United States. See 

	Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and the NotesForeclosing on the collateral may be difficult.

	Withholding Taxes





	All
	payments made on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor under or with respect to the notes or the Note Guarantees must be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy,
	impost, assessment or other governmental charge (including penalties, interest and other liabilities related thereto) imposed or levied by or on behalf of any Specified Tax Jurisdiction or by any authority or agency therein or thereof having power
	to tax (or the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of any successor of the Issuer or any Guarantor) (hereinafter 

	Taxes

	), unless the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, as applicable, are required to withhold or deduct
	Taxes by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof by the relevant government authority or agency. If the Issuer or any Guarantor (or any successor of any of them), as applicable, are so required to withhold or deduct any amount for or
	on account of Taxes from any payment made under or with respect to the notes or the Note Guarantee, the Issuer or such Guarantor (or any successor of any of them), as applicable, will be required to pay such additional amounts (

	Additional
	Amounts

	) as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will not be less than the amount the holder would have received if such Taxes had not been
	withheld or deducted;

	provided, however

	, that no Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to payments made to a holder (an 

	Excluded Holder

	) in respect of a beneficial owner (i) which is subject to such Taxes by
	reason of its being connected with any Specified Tax Jurisdiction otherwise than by the mere holding of notes or the receipt of payments thereunder (or under the related Note Guarantee), (ii) which presents any note for payment of principal

	applicable 30-day period, (iii) which failed duly and timely to comply with a reasonable, timely request of the Issuer to provide information, documents or other evidence concerning the holders nationality, residence, entitlement to

	full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant authority as and when required in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or any applicable Guarantor (or any successor of any of them), as applicable, will furnish to the Trustee, within 30 days
	after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law, copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Issuer or such Guarantor (or any successor of any of them), as applicable, (i) in such form as provided in the
	normal course by the taxing authority imposing such Taxes and as is reasonably available to the Issuer or such Guarantor (or any successor of any of them), as applicable, and (ii) certified by such taxing authority (or, if no such certification
	is available from such taxing authority, then by means of an officers certificate from the Issuer or such Guarantor (or any successor of any of them), as applicable). The Trustee shall thereafter make such evidence available to the holders
	upon request. The Issuer or any Guarantor (or any successor of any of them), as applicable, will upon written request of each holder (other than an Excluded Holder), reimburse each such holder for the amount of (i) any Taxes so levied or
	imposed and paid by such holder as a result of payments made under or with respect to the notes, the Note Guarantee or a mortgaged Vessel, as applicable, and (ii) any Taxes imposed with respect to any such reimbursement under the immediately
	preceding clause (i), but excluding any Taxes on such holders net income, so that the net amount received by such holder after such reimbursement will not be less than the net amount the holder would have received if Taxes (other than such
	Taxes on such holders net income) on such reimbursement had not been imposed.




	Whenever in the Indenture there is
	mentioned, in any context, (a) the payment of principal, (b) purchase or redemption prices in connection with a purchase or redemption of notes, (c) interest or (d) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the notes,
	or any payment pursuant to the Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided for in this section to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in
	respect thereof.




	The foregoing obligations shall survive any defeasance or discharge of the Indenture.




	The Issuer or the Guarantors will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes,
	charges or similar levies that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of the notes, the Note Guarantee or a Mortgage or other Collateral Agreement or any other document or instrument in relation thereto,
	or the receipt of any payments with respect to the notes, the Note Guarantee or a Mortgage or other Collateral Agreement, excluding such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction outside of any Specified Tax Jurisdiction, the
	jurisdiction of incorporation of any successor of the Issuer or any jurisdiction in which a paying agent is located, and has agreed to indemnify the holders for any such taxes paid by such holders.

	Redemption & Offer to Purchase






	Optional Redemption







	Optional Redemption Prior to November 1,
	2015.


	At any time prior to November 1, 2015, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of notes, at one time or from time to time, issued under the Indenture (which amount includes additional
	notes, if any) at a redemption price equal to 107.5% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to the applicable Redemption Date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings;

	provided

	that:



	 





	 




	(1)




	at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of notes (including any additional notes) issued under the Indenture (excluding notes held by the Issuer and its
	Subsidiaries) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and





	 





	 




	(2)




	the redemption occurs within 60 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.








	Optional Redemption On and After November 1, 2015.


	 On or after November 1, 2015, the Issuer may redeem the
	notes, in whole or in part, at one time or from time to time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest
	and Additional Interest, if any, on the notes redeemed, to the applicable Redemption Date, if redeemed during the periods indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant
	interest payment date:

	Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
	notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable Redemption Date.






	Optional Redemption Prior to
	November 1, 2015.


	 At any time prior to November 1, 2015, the Issuer may also, at its option, redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at one time or from time to time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior
	notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the rights of
	holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date in respect of then outstanding notes.





	Optional Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes





	At any time, the
	Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the notes, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable Redemption
	Date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), in the event that the Issuer or the Guarantors, as the case may be, has become or would become obligated to
	pay, on the next date on which any amount would be payable with respect to the notes, any Additional Amounts as a result of a change in or an amendment to the laws (including any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of any Specified Tax
	Jurisdiction (or any relevant jurisdiction, political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in or amendment to any official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings
	(including a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction), which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after the date of the Indenture, and the Issuer or the Guarantors, as the case may be, cannot avoid such obligation by
	taking reasonable measures available to them;

	provided

	that, (1) the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith that the aggregate amount of such Additional Amounts would create additional annual




	 




	71








	Table of Contents




	costs in excess of 0.50% of the aggregate principal amount of notes then outstanding; and (2) (a) no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest
	date on which the Issuer or the Guarantors, as the case may be, would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the notes or the Note Guarantee were then due, and (b) at the time any such redemption notice is given,
	such obligation to pay Additional Amounts must remain in effect. Prior to any redemption of the notes, the Issuer will be required to deliver to the Trustee (i) an officers certificate stating that (x) the Issuer or the Guarantors,
	as the case may be, cannot avoid obligations to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to them and (y) the Issuer is otherwise entitled to effect such redemption and attaching the resolutions of the Board of Directors of
	Parent as to additional annual costs described above and (ii) an opinion of independent legal counsel of recognized standing stating that the Issuer would be obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a change in tax laws or regulations
	and, in the case of (i) and (ii), stating that the conditions precedent to the right of redemption have occurred. No such notice of redemption may be given more than 60 days before or more than 270 days after the Issuer or any Guarantors, as
	the case may be, first becomes liable or aware of the liability to pay any Additional Amounts as a result of a change or amendment described above.





	Mandatory Redemption Upon Event of Loss of a Vessel





	Upon the occurrence or
	happening of any Event of Loss, the Issuer shall be required to redeem notes and other Pari Passu Obligations containing provisions similar to those set forth in the Indenture with respect to a redemption upon an Event of Loss, the maximum principal
	amount of notes and such other Pari Passu Obligations that may be purchased out of the Event of Loss Proceeds received in respect of such loss (rounded to the nearest $1,000) upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice to the Trustee,
	at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes redeemed to the applicable Redemption Date. The Issuer shall deliver the redemption notice to the holders of the notes within
	30 days of the receipt of any Event of Loss Proceeds. If the aggregate principal amount of notes and other Pari Passu Obligations exceeds the amount of Event of Loss Proceeds, the Pari Passu Collateral Agent shall select notes and such other
	Pari Passu Obligations to be redeemed on a

	pro rata

	basis. All Event of Loss Proceeds received in respect of an Event of Loss will be required to be deposited in a deposit account controlled by the Pari Passu Collateral Agent and held as
	Common Collateral subject to a Lien under the Collateral Agreements pending their application to redemption of notes and such other Pari Passu Obligations and, from such deposit account, the Pari Passu Collateral Agent may withdraw funds to deploy
	the Event of Loss Proceeds in compliance with the foregoing.





	Change of Control





	If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to a
	minimum amount of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000) of that holders notes pursuant to a change of control offer (a 

	Change of Control Offer

	) on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the
	Issuer will offer a payment (the 

	Change of Control Payment

	) in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes repurchased to the date of purchase, subject to
	the rights of holders of notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within ten business days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice to the Trustee and each holder
	describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60
	days from the date such notice is sent (the 

	Change of Control Payment Date

	), pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
	Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any
	securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of
	Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.




	 




	72








	Table of Contents




	On or before the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:



	 





	 




	(1)




	accept for payment all notes or portions of notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;





	 





	 




	(2)




	deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or portions of notes properly tendered; and





	 





	 




	(3)




	deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the notes properly accepted together with an officers certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes
	or portions of notes being purchased by the Issuer.






	The paying agent will promptly send to each holder of notes properly
	tendered the Change of Control Payment for such notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes
	surrendered, if any;

	provided

	that each such note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as
	practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.




	The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change
	of Control Offer following a Change of Control are applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit
	the holders of the notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.




	The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
	compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption
	has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption Redemption & Offer to Purchase, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.




	The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other
	disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of (a) Parent, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (b) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there
	is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its
	notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of (a) Parent, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (b) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken
	as a whole, in either case, to another Person or group may be uncertain.




	The Change of Control provisions of the notes may in
	certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer or Parent and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer and/or Parent could, in the future, enter into
	certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect
	the Issuers or Parents capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the Issuers and Parents ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
	Stock and Restricted Payments covenants. Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in
	such covenants, however, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.




	 




	73








	Table of Contents




	Future agreements governing Indebtedness of Parent, the Issuer or their respective
	Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control or an Asset Sale and including repurchases or other prepayments in respect of the notes. The exercise by the holders of notes of
	their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control or Asset Sale or upon a Mandatory Redemption Upon Event of Loss of a Vessel could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control or Asset
	Sale or event giving rise to the Mandatory Redemption Upon Event of Loss of a Vessel itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases or redemption on Parent, the Issuer or their respective Subsidiaries. In the event a Change of
	Control, Asset Sale or event giving rise to the Mandatory Redemption Upon Event of Loss of a Vessel occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing or redeeming notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its other applicable debt
	holders or lenders to purchase the notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing notes. In that
	case, the Issuers failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under other Indebtedness of the Issuer. Finally, the Issuers ability to pay cash to
	the holders of notes upon a repurchase or redemption may be limited by the Issuers then existing financial resources. See 

	Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and the NotesThe Issuer may not be able to repurchase
	the notes with cash upon a change of control or in connection with an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of an asset sale as required by the indenture.

	Asset Sales





	The Issuer will not, and neither Parent nor the Issuer will
	permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate the sale, lease (except under an (i) Internal Charter, (ii) a Drilling Contract or (iii) a Permitted Third Party Charter), conveyance or other
	disposition of any Deepwater Vessel or any right to a Deepwater Vessel or a construction contract respecting the construction of a Deepwater Vessel. In addition, the Issuer will not, and neither Parent nor the Issuer will permit any of the
	Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate any other Asset Sale unless:



	 





	 




	(1)




	the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets
	or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and





	 





	 




	(2)




	at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash;

	provided, however

	, to the extent
	that any disposition in such Asset Sale was of Collateral, the non-cash consideration received is pledged as Collateral under the Collateral Agreements contemporaneously with such sale, in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture.






	For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:



	 





	 




	(a)




	any liabilities, as shown on the Issuers most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and
	liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the notes or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets so long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary are released from further liability;





	 





	 




	(b)




	any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such
	Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of the receipt thereof, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion; and





	 





	 




	(c)




	any stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (2) or (4) of the next paragraph of this covenant. Any Asset Sale pursuant to an Involuntary Transfer
	shall not be required to satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant.






	 




	74








	Table of Contents




	Within 360 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (including, without
	limitation, an Involuntary Transfer, but excluding an Asset Sale involving a Vessel that is permitted under the Indenture, which is subject to the provisions of the next succeeding paragraph), the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as
	the case may be, may apply such Net Proceeds:



	 





	 




	(1)




	to repay Indebtedness, including notes and permanent reductions of Obligations under any Credit Facility (and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit
	Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto);





	 





	 




	(2)




	to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted Business of the Issuer, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition
	of Capital Stock, such Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;





	 





	 




	(3)




	to make a capital expenditure for the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; or





	 





	 




	(4)




	to acquire other assets that are not classified as current assets under GAAP and that are used or useful in the Issuers Permitted Business.






	Within 180 days of any sale, lease (except under an Internal Charter, Drilling Contract or Permitted Third
	Party Charter), conveyance or other disposition of any Vessel or any right to a Vessel or a construction contract respecting the construction of a Vessel (in each case other than a Deepwater Vessel or that is otherwise not prohibited under the
	Indenture), the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, must reinvest such Net Proceeds in a Vessel.




	Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce outstanding revolving credit Indebtedness of Parent, the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Other Guarantor, or
	otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in cash and Cash Equivalents.




	Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or
	invested as provided in the third paragraph of this covenant will constitute 

	Excess Proceeds.

	 When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $20.0 million, the Issuer will, within ten (10) business days thereof,
	make an offer (the 

	Asset Sale Offer

	) to all holders of notes and all holders of other Pari Passu Obligations containing provisions similar to those set forth in the Indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the
	proceeds of sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes and such other Pari Passu Obligations that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal
	amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited
	by the Indenture and the Collateral Agreements;

	provided

	that pending any such application, the proceeds of the Asset Sale, whether assets, property or cash, are subject to a Lien under the Collateral Agreements. If the aggregate principal
	amount of notes and other Pari Passu Obligations tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee will select the notes and the Issuer shall select such other Pari Passu Obligations to be purchased on a

	pro
	rata

	basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.




	The Issuer
	will not, and neither Parent nor the Issuer will permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or suffer to exist any agreement that would place any restriction of any kind (other than pursuant to law or regulation) on the ability of the Issuer to
	make an Asset Sale Offer.




	The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
	securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations
	conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue
	of such compliance.

	Selection and Notice





	If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select notes for redemption on a

	pro rata

	basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee considers fair and
	appropriate, unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements.




	No notes of $2,000 or
	less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be sent (or transmitted otherwise in accordance with the procedure of DTC) at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of notes to be redeemed at its
	registered address, except that redemption notices may be sent more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. Notices of redemption
	may, at the Issuers option and discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an Equity Offering or Change of Control, as the case may be. If any such redemption or notice is subject to
	satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuers discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur
	and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.




	If any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note will state the portion of the principal amount of that note that is to be redeemed. A note in principal
	amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued in the name of the holder of notes upon cancellation of the original note (and in the case of global notes, in accordance with the procedures of DTC). Notes called for
	redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on notes or portions of notes called for redemption.





	Certain Covenants





	Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that
	are contained in the Indenture. If on any date following the Issue Date, (i) the notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies, and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture then, beginning on that
	day (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a 

	Covenant Suspension Event

	), the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this
	Description of Notes section of this prospectus will be suspended (collectively, the 

	If and while Parent, the Issuer, the Restricted Subsidiaries and the Other Guarantors are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In
	the event that Parent, the Issuer, the Restricted Subsidiaries and the Other Guarantors are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the
	

	Reversion Date

	) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then Parent, the Issuer, the Restricted Subsidiaries and the
	Other Guarantors will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to events from any such Reversion Date until the maturity of the notes unless there is a

	subsequent Suspension Period. The period of time between any Covenant Suspension Event and any Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the 

	Suspension Period

	.




	On any Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued, during the Suspension
	Period will be classified as having been incurred or issued pursuant to the first paragraph of Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock below or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of
	Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock below (to the extent such Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock would be permitted to be incurred or issued thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after
	giving effect to Indebtedness incurred or issued prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date);

	provided

	that to the extent such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock would not be so permitted to be
	incurred or issued pursuant to the first or second paragraph of Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock, such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock will be deemed to have been outstanding on the
	Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (3) of the second paragraph under Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to
	be made as Restricted Payments under Restricted Payments will be made as though the covenant described under Restricted Payments had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension
	Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of Restricted Payments. As described above, however, no
	Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by Parent, the Issuer, the Restricted Subsidiaries and the Other Guarantors during the Suspension Period. Within 30 days of such
	Reversion Date, the Issuer must comply with the terms of the covenant described under Certain CovenantsAdditional Note Guarantees.




	Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, the failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (including any action taken or omitted to be taken with
	respect thereto) or after the Suspension Period based solely on events that occurred during the Suspension Period will not give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture. In addition, the Indenture also permits, without causing a
	Default or Event of Default, Parent, Issuer, Restricted Subsidiaries and Other Guarantors to honor any contractual commitments entered into during a Suspension Period following a Reversion Date;

	provided

	that such contractual commitments were
	entered into during the Suspension Period and not in contemplation of a reversion of the Suspended Covenants.




	For purposes of
	the Asset Sales covenant, on the Reversion Date, any unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero.




	There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Ratings.





	Restricted Payments





	The
	Issuer will not, and neither Parent nor the Issuer will permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

	Restricted Subsidiaries or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer and other

	(1)




	no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted Payment;





	 





	 




	(2)




	the Issuer would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving

	pro forma

	effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made on the first day
	of the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the applicable ratio of Indebtedness to Consolidated Cash Flow test set forth in clause (b) of the first paragraph of the
	Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant; and

	such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries since the date of the
	Indenture (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2), (3), (4), (9) and (10) of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:





	 





	 




	(a)

	accounting period) from the first day of the first fiscal quarter commencing after the Issue Date to the end of the Issuers most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted
	Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit);

	such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the Issuer);

	plus






	 





	 




	(c)




	to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the date of the Indenture is sold for cash or otherwise liquidated or repaid for cash, the lesser of

	plus






	 





	 




	(d)




	to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary designated as such after the date of the Indenture is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary after the date of the
	Indenture, the lesser of (i) the Fair Market Value of Parents or the Issuers Investment in such Subsidiary, as the case may be, as of the date of such redesignation or (ii) such Fair Market Value as of the date on which such
	Subsidiary was originally designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary after the date of the Indenture;

	plus






	 





	 




	(e)




	50% of any dividends received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary after the date of the Indenture from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent that such
	dividends were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for such period.

	(2)




	the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds of the sale (other than to a Subsidiary of the Issuer) of, Equity Interests of the

	(3)




	the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is contractually

	resolution with respect thereto will be delivered to the Trustee. Such Board of Directors determination must be based upon an opinion or appraisal issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing if the Fair

	Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock

	provided, however,

	that:



	 





	 




	(a)




	Parent or any Other Guarantor may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock and any Other Guarantor may issue shares of preferred stock,

	such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been at least 2.0 to 1; or





	 





	 




	(b)




	the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock or other shares of preferred stock, if the ratio of
	total Indebtedness to Consolidated Cash Flow for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding
	the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or other shares of preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been less than 2.5 to 1,






	in each case determined on a

	pro forma

	basis (including a

	pro forma

	application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional
	Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or other shares of preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, on the first day of such four-quarter period.

	None of Parent, the Issuer, any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or any Other Guarantor will incur any
	Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of Parent, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary or Other Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually
	subordinated in right of payment to the notes and the applicable Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms;

	provided, however

	, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other
	Indebtedness solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior Lien basis.




	For purposes of
	determining compliance with this Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock meets the criteria of more than one of the
	categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (13) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, Parent, the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted to
	divide and classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later re-divide or re-classify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock in any manner that complies with this covenant. The
	accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of preferred
	stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock in the form of shares of the same class of preferred stock, Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of
	Disqualified Stock will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock for purposes of this covenant;

	provided

	, in each such case, that the amount of any such accrual, accretion or
	payment is included in Consolidated Interest Expense of the Issuer as accrued. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that Parent, the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary or Other
	Guarantor may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.




	The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:



	 





	 




	(1)




	the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount;





	 





	 




	(2)




	the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and





	 





	 




	(3)




	in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of:





	 





	 




	(a)




	the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

	Merger, Consolidation; Sale of Assets





	None of Parent, the Issuer or any other Guarantor will, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not Parent, the Issuer or such other Guarantor, as
	applicable, is the surviving Person); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of, with respect to Parent, the Issuer, the Restricted Subsidiaries and the Other

	(1)




	either: (a) Parent, the Issuer or such other Guarantor, as applicable, is the surviving Person; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
	consolidation or merger (if other than Parent, the Issuer or such other Guarantor, as the case may be) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made is a Person organized or existing under the laws of the
	Cayman Islands, the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia or, in the case of Parent, any other similar jurisdiction so long as neither the laws of any such jurisdiction nor any such transaction would adversely
	affect the holders of the notes;





	 





	 




	(2)




	the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Parent, the Issuer or such other Guarantor, as applicable) or the Person to which such
	sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made assumes all the obligations of Parent, the Issuer or such other Guarantor, as applicable, under the notes, Note Guarantees and the other Obligations under the Indenture, the
	Registration Rights Agreement and the Collateral Agreements, as applicable, pursuant to a supplemental indenture or an amendment thereto, as applicable, in each case reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Noteholder Collateral Agent, as

	In
	addition, neither Parent nor the Issuer will, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of the properties and assets of any of them or the Restricted Subsidiaries or Other Guarantors, taken as a whole, in one or more related
	transactions to any other Person.




	This Merger, Consolidation; Sale of Assets covenant will not apply to any
	consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary. Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant will not
	apply to a merger of the Issuer with an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction. Clause (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant will not apply to any Guarantor, other than Parent.





	Transactions with Affiliates





	Neither Parent nor the Issuer will, and neither of them will permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or any Other Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or

	Affiliate of Parent, the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Other Guarantor (each, an 

	Affiliate Transaction

	) unless:



	 





	 




	(1)




	the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to Parent, the Issuer, any applicable Restricted Subsidiary or any applicable Other Guarantor than
	those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Parent, the Issuer, any applicable Restricted Subsidiary or any applicable Other Guarantor with an unrelated Person or, if there is no such comparable transaction, on terms that are
	fair and reasonable to Parent, the Issuer, any applicable Restricted Subsidiary and any applicable Other Guarantor and reflect an arms length negotiation; and





	 





	 




	(2)




	Parent delivers to the Trustee:





	 





	 




	(a)




	with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $10.0 million, a resolution of the
	Board of Directors of Parent set forth in an officers certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the
	Board of Directors of Parent; and





	 





	 




	(b)




	with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of $100.0 million, an opinion as to
	the fairness to Parent, the Issuer, any applicable Restricted Subsidiary or any applicable Other Guarantor of such Affiliate Transaction from a financial point of view issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national
	standing.






	The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be
	subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:



	 





	 




	(1)




	any employment agreement, employee benefit plan, officer or director indemnification agreement or any similar arrangement entered into by Parent or any of its
	Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and payments pursuant thereto;

	(9)




	transactions between or among any Excluded Parent Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Parent and any of its other Subsidiaries (excluding transactions involving the
	Issuer, any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or any Other Guarantor), on the other hand,

	provided

	that such transaction is entered into in the ordinary course of business and on an arms length basis and that any such transaction has been
	approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of Parent pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors of Parent set forth in an officers certificate.







	Business Activities





	Neither Parent nor the Issuer will, and neither of them will permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or any Other Guarantor to, engage
	in any business other than Permitted Businesses, except to such extent as would not be material to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.





	Additional Note Guarantees





	If (a) the Issuer or any of the Restricted
	Subsidiaries acquire or create another Subsidiary, (b) Parent acquires or creates another Subsidiary to directly or indirectly own the Equity Interests of the Issuer, any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or any Other Guarantor, (c) any
	Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not already a Guarantor guarantees any Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility, any other Pari Passu Obligation or owns any Vessel, (d) any Subsidiary of Parent or the Issuer that is not already a Guarantor is
	the subject of a Contract Winning Trigger or (e) any Subsidiary of Parent or the Issuer that is not already a Guarantor becomes an Internal Charterer after the Issue Date, then Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, will (1) cause that
	Subsidiary to (a) execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to which it will become a Guarantor, (b) execute amendments to or otherwise accede to or join the Collateral Agreements and cause the same to be perfected pursuant to which it
	becomes subject to the obligations of a Guarantor thereunder and pledge its assets, including the Equity Interests it owns in any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to the Collateral Agreements and (c) execute an amendment to the Registration Rights
	Agreement to join that agreement in the same way and capacity as the other Guarantors and (2) deliver an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Trustee, in each case within 20 business days of the date on which the Subsidiary was acquired or
	created or otherwise becomes subject to this covenant;

	provided

	that any applicable Subsidiary may be released from its Note Guarantee and related pledge following the occurrence of a Contract Unwind Trigger

	provided

	the conditions to
	that release are satisfied. In addition, to the extent any such Subsidiary (x) is not already a direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Issuer and (y) does not constitute an Other Guarantor, Parent shall cause the Equity Interests of such
	Subsidiary to be transferred to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary within 20 business days of such Subsidiary executing a Note Guarantee or as soon as practicable where applicable local law requires additional time for compliance with applicable
	legal requirements.

	Vessel Transfers





	The Issuer and the Guarantors will be permitted to transfer legal title to a Vessel from one existing Guarantor to another existing Guarantor (or to an entity that simultaneously with such transfer
	becomes a Guarantor) subject to all of the existing security covering such Vessel remaining in place. The Issuer covenants in the Indenture as follows:



	 





	 




	(1)




	the Issuer will give the Pari Passu Collateral Agent written notice of any such proposed transfer not fewer than 30 days prior to the anticipated date of such transfer;





	 





	 




	(2)




	the bill of sale or other instrument of transfer will explicitly state that the transfer is subject to the assumption or continuance of the existing Ship Mortgage in
	full force and effect;





	 





	 




	(3)




	the relevant Vessel will be duly re-registered in the name of the transferee Guarantor under the laws and flag of the relevant jurisdiction simultaneously with such
	transfer and evidence thereof delivered to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent on such date;





	 





	 




	(4)




	if appropriate in the opinion of the legal counsel described in subclause (7) below, an instrument of assumption of mortgage will be executed by the transferee
	Guarantor and the Pari Passu Collateral Agent and registered promptly with such transfer with the appropriate authorities of the Vessels jurisdiction of registry, or any such other instrument required to perfect a Ship Mortgage in favor of the
	Pari Passu Collateral Agent as required by the Vessels jurisdiction of registry;





	 





	 




	(5)




	simultaneously with such transfer, the transferee Guarantor will acknowledge in writing to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent that the Ship Mortgage and all other
	Collateral relating to the Vessel remains in full force and effect and is ratified and confirmed by the transferee Guarantor;





	 





	 




	(6)




	on the same date of such transfer, the Issuer and the transferee Guarantor will deliver to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent a certificate of ownership and encumbrance or
	similar certificate issued by the jurisdiction of registration of the Vessel evidencing re-registration in the name of the transferee Guarantor and the continuance of the Ship Mortgage in favor of the Pari Passu Collateral Agent; and





	 





	 




	(7)




	the Issuer will cause to be delivered to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent on the same date of such transfer a legal opinion from outside counsel reasonably satisfactory
	to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent to the following effect (i) the Vessel is duly registered (preliminarily registered if the jurisdiction is Panama) in the name of the transferee Guarantor with the appropriate authorities of the Vessels
	jurisdiction of registry; (ii) the Ship Mortgage constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the transferee Guarantor and remains duly registered as a first priority Lien or ship mortgage in favor of the Pari Passu Collateral Agent
	with priority dating back to the date on which such Ship Mortgage was initially registered in favor of the Pari Passu Collateral Agent; (iv) an assumption of the Ship Mortgage by the transferee Guarantor has been duly registered (preliminarily
	registered if the jurisdiction is Panama) (or an opinion that such an assumption is not required to maintain the status of the mortgage or the assumption by the transferee Guarantor of all obligations of the mortgagor thereunder); (v) all
	Collateral relating to the Vessel constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the transferee Guarantor; (iv) all filings and consents in the relevant jurisdictions have been obtained or made; and (vi) such transfer is in compliance
	with the terms of the Indenture. Such legal opinion shall also contain such other opinions as are requested by the Pari Passu Collateral Agent and otherwise be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent. The
	counsel issuing such opinion may rely on local counsel admitted to practice in the jurisdiction of registration of the Vessel with respect to matters governed by the laws of such jurisdiction. If the vessel transferred is registered under the laws
	and flag of Panama, the Issuer will also covenant to deliver to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent an opinion of Panamanian counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Pari Passu Collateral Agent not later than five (5) months after the date of
	transfer confirming that such Vessel has been permanently registered in the name of the transferee Guarantor and that any assumption of Ship Mortgage or other instrument required to be filed has been permanently recorded.

	Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries




	 





	 




	(1)




	The Board of Directors of Parent may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if:





	 





	 




	(a)




	the Issuer could make the Restricted Payment which is deemed to occur upon such designation by the 

	Restricted Payments

	 covenant equal to the
	appropriate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by Parent, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in such Subsidiary at the time of such designation;





	 





	 




	(b)




	such Restricted Subsidiary meets the definition of an 

	Unrestricted Subsidiary

	;





	 





	 




	(c)




	the designation would not constitute or cause (with or without the passage of time) a Default or Event of Default or no Default or Event of Default would be in
	existence following such designation; and





	 





	 




	(d)




	the Issuer delivers to the Trustee a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of Parent giving effect to such designation and an officers
	certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the Restricted Payments covenant.






	If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by Parent, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the
	Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the Restricted Payments covenant or under
	one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer.




	If, at any time, any
	Unrestricted Subsidiary designated as such would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any other Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the definition of an 

	Unrestricted Subsidiary,

	 then such
	Subsidiary will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not
	permitted to be incurred as of such date under the Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant, the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary will be in default of such covenant.




	In connection with the occurrence of a Contract Unwind Trigger, Parent or the Issuer may cause an applicable Restricted Subsidiary to be
	designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary if it meets the conditions set forth in clause (1) of this covenant.



	 





	 




	(2)




	The Board of Directors of Parent may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary or Subsidiary of Parent to be a Restricted Subsidiary if:





	 





	 




	(a)




	the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries could incur the Indebtedness which is deemed to be incurred upon such designation under the Incurrence of Indebtedness
	and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant, equal to the total Indebtedness of such Subsidiary calculated on a

	pro forma

	basis as if such designation had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period;





	 





	 




	(b)




	the designation would not constitute or cause a Default or Event of Default; and





	 





	 




	(c)




	the Issuer delivers to the Trustee a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of Parent giving effect to such designation and an officers
	certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions, including the incurrence of Indebtedness under the covenant Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock covenant.






	Parent or the Issuer shall be required to designate each applicable Subsidiary to become a Restricted
	Subsidiary and a Guarantor and pledge its assets and property as Collateral pursuant to the Additional Note Guarantees covenant and shall be required to comply with the conditions set forth in this clause (2) in connection




	 




	88








	Table of Contents




	therewith within 20 business days or as soon as practicable where applicable local law requires additional time for compliance with applicable legal requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, no
	direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent may become a Restricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture if such Subsidiary is a Subsidiary of Parent but not the Issuer.





	Payments for Consent





	Neither Parent nor the Issuer will, and neither of
	them will permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, any Other Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of notes for or as an inducement
	to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all holders of the notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set
	forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.





	Reports





	Whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, so long as any notes are outstanding, Parent or the Issuer will furnish
	to the holders of notes or cause the Trustee to furnish to the holders of notes, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and regulations:



	 





	 




	(1)




	all quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K that would be required to be filed with the SEC on such forms if Parent or the Issuer were required
	to file such reports under the Exchange Act;





	 





	 




	(2)




	all current reports on Form 8-K that would be required to be filed with the SEC on such form if Parent or the Issuer were required to file such reports under the
	Exchange Act; and





	 





	 




	(3)




	in a footnote to Parents financial statements included in quarterly or annual reports to be filed or furnished pursuant to clauses (1) and (2) of this
	paragraph, the financial information required to comply with Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act.






	All such reports will be prepared in all material respects in accordance with all of the rules and regulations applicable to such reports. Each annual report on Form 10-K will include a report on the
	Issuers consolidated financial statements by Parents certified independent accountants. In addition, Parent will post the reports on its website within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations applicable to such reports
	and Parent will file a copy of each of the reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above with the SEC for public availability within those time periods (unless the SEC will not accept such a filing). Parent and the Issuer will be deemed
	to have furnished such reports referred to above to the Trustee and the holders of the notes if Parent has filed such reports with the SEC via the EDGAR filing system (or any successor system) and such reports are publicly available.




	If at any time the Issuer is no longer subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for any reason, Parent or the
	Issuer will nevertheless continue filing the reports specified in the preceding paragraphs of this covenant with the SEC within the time periods specified by the SEC for registrants that are non-accelerated filers unless the SEC will not accept such
	a filing. Neither Parent nor the Issuer will take any action for the purpose of causing the SEC not to accept any such filings. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the SEC will not accept Parents or the Issuers filings for any reason,
	Parent or the Issuer will post the reports referred to in the preceding paragraphs on its website within the time periods that would apply to non-accelerated filers if Parent or the Issuer were required to file those reports with the SEC.




	Parent agrees that, for so long as any notes remain outstanding, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to hold and
	participate in quarterly conference calls with holders of the notes and securities analysts relating to the financial condition and results of operations of Parent, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries.

	Subsidiaries. If the Board of Directors of Parent has designated any of the Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraphs will include a reasonably
	detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and also in the MD&A of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the

	In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors

	investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.




	Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee shall be for informational purposes only, and the Trustees

	Events of Default and Remedies





	Each of the following is an 

	Event of Default

	:

	(4)

	from the date of occurrence of the event giving rise to the obligations thereunder;





	 





	 




	(5)




	failure by Parent, the Issuer, any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or any Other Guarantor for 60 days after notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the holders of at
	least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding voting as a single class to comply with any of the other agreements in the Indenture (120 days with respect to the Reports covenant subject to the following
	paragraph);





	 





	 




	(6)





	default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for
	money borrowed by Parent, the Issuer, any of







	 




	90








	Table of Contents






	 




	the Restricted Subsidiaries or any Other Guarantor (or the payment of which is guaranteed by Parent, the Issuer, any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or any Other Guarantor), whether such
	Indebtedness now exists, or is created after the date of the Indenture, if that default:





	 





	 




	(a)




	is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such
	Indebtedness on the date of such default (a 

	Payment Default

	); or





	 





	 




	(b)




	results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity, and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
	principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $25.0 million or more;





	 





	 




	(7)




	failure by Parent, the Issuer, any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or any Other Guarantor to pay final judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction

	(8)




	breach by the Issuer or any Guarantor of any material representation or warranty or agreement in the Collateral Agreements, the repudiation by the Issuer or any
	Guarantor of any of its obligations under the Collateral Agreements or the unenforceability of the Collateral Agreements against the Issuer or any Guarantor for any reason;





	 





	 




	(9)




	except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force
	and effect, or any Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee; and





	 





	 




	(10)




	certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to Parent, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary,
	or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.






	Notwithstanding the above, if the Issuer elects, by giving written notice to the Trustee, the sole remedy for an Event of Default
	relating to the failure to comply with the Reports covenant, and/or for failure to comply with the requirements of Section 314(a)(1) of the TIA will, for the 60 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default, consist
	exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the notes at an annual rate equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the notes then outstanding over such portion of the 60-day period immediately following such Event of Default during
	which such Event of Default is continuing (such additional interest, 

	Default Interest

	). In the event the Issuer does not elect to pay the Default Interest, upon an Event of Default to this covenant, the notes will be subject to
	acceleration as provided above. Any Default Interest that accrues on all outstanding notes from and including the date on which an Event of Default relating to a failure to comply with the Reports covenant and/or for any failure to
	comply with the requirements of Section 314(a)(1) of the TIA first occurs to, but not including, the 60th day thereafter (or such earlier date on which the Event of Default relating to such failure shall have been cured or waived) and will be
	payable in the same manner as any Additional Interest. On such 60th day (or earlier, if the Event of Default relating to such failure is cured or waived prior to such 60th day) such additional interest will cease to accrue and the notes will be
	subject to acceleration, as provided above, if the Event of Default is continuing. This provision will not affect the rights of holders of notes in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default. For all purposes of the Indenture,
	references to interest means interest under the notes and any Default Interest payable pursuant to this paragraph.




	In the
	case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to Parent, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If
	any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately.

	Table of Contents




	Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
	then outstanding notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their
	interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or premium.




	Subject to the
	provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction
	of any holders of notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, when due, no
	holder of a note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the notes unless:



	 





	 




	(1)




	such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;





	 





	 




	(2)




	holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;





	 





	 




	(3)




	such holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense;





	 





	 




	(4)




	the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and





	 





	 




	(5)




	holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such
	60-day period.






	The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes by notice
	to the Trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of
	interest or premium on, or the principal of, the notes.




	The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement
	regarding compliance with the Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.





	No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders





	No present, past or future director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of Parent, the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Other Guarantor, as such, will have any liability for any
	obligations of Parent, the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Other Guarantor under the notes, the Indenture or the Note Guarantees, the Collateral Agreements or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
	creation. Each holder of notes by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal
	securities laws.





	Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance





	The Issuer may at any time, at the option of the Board of Directors of Parent evidenced by a resolution set forth in an officers certificate, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with
	respect to the outstanding notes and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees (

	Legal Defeasance

	) except for:



	 





	 




	(1)




	the rights of holders of outstanding notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or premium on, such notes when such payments are due from the
	trust referred to below;





	 





	 




	(2)




	the Issuers obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the
	maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;






	 




	92








	Table of Contents






	 




	(3)




	the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuers and the Guarantors obligations in connection therewith; and





	 





	 




	(4)




	the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.






	In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make
	Change of Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture (

	Covenant Defeasance

	) and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to
	the notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events) described under Events of Default and Remedies will no longer constitute
	an Event of Default with respect to the notes.




	In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:



	 





	 




	(1)




	the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities,
	or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable Government Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the
	principal of, or interest and premium on, the outstanding notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the notes are being defeased to such stated date for
	payment or to a particular redemption date;





	 





	 




	(2)




	in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Issuer
	has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based
	thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the
	same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;





	 





	 




	(3)




	in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the holders of the
	outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have
	been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;





	 





	 




	(4)




	no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of
	funds to be applied to such deposit) and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound;





	 





	 




	(5)




	such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other
	than the Indenture) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound;





	 





	 




	(6)




	the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officers certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of
	notes over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or others; and





	 





	 




	(7)




	the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officers certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal
	Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

	Satisfaction and Discharge





	The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all notes issued thereunder, when:



	 





	 




	(1)




	either:





	 





	 




	(a)




	all notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed notes that have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has been deposited in
	trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or





	 





	 




	(b)




	all notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the sending of a notice of redemption or otherwise or
	will become due and payable within one year and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable
	Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable Government Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the
	notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;





	 





	 




	(2)




	no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of the deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds
	to be applied to such deposit) and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound;





	 





	 




	(3)




	the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and





	 





	 




	(4)




	the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the notes at maturity or on the
	redemption date, as the case may be.






	In addition, the Issuer must deliver an officers certificate and an
	opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

	Supplement and Waiver





	Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the notes, the Note
	Guarantees and the Collateral Agreements may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in

	Concerning the Trustee





	If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the Indenture limits the right of the Trustee to obtain payment of
	claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions. However, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must
	eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue as Trustee (if the Indenture has been qualified under the TIA) or resign.




	The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy
	available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the same degree of care and skill in its
	exercise as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request
	of any holder of notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.





	Governing Law





	The Indenture provides that it, the notes, the Note
	Guarantees and certain of the Collateral Agreements, including the Security Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

	be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under Notice to Investors. Regulation S Notes will also bear the legend as described under Notice to Investors. In addition,
	transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream), which may change from time to
	time.





	Depository Procedures





	The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control
	of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Issuer takes no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urges investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.




	DTC has advised the Issuer that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating
	organizations (collectively, the 

	Participants

	) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The
	Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTCs system is also available to other entities such as banks,
	brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the 

	Indirect Participants

	). Persons who are not Participants may
	beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the
	records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.




	DTC has also advised the Issuer that, pursuant to procedures
	established by it:



	 





	 




	(1)




	upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the
	Global Notes; and





	 





	 




	(2)




	ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by
	DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interest in the Global Notes).






	All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements
	of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that
	they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on behalf of the Indirect Participants,
	the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical
	certificate evidencing such interests.




	Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes
	registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or 

	holders

	 thereof under the Indenture for any purpose.

	Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on a Global Note
	registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the notes, including
	the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any
	responsibility or liability for:



	 





	 




	(1)




	any aspect of DTCs records or any Participants or Indirect Participants records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership
	interest in the Global Notes) or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTCs records or any Participants or Indirect Participants records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or





	 





	 




	(2)




	any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants, or Indirect Participants.






	DTC has advised the Issuer that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including
	principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with
	an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be
	governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will
	be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from
	DTC or its nominee for all purposes.




	Transfers between the Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC s procedures,
	and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.




	Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the
	Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTCs rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective
	depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established
	deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its
	behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants
	may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.




	DTC has advised the Issuer that it
	will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
	amount of the notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form,
	and to distribute such notes to its Participants.




	None of the Issuer, the Trustee and any of their respective agents will
	have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

	Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes





	A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:



	 





	 




	(1)




	DTC (a) notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered
	under the Exchange Act and, in either case, the Issuer fails to appoint a successor depositary;





	 





	 




	(2)




	the Issuer, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the Certificated Notes; or





	 





	 




	(3)




	there has occurred and is continuing a Default or Event of Default with respect to the notes and DTC requests such exchange.






	In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior written notice given to the Trustee
	by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the Indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations,
	requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend unless that legend is not required by applicable law.





	Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes





	Certificated Notes may not
	be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer
	restrictions applicable to such notes.





	Same Day Settlement and Payment





	The Issuer will make payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and interest)
	by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its nominee. The Issuer will make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately
	available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holders registered address. The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be
	eligible to trade in DTCs Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Issuer expects that secondary
	trading in any Certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds.




	Because of time zone differences, the
	securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the
	securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised the Issuer that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of
	interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the
	business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTCs settlement date.





	Certain Definitions





	Set forth below are certain defined terms used in the Indenture. Reference is made to the Indenture for a full disclosure of all defined

	CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS





	The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to the exchange of the exchange notes for the old
	notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis for all potential tax effects. The summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury Regulations, Internal Revenue Service rulings and pronouncements and judicial
	decisions now in effect, all of which may be subject to change at any time by legislative, judicial or administrative action. These changes may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the exchange notes. The
	description does not consider the effect of any applicable foreign, state, local or other tax laws or estate or gift tax considerations.

	Each holder is encouraged to consult, and depend on, his own tax advisor in analyzing the particular tax
	consequences of exchanging such holders old notes for the exchange notes, including the applicability and effect of any federal, state, local and foreign tax laws

	.




	The exchange of the exchange notes for the old notes will not be a taxable event to a holder for United States federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, a holder will have the same adjusted issue price,
	adjusted basis and holding period in the exchange notes as it had in the old notes immediately before the exchange.










	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION





	Each broker-dealer that receives exchange notes for its own account pursuant to the exchange
	offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such exchange notes. This prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of
	exchange notes received in exchange for old notes where such old notes were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. We have agreed that, for 120 days after the consummation of the exchange offer, we will make
	this prospectus, as amended or supplemented, available upon request to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale.




	We will not receive any proceeds from any sale of exchange notes by broker-dealers. Exchange notes received by broker-dealers for their own account pursuant to the exchange offer may be sold from time to
	time in one or more transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing of options on the exchange notes or a combination of such methods of resale, at market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at
	prices related to such prevailing market prices or negotiated prices. Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such
	broker-dealer or the purchasers of any such exchange notes. Any broker-dealer that resells exchange notes that were received by it for its own account pursuant to the exchange offer and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of
	such exchange notes may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and any profit on any such resale of exchange notes and any commissions or concessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be
	underwriting compensation under the Securities Act. The enclosed letter of transmittal states that, by acknowledging that it will deliver and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an
	underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act.




	We have agreed to pay all expenses incident to the exchange
	offer (including the expenses of one counsel for the holders of the notes) other than commissions or concessions of any brokers or dealers and will indemnify the holders of the old notes (including any broker-dealers) against certain liabilities,
	including liabilities under the Securities Act.

	Item 20.






	Indemnification of Directors and Officers.







	Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a companys memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers
	and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud, willful default, willful neglect, dishonesty or the consequences
	of committing a crime. Our memorandum and articles of association provide for indemnification of our officers and directors for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud or willful default.




	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to
	the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is theretofore unenforceable.




	The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our memorandum and articles of association may discourage securityholders from bringing a
	lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise
	benefit us and our securityholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. There is currently
	no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought.

	Undertakings.







	(a) Each
	undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:




	1. To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being
	made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:




	(i) To include any prospectus required by
	section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;




	(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising
	after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum
	offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in
	the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement.




	(iii) To
	include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.




	2. That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment
	shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




	3. To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain
	unsold at the termination of the offering.




	4. That, for purposes of determining any liability under the
	Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrants annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report
	pursuant to section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such
	securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.




	 




	II-8








	Table of Contents




	(b) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may
	be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
	against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
	controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the
	opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the
	final adjudication of such issue.




	(c) Each undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to respond to requests for information
	that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus pursuant to Items 4, 10(b), 11, or 13 of this Form, within one business day of receipt of such request, and to send the incorporated documents by first class mail or other equally prompt means.
	This includes information contained in documents filed subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement through the date of responding to the request.




	(d) Each undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply by means of a post-effective amendment all information concerning a transaction, and the company being acquired involved therein, that was not
	the subject of and included in the registration statement when it became effective.

	Closing Register of Members or Fixing Record Date






	 





	5.1




	For the purpose of determining Members entitled to notice of, or to vote at any meeting of Members or any adjournment thereof, or Members entitled to receive payment of
	any Dividend or other distribution, or in order to make a determination of Members for any other purpose, the Directors may provide that the Register of Members shall be closed for transfers for a stated period which shall not in any case exceed
	forty days.





	 





	5.2




	In lieu of, or apart from, closing the Register of Members, the Directors may fix in advance or arrears a date as the record date for any such determination of Members
	entitled to notice of, or to vote at any meeting of the Members or any adjournment thereof, or for the purpose of determining the Members entitled to receive payment of any Dividend or other distribution, or in order to make a determination of
	Members for any other purpose.

	5.3




	If the Register of Members is not so closed and no record date is fixed for the determination of Members entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of Members or
	Members entitled to receive payment of a Dividend or other distribution, the date on which notice of the meeting is sent or the date on which the resolution of the Directors resolving to pay such Dividend or other distribution is passed, as the case
	may be, shall be the record date for such determination of Members. When a determination of Members entitled to vote at any meeting of Members has been made as provided in this Article, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

	Certificates for Shares






	 





	6.1




	A Member shall only be entitled to a share certificate if the Directors resolve that share certificates shall be issued. Share certificates representing Shares, if any,
	shall be in such form as the Directors may determine. Share certificates shall be signed by one or more Directors or other person authorised by the Directors. The Directors may authorise certificates to be issued with the authorised signature(s)
	affixed by mechanical process. All certificates for Shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified and shall specify the Shares to which they relate. All certificates surrendered to the Company for transfer shall be cancelled and
	subject to the Articles no new certificate shall be issued until the former certificate representing a like number of relevant Shares shall have been surrendered and cancelled.





	 





	6.2




	The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for Shares held jointly by more than one person and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder
	shall be a sufficient delivery to all of them.





	 





	6.3




	If a share certificate is defaced, worn out, lost or destroyed, it may be renewed on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and on the payment of such
	expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in investigating evidence, as the Directors may prescribe, and (in the case of defacement or wearing out) upon delivery of the old certificate.





	 





	6.4




	Every share certificate sent in accordance with the Articles will be sent at the risk of the Member or other person entitled to the certificate. The Company will not be
	responsible for any share certificate lost or delayed in the course of delivery.





	 






	7






	Transfer of Shares






	 





	7.1




	Subject to Article 3.1, Shares are transferable subject to the consent of the Directors who may, in their absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of
	Shares without giving any reason. If the Directors refuse to register a transfer they shall notify the transferee within two months of such refusal.





	 





	7.2




	The instrument of transfer of any Share shall be in writing and shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor (and if the Directors so require, signed by or on
	behalf of the transferee). The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of a Share until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register of Members.





	 





	7.3




	Notwithstanding anything contained in these Articles, the Directors shall not decline to register any transfer of shares where such transfer is executed pursuant to, or
	for the purpose of enforcing, any security which has been granted over such shares, and a certificate by the party to whom such security has been granted that the transfer was so executed shall be conclusive evidence of such fact.

	Redemption and Repurchase of Shares






	 





	8.1




	Subject to the provisions of the Statute the Company may issue Shares that are to be redeemed or are liable to be redeemed at the option of the Member or the Company.
	The redemption of such Shares shall be effected in such manner as the Company may, by Special Resolution, determine before the issue of the Shares.





	 





	8.2




	Subject to the provisions of the Statute, the Company may purchase its own Shares (including any redeemable Shares) provided that the Members shall have approved the
	manner of purchase by Ordinary Resolution.





	 





	8.3




	The Company may make a payment in respect of the redemption or purchase of its own Shares in any manner permitted by the Statute, including out of capital.





	 






	9






	Variation of Rights of Shares






	 





	9.1




	If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into different classes of Shares, all or any of the rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided
	by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may, whether or not the Company is being wound up, be varied without the consent of the holders of the issued Shares of that class where such variation is considered by the Directors not to have a
	material adverse effect upon such rights; otherwise, any such variation shall be made only with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of that class, or with the sanction of a resolution passed by a
	majority of not less than two thirds of the votes cast at a separate meeting of the holders of the Shares of that class. For the avoidance of doubt, the Directors reserve the right, notwithstanding that any such variation may not have a material
	adverse effect, to obtain consent from the holders of Shares of the relevant class. To any such meeting all the provisions of the Articles relating to general meetings shall apply

	mutatis mutandis

	, except that the necessary quorum shall be
	one person holding or representing by proxy at least one third of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll.





	 





	9.2




	For the purposes of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two or more or all the classes of Shares as forming one class of Shares if the Directors consider
	that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way by the proposals under consideration, but in any other case shall treat them as separate classes of Shares.





	 





	9.3




	The rights conferred upon the holders of the Shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of
	issue of the Shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith.





	 






	10






	Commission on Sale of Shares







	The Company may, in so far as the Statute permits, pay a commission to any person in consideration of his subscribing or agreeing to subscribe (whether absolutely or conditionally) or procuring or
	agreeing to procure subscriptions (whether absolutely or conditionally) for any Shares. Such commissions may be satisfied by the payment of cash and/or the issue of fully or partly paid-up Shares. The Company may also on any issue of Shares pay such
	brokerage as may be lawful.




	 




	5











	11






	Non Recognition of Trusts







	The Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way (even when notified) any equitable, contingent, future or partial
	interest in any Share, or (except only as is otherwise provided by the Articles or the Statute) any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the holder.



	 






	12






	Lien on Shares






	 





	12.1




	The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on all Shares (whether fully paid-up or not) registered in the name of a Member (whether solely or jointly with
	others) for all debts, liabilities or engagements to or with the Company (whether presently payable or not) by such Member or his estate, either alone or jointly with any other person, whether a Member or not, but the Directors may at any time
	declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Article. The registration of a transfer of any such Share shall operate as a waiver of the Companys lien thereon. The Companys lien on a Share shall also extend
	to any amount payable in respect of that Share.





	 





	12.2




	The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any Shares on which the Company has a lien, if a sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently
	payable, and is not paid within fourteen clear days after notice has been received or deemed to have been received by the holder of the Shares, or to the person entitled to it in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the holder, demanding
	payment and stating that if the notice is not complied with the Shares may be sold.





	 





	12.3




	To give effect to any such sale the Directors may authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer of the Shares sold to, or in accordance with the directions
	of, the purchaser. The purchaser or his nominee shall be registered as the holder of the Shares comprised in any such transfer, and he shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the Shares be affected
	by any irregularity or invalidity in the sale or the exercise of the Companys power of sale under the Articles.





	 





	12.4




	The net proceeds of such sale after payment of costs, shall be applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable
	and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for sums not presently payable as existed upon the Shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the Shares at the date of the sale.





	 





	12.5




	Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles, in the case of any share which is the subject of any security agreement approved by the Directors by, or pursuant
	to which, a security interest, mortgage, charge or other encumbrance has been granted in respect of such share, (i) the Company shall not have any lien on any such share for any monies (whether presently payable or not) payable at a fixed time
	or called in respect of any such share, (ii) subject always to their Directors duties under Cayman Islands law, the Directors of the Company may not refuse to declare, and if requested to do so by any holder or the secured party under any
	such security agreement, may declare any such share to be exempt from any lien provisions provided for in Articles 12.1 to 12.4 and (iii) the provisions of Articles 12.1 to 12.4 inclusive shall not apply to any such share.






	 




	6











	13






	Call on Shares






	 





	13.1




	Subject to the terms of the allotment and issue of any Shares, the Directors may make calls upon the Members in respect of any monies unpaid on their Shares (whether in
	respect of par value or premium), and each Member shall (subject to receiving at least fourteen clear days notice specifying the time or times of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times so specified the amount called on the Shares. A
	call may be revoked or postponed, in whole or in part, as the Directors may determine. A call may be required to be paid by instalments. A person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding the subsequent
	transfer of the Shares in respect of which the call was made.





	 





	13.2




	A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising such call was passed.





	 





	13.3




	The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.





	 





	13.4




	If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable, the person from whom it is due shall pay interest on the amount unpaid from the day it became due and
	payable until it is paid at such rate as the Directors may determine (and in addition all expenses that have been incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment), but the Directors may waive payment of the interest or expenses wholly or in
	part.





	 





	13.5




	An amount payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any fixed date, whether on account of the par value of the Share or premium or otherwise, shall be
	deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the provisions of the Articles shall apply as if that amount had become due and payable by virtue of a call.





	 





	13.6




	The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and times of payment of calls, or the interest to be paid.





	 





	13.7




	The Directors may, if they think fit, receive an amount from any Member willing to advance all or any part of the monies uncalled and unpaid upon any Shares held by
	him, and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable) pay interest at such rate as may be agreed upon between the Directors and the Member paying such amount in advance.





	 





	13.8




	No such amount paid in advance of calls shall entitle the Member paying such amount to any portion of a Dividend or other distribution payable in respect of any period
	prior to the date upon which such amount would, but for such payment, become payable.





	 






	14






	Forfeiture of Shares






	 





	14.1




	If a call or instalment of a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the Directors may give to the person from whom it is due not less than fourteen
	clear days notice requiring payment of the amount unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued and any expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-payment. The notice shall specify where payment is to be made and shall
	state that if the notice is not complied with the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.





	 





	14.2




	If the notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which it was given may, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a
	resolution of the Directors. Such forfeiture shall include all Dividends, other distributions or other monies payable in respect of the forfeited Share and not paid before the forfeiture.






	 




	7










	14.3




	A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit and at any time before a sale,
	re-allotment or disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Directors think fit. Where for the purposes of its disposal a forfeited Share is to be transferred to any person the Directors may authorise some person to execute an
	instrument of transfer of the Share in favour of that person.





	 





	14.4




	A person any of whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of them and shall surrender to the Company for cancellation the certificate for
	the Shares forfeited and shall remain liable to pay to the Company all monies which at the date of forfeiture were payable by him to the Company in respect of those Shares together with interest at such rate as the Directors may determine, but his
	liability shall cease if and when the Company shall have received payment in full of all monies due and payable by him in respect of those Shares.





	 





	14.5




	A certificate in writing under the hand of one Director or officer of the Company that a Share has been forfeited on a specified date shall be conclusive evidence of
	the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the Share. The certificate shall (subject to the execution of an instrument of transfer) constitute a good title to the Share and the person to whom the Share is sold or
	otherwise disposed of shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of
	the Share.





	 





	14.6




	The provisions of the Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes payable at a fixed
	time, whether on account of the par value of the Share or by way of premium as if it had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.





	 






	15






	Transmission of Shares






	 





	15.1




	If a Member dies the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder) or his legal personal representatives (where he was a sole holder), shall be the only persons
	recognised by the Company as having any title to his Shares. The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in respect of any Share, for which he was a joint or sole holder.





	 





	15.2




	Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution of a Member (or in any other way than by transfer) may,
	upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the Directors, elect, by a notice in writing sent by him to the Company, either to become the holder of such Share or to have some person nominated by him registered as the holder of such
	Share. If he elects to have another person registered as the holder of such Share he shall sign an instrument of transfer of that Share to that person. The Directors shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as
	they would have had in the case of a transfer of the Share by the relevant Member before his death or bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution, as the case may be.





	 





	15.3





	A person becoming entitled to a Share by reason of the death or bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution of a Member (or in any other case than by
	transfer) shall be entitled to the same Dividends, other distributions and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the holder of such Share. However, he shall not, before becoming a Member in respect of a Share, be entitled in
	respect of it to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to general







	 




	8










	 




	meetings of the Company and the Directors may at any time give notice requiring any such person to elect either to be registered himself or to have some person nominated by him be registered as
	the holder of the Share (but the Directors shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer of the Share by the relevant Member before his death or bankruptcy or
	liquidation or dissolution or any other case than by transfer, as the case may be). If the notice is not complied with within ninety days of being received or deemed to be received (as determined pursuant to the Articles) the Directors may
	thereafter withhold payment of all Dividends, other distributions, bonuses or other monies payable in respect of the Share until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.





	 






	16






	Amendments of Memorandum and Articles of Association and Alteration of Capital






	 





	16.1




	The Company may by Ordinary Resolution:





	 





	 




	(a)




	increase its share capital by such sum as the Ordinary Resolution shall prescribe and with such rights, priorities and privileges annexed thereto, as the Company in
	general meeting may determine;





	 





	 




	(b)




	consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of larger amount than its existing Shares;





	 





	 




	(c)




	convert all or any of its paid-up Shares into stock, and reconvert that stock into paid-up Shares of any denomination;





	 





	 




	(d)




	by subdivision of its existing Shares or any of them divide the whole or any part of its share capital into Shares of smaller amount than is fixed by the Memorandum or
	into Shares without par value; and





	 





	 




	(e)




	cancel any Shares that at the date of the passing of the Ordinary Resolution have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and diminish the amount of its
	share capital by the amount of the Shares so cancelled.





	 





	16.2




	All new Shares created in accordance with the provisions of the preceding Article shall be subject to the same provisions of the Articles with reference to the payment
	of calls, liens, transfer, transmission, forfeiture and otherwise as the Shares in the original share capital.





	 





	16.3




	Subject to the provisions of the Statute and the provisions of the Articles as regards the matters to be dealt with by Ordinary Resolution, the Company may by Special
	Resolution:





	 





	 




	(a)




	change its name;





	 





	 




	(b)




	alter or add to the Articles;





	 





	 




	(c)




	alter or add to the Memorandum with respect to any objects, powers or other matters specified therein; and





	 





	 




	(d)




	reduce its share capital or any capital redemption reserve fund.






	 




	9











	17






	Offices and Places of Business







	Subject to the provisions of the Statute, the Company may by resolution of the Directors change the location of its Registered Office. The Company may, in addition to its Registered Office, maintain such
	other offices or places of business as the Directors determine.



	 






	18






	General Meetings






	 





	18.1




	All general meetings other than annual general meetings shall be called extraordinary general meetings.





	 





	18.2




	The Company may, but shall not (unless required by the Statute) be obliged to, in each year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting, and shall specify the
	meeting as such in the notices calling it. Any annual general meeting shall be held at such time and place as the Directors shall appoint and if no other time and place is prescribed by them, it shall be held at the Registered Office on the second
	Wednesday in December of each year at ten oclock in the morning. At these meetings the report of the Directors (if any) shall be presented.





	 





	18.3




	The Directors may call general meetings, and they shall on a Members requisition forthwith proceed to convene an extraordinary general meeting of the Company.





	 





	18.4




	A Members requisition is a requisition of Members holding at the date of deposit of the requisition not less than ten per cent. in par value of the issued Shares
	which as at that date carry the right to vote at general meetings of the Company.





	 





	18.5




	The Members requisition must state the objects of the meeting and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and may consist of
	several documents in like form each signed by one or more requisitionists.





	 





	18.6




	If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members requisition or if the Directors do not within twenty-one days from the date of the deposit
	of the Members requisition duly proceed to convene a general meeting to be held within a further twenty-one days, the requisitionists, or any of them representing more than one-half of the total voting rights of all of the requisitionists, may
	themselves convene a general meeting, but any meeting so convened shall be held no later than the day which falls three months after the expiration of the said twenty-one day period.





	 





	18.7




	A general meeting convened as aforesaid by requisitionists shall be convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general meetings are to be
	convened by Directors.





	 






	19






	Notice of General Meetings






	 





	19.1




	At least five clear days notice shall be given of any general meeting. Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the hour of the meeting and the general
	nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting and shall be given in the manner hereinafter mentioned or in such other manner if any as may be prescribed by the Company, provided that a general meeting of the Company shall, whether or
	not the notice specified in this Article has been given and whether or not the provisions of the Articles regarding general meetings have been complied with, be deemed to have been duly convened if it is so agreed:






	 




	10










	 




	(a)




	in the case of an annual general meeting, by all of the Members entitled to attend and vote thereat; and





	 





	 




	(b)




	in the case of an extraordinary general meeting, by a majority in number of the Members having a right to attend and vote at the meeting, together holding not less than
	ninety five per cent. in par value of the Shares giving that right.





	 





	19.2




	The accidental omission to give notice of a general meeting to, or the non receipt of notice of a general meeting by, any person entitled to receive such notice shall
	not invalidate the proceedings of that general meeting.





	 






	20






	Proceedings at General Meetings






	 





	20.1




	No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present. Two Members being individuals present in person or by proxy or if a corporation or
	other non-natural person by its duly authorised representative or proxy shall be a quorum unless the Company has only one Member entitled to vote at such general meeting in which case the quorum shall be that one Member present in person or by proxy
	or (in the case of a corporation or other non-natural person) by its duly authorised representative or proxy.





	 





	20.2




	A person may participate at a general meeting by conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all the persons participating in the meeting
	can communicate with each other. Participation by a person in a general meeting in this manner is treated as presence in person at that meeting.





	 





	20.3




	A resolution (including a Special Resolution) in writing (in one or more counterparts) signed by or on behalf of all of the Members for the time being entitled to
	receive notice of and to attend and vote at general meetings (or, being corporations or other non-natural persons, signed by their duly authorised representatives) shall be as valid and effective as if the resolution had been passed at a general
	meeting of the Company duly convened and held.





	 





	20.4




	If a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting to commence or if during such a meeting a quorum ceases to be present, the
	meeting, if convened upon a Members requisition, shall be dissolved and in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week at the same time and/or place or to such other day, time and/or place as the Directors may
	determine, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting to commence, the Members present shall be a quorum.





	 





	20.5




	The Directors may, at any time prior to the time appointed for the meeting to commence, appoint any person to act as chairman of a general meeting of the Company or, if
	the Directors do not make any such appointment, the chairman, if any, of the board of Directors shall preside as chairman at such general meeting. If there is no such chairman, or if he shall not be present within fifteen minutes after the time
	appointed for the meeting to commence, or is unwilling to act, the Directors present shall elect one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.





	 





	20.6




	If no Director is willing to act as chairman or if no Director is present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for the meeting to commence, the Members
	present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.






	 




	11










	20.7




	The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from time to time and from
	place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.





	 





	20.8




	When a general meeting is adjourned for thirty days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. Otherwise it shall
	not be necessary to give any such notice of an adjourned meeting.





	 





	20.9




	A resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands unless before, or on the declaration of the result of, the show of hands, the chairman
	demands a poll, or any other Member or Members collectively present in person or by proxy (or in the case of a corporation or other non-natural person, by its duly authorised representative or proxy) and holding at least ten per cent. in par value
	of the Shares giving a right to attend and vote at the meeting demand a poll.





	 





	20.10




	Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has been carried or carried unanimously, or by a
	particular majority, or lost or not carried by a particular majority, an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting shall be conclusive evidence of that fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded
	in favour of or against such resolution.





	 





	20.11




	The demand for a poll may be withdrawn.





	 





	20.12




	Except on a poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment, a poll shall be taken as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall
	be deemed to be the resolution of the general meeting at which the poll was demanded.





	 





	20.13




	A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken at such
	date, time and place as the chairman of the general meeting directs, and any business other than that upon which a poll has been demanded or is contingent thereon may proceed pending the taking of the poll.





	 





	20.14




	In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman shall be entitled to a second or casting vote.





	 






	21






	Votes of Members






	 





	21.1




	Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any Shares, on a show of hands every Member who (being an individual) is present in person or by proxy or, if a
	corporation or other non-natural person is present by its duly authorised representative or by proxy, shall have one vote and on a poll every Member present in any such manner shall have one vote for every Share of which he is the holder.





	 





	21.2




	In the case of joint holders the vote of the senior holder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy (or, in the case of a corporation or other non-natural
	person, by its duly authorised representative or proxy), shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names of the holders stand in the Register of Members.






	 




	12










	21.3




	A Member of unsound mind, or in respect of whom an order has been made by any court, having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll,
	by his committee, receiver, curator bonis, or other person on such Members behalf appointed by that court, and any such committee, receiver, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy.





	 





	21.4




	No person shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting unless he is registered as a Member on the record date for such meeting nor unless all calls or other monies
	then payable by him in respect of Shares have been paid.





	 





	21.5




	No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter except at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected to is given or
	tendered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be valid. Any objection made in due time in accordance with this Article shall be referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive.





	 





	21.6




	On a poll or on a show of hands votes may be cast either personally or by proxy (or in the case of a corporation or other non-natural person by its duly authorised
	representative or proxy). A Member may appoint more than one proxy or the same proxy under one or more instruments to attend and vote at a meeting. Where a Member appoints more than one proxy the instrument of proxy shall state which proxy is
	entitled to vote on a show of hands and shall specify the number of Shares in respect of which each proxy is entitled to exercise the related votes.





	 





	21.7




	On a poll, a Member holding more than one Share need not cast the votes in respect of his Shares in the same way on any resolution and therefore may vote a Share or
	some or all such Shares either for or against a resolution and/or abstain from voting a Share or some or all of the Shares and, subject to the terms of the instrument appointing him, a proxy appointed under one or more instruments may vote a Share
	or some or all of the Shares in respect of which he is appointed either for or against a resolution and/or abstain from voting a Share or some or all of the Shares in respect of which he is appointed.





	 






	22






	Proxies






	 





	22.1




	The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing and shall be executed under the hand of the appointor or of his attorney duly authorised in writing, or, if the
	appointor is a corporation or other non natural person, under the hand of its duly authorised representative. A proxy need not be a Member.





	 





	22.2




	The Directors may, in the notice convening any meeting or adjourned meeting, or in an instrument of proxy sent out by the Company, specify the manner by which the
	instrument appointing a proxy shall be deposited and the place and the time (being not later than the time appointed for the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting to which the proxy relates) at which the instrument appointing a proxy
	shall be deposited. In the absence of any such direction from the Directors in the notice convening any meeting or adjourned meeting or in an instrument of proxy sent out by the Company, the instrument appointing a proxy shall be deposited
	physically at the Registered Office not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the meeting or adjourned meeting to commence at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote.






	The chairman may in any event at his discretion declare that an instrument of proxy shall be deemed to have been duly deposited. An
	instrument of proxy that is not deposited in the manner permitted, or which has not been declared to have been duly deposited by the chairman, shall be invalid.




	 




	13










	22.3




	The instrument appointing a proxy may be in any usual or common form (or such other form as the Directors may approve) and may be expressed to be for a particular
	meeting or any adjournment thereof or generally until revoked. An instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to include the power to demand or join or concur in demanding a poll.





	 





	22.4




	Votes given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or insanity of the principal or revocation of the
	proxy or of the authority under which the proxy was executed, or the transfer of the Share in respect of which the proxy is given unless notice in writing of such death, insanity, revocation or transfer was received by the Company at the Registered
	Office before the commencement of the general meeting, or adjourned meeting at which it is sought to use the proxy.





	 






	23






	Corporate Members







	Any
	corporation or other non-natural person which is a Member may in accordance with its constitutional documents, or in the absence of such provision by resolution of its directors or other governing body, authorise such person as it thinks fit to act
	as its representative at any meeting of the Company or of any class of Members, and the person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation which he represents as the corporation could exercise if it were
	an individual Member.



	 






	24






	Shares that May Not be Voted







	Shares in the Company that are beneficially owned by the Company shall not be voted, directly or indirectly, at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding Shares
	at any given time.



	 






	25






	Directors







	There shall be
	a board of Directors consisting of not less than one person (exclusive of alternate Directors) provided however that the Company may by Ordinary Resolution increase or reduce the limits in the number of Directors. The first Directors of the Company
	shall be determined in writing by, or appointed by a resolution of, the Subscriber.



	 






	26






	Powers of Directors






	 





	26.1




	Subject to the provisions of the Statute, the Memorandum and the Articles and to any directions given by Special Resolution, the business of the Company shall be
	managed by the Directors who may exercise all the powers of the Company. No alteration of the Memorandum or Articles and no such direction shall invalidate any prior act of the Directors which would have been valid if that alteration had not been
	made or that direction had not been given. A duly convened meeting of Directors at which a quorum is present may exercise all powers exercisable by the Directors.





	 





	26.2




	All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other negotiable or transferable instruments and all receipts for monies paid to the Company shall be
	signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise executed as the case may be in such manner as the Directors shall determine by resolution.





	 





	26.3




	The Directors on behalf of the Company may pay a gratuity or pension or allowance on retirement to any Director who has held any other salaried office or place of
	profit with the Company or to his widow or dependants and may make contributions to any fund and pay premiums for the purchase or provision of any such gratuity, pension or allowance.






	 




	14










	26.4




	The Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and assets (present and future) and
	uncalled capital or any part thereof and to issue debentures, debenture stock, mortgages, bonds and other such securities whether outright or as security for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party.





	 






	27






	Appointment and Removal of Directors






	 





	27.1




	The Company may by Ordinary Resolution appoint any person to be a Director or may by Ordinary Resolution remove any Director.





	 





	27.2




	The Directors may appoint any person to be a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional Director provided that the appointment does not cause the number of
	Directors to exceed any number fixed by or in accordance with the Articles as the maximum number of Directors.





	 






	28






	Vacation of Office of Director







	The office of a Director shall be vacated if:



	 





	 




	(a)




	the Director gives notice in writing to the Company that he resigns the office of Director; or





	 





	 




	(b)




	the Director absents himself (for the avoidance of doubt, without being represented by proxy or an alternate Director appointed by him) from three consecutive meetings
	of the board of Directors without special leave of absence from the Directors, and the Directors pass a resolution that he has by reason of such absence vacated office; or





	 





	 




	(c)




	the Director dies, becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors generally; or





	 





	 




	(d)




	the Director is found to be or becomes of unsound mind; or





	 





	 




	(e)




	all of the other Directors (being not less than two in number) determine that he should be removed as a Director, either by a resolution passed by all of the other
	Directors at a meeting of the Directors duly convened and held in accordance with the Articles or by a resolution in writing signed by all of the other Directors.





	 






	29






	Proceedings of Directors






	 





	29.1




	The quorum for the transaction of the business of the Directors may be fixed by the Directors, and unless so fixed shall be two if there are two or more Directors, and
	shall be one if there is only one Director. A person who holds office as an alternate Director shall, if his appointor is not present, be counted in the quorum. A Director who also acts as an alternate Director shall, if his appointor is not
	present, count twice towards the quorum.





	 





	29.2




	Subject to the provisions of the Articles, the Directors may regulate their proceedings as they think fit. Questions arising at any meeting shall be decided by a
	majority of votes. In the case of an equality of votes, the chairman shall have a second or casting vote. A Director who is also an alternate Director shall be entitled in the absence of his appointor to a separate vote on behalf of his appointor in
	addition to his own vote.






	 




	15










	29.3




	A person may participate in a meeting of the Directors or committee of Directors by conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all the
	persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other at the same time. Participation by a person in a meeting in this manner is treated as presence in person at that meeting. Unless otherwise determined by the Directors the meeting
	shall be deemed to be held at the place where the chairman is located at the start of the meeting.





	 





	29.4




	A resolution in writing (in one or more counterparts) signed by all the Directors or all the members of a committee of the Directors or, in the case of a resolution in
	writing relating to the removal of any Director or the vacation of office by any Director, all of the Directors other than the Director who is the subject of such resolution (an alternate Director being entitled to sign such a resolution on behalf
	of his appointor and if such alternate Director is also a Director, being entitled to sign such resolution both on behalf of his appointer and in his capacity as a Director) shall be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of
	the Directors, or committee of Directors as the case may be, duly convened and held.





	 





	29.5




	A Director or alternate Director may, or other officer of the Company on the direction of a Director or alternate Director shall, call a meeting of the Directors by at
	least two days notice in writing to every Director and alternate Director which notice shall set forth the general nature of the business to be considered unless notice is waived by all the Directors (or their alternates) either at, before or
	after the meeting is held. To any such notice of a meeting of the Directors all the provisions of the Articles relating to the giving of notices by the Company to the Members shall apply

	mutatis mutandis.






	 





	29.6




	The continuing Directors (or a sole continuing Director, as the case may be) may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body, but if and so long as their number is
	reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to the Articles as the necessary quorum of Directors the continuing Directors or Director may act for the purpose of increasing the number of Directors to be equal to such fixed number, or of summoning a
	general meeting of the Company, but for no other purpose.





	 





	29.7




	The Directors may elect a chairman of their board and determine the period for which he is to hold office; but if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the
	chairman is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for the meeting to commence, the Directors present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.





	 





	29.8




	All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of the Directors (including any person acting as an alternate Director) shall, notwithstanding that it
	is afterwards discovered that there was some defect in the appointment of any Director or alternate Director, and/or that they or any of them were disqualified, and/or had vacated their office and/or were not entitled to vote, be as valid as if
	every such person had been duly appointed and/or not disqualified to be a Director or alternate Director and/or had not vacated their office and/or had been entitled to vote, as the case may be.





	 





	29.9




	A Director but not an alternate Director may be represented at any meetings of the board of Directors by a proxy appointed in writing by him. The proxy shall count
	towards the quorum and the vote of the proxy shall for all purposes be deemed to be that of the appointing Director.






	 




	16











	30






	Presumption of Assent







	A
	Director or alternate Director who is present at a meeting of the board of Directors at which action on any Company matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his dissent shall be entered in the minutes of the
	meeting or unless he shall file his written dissent from such action with the person acting as the chairman or secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered post to such person immediately after
	the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to dissent shall not apply to a Director or alternate Director who voted in favour of such action.



	 






	31






	Directors Interests






	 





	31.1




	A Director or alternate Director may hold any other office or place of profit under the Company (other than the office of Auditor) in conjunction with his office of

	31.2




	A Director or alternate Director may act by himself or by, through or on behalf of his firm in a professional capacity for the Company and he or his firm shall be

	31.3




	A Director or alternate Director may be or become a director or other officer of or otherwise interested in any company promoted by the Company or in which the Company

	interest in, such other company.





	 





	31.4




	No person shall be disqualified from the office of Director or alternate Director or prevented by such office from contracting with the Company, either as vendor,
	purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or any contract or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any Director or alternate Director shall be in any way interested be or be liable to be avoided, nor shall any
	Director or alternate Director so contracting or being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit realised by or arising in connection with any such contract or transaction by reason of such Director or alternate Director
	holding office or of the fiduciary relationship thereby established. A Director (or his alternate Director in his absence) shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any contract or transaction in which he is interested provided that the nature of
	the interest of any Director or alternate Director in any such contract or transaction shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any vote thereon.





	 





	31.5




	A general notice that a Director or alternate Director is a shareholder, director, officer or employee of any specified firm or company and is to be regarded as
	interested in any transaction with such firm or company shall be sufficient disclosure for the purposes of voting on a resolution in respect of a contract or transaction in which he has an interest, and after such general notice it shall not be
	necessary to give special notice relating to any particular transaction.





	 






	32






	Minutes







	The Directors
	shall cause minutes to be made in books kept for the purpose of all appointments of officers made by the Directors, all proceedings at meetings of the Company or the holders of any class of Shares and of the Directors, and of committees of the
	Directors, including the names of the Directors or alternate Directors present at each meeting.




	 




	17











	33






	Delegation of Directors Powers






	 





	33.1




	The Directors may delegate any of their powers, authorities and discretions, including the power to sub-delegate, to any committee consisting of one or more Directors.
	They may also delegate to any managing director or any Director holding any other executive office such of their powers, authorities and discretions as they consider desirable to be exercised by him provided that an alternate Director may not act as
	managing director and the appointment of a managing director shall be revoked forthwith if he ceases to be a Director. Any such delegation may be made subject to any conditions the Directors may impose and either collaterally with or to the
	exclusion of their own powers and any such delegation may be revoked or altered by the Directors. Subject to any such conditions, the proceedings of a committee of Directors shall be governed by the Articles regulating the proceedings of Directors,
	so far as they are capable of applying.





	 





	33.2




	The Directors may establish any committees, local boards or agencies or appoint any person to be a manager or agent for managing the affairs of the Company and may
	appoint any person to be a member of such committees, local boards or agencies. Any such appointment may be made subject to any conditions the Directors may impose, and either collaterally with or to the exclusion of their own powers and any such
	appointment may be revoked or altered by the Directors. Subject to any such conditions, the proceedings of any such committee, local board or agency shall be governed by the Articles regulating the proceedings of Directors, so far as they are
	capable of applying.





	 





	33.3




	The Directors may by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any person to be the agent of the Company on such conditions as the Directors may determine, provided that
	the delegation is not to the exclusion of their own powers and may be revoked by the Directors at any time.





	 





	33.4




	The Directors may by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company, firm, person or body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to
	be the attorney or authorised signatory of the Company for such purpose and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under the Articles) and for such period and subject to such
	conditions as they may think fit, and any such powers of attorney or other appointment may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorneys or authorised signatories as the Directors may think fit
	and may also authorise any such attorney or authorised signatory to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him.





	 





	33.5




	The Directors may appoint such officers of the Company (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, any secretary) as they consider necessary on such
	terms, at such remuneration and to perform such duties, and subject to such provisions as to disqualification and removal as the Directors may think fit. Unless otherwise specified in the terms of his appointment an officer of the Company may be
	removed by resolution of the Directors or Members. An officer of the Company may vacate his office at any time if he gives notice in writing to the Company that he resigns his office.

	34.4




	Any appointment or removal of an alternate Director shall be by notice to the Company signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in any other manner
	approved by the Directors.





	 





	34.5




	Subject to the provisions of the Articles, an alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for his own acts and
	defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him.





	 






	35






	No Minimum Shareholding







	The Company in general meeting may fix a minimum shareholding required to be held by a Director, but unless and until such a shareholding

	36






	Remuneration of Directors






	 





	36.1




	The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be such remuneration as the Directors shall determine. The Directors shall also be entitled to be paid all
	travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by them in connection with their attendance at meetings of Directors or committees of Directors, or general meetings of the Company, or separate meetings of the holders of any class of Shares or
	debentures of the Company, or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company or the discharge of their duties as a Director, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly
	of one such method and partly the other.





	 





	36.2




	The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any Director for any services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond his ordinary routine
	work as a Director. Any fees paid to a Director who is also counsel, attorney or solicitor to the Company, or otherwise serves it in a professional capacity shall be in addition to his remuneration as a Director.





	 






	37






	Seal






	 





	37.1




	The Company may, if the Directors so determine, have a Seal. The Seal shall only be used by the authority of the Directors or of a committee of the Directors authorised
	by the Directors. Every instrument to which the Seal has been affixed shall be signed by at least one person who shall be either a Director or some officer of the Company or other person appointed by the Directors for the purpose.





	 





	37.2




	The Company may have for use in any place or places outside the Cayman Islands a duplicate Seal or Seals each of which shall be a facsimile of the common Seal of the

	38






	Dividends, Distributions and Reserve






	 





	38.1




	Subject to the Statute and this Article and except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to any Shares, the Directors may resolve to pay Dividends and other
	distributions on Shares in issue and authorise payment of the Dividends or other distributions out of the funds of the Company lawfully available therefor. A Dividend shall be deemed to be an interim Dividend unless the terms of the resolution
	pursuant to which the Directors resolve to pay such Dividend specifically state that such Dividend shall be a final Dividend. No Dividend or other distribution shall be paid except out of the realised or unrealised profits of the Company, out of the
	share premium account or as otherwise permitted by the Statute.





	 





	38.2




	Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to any Shares, all Dividends and other distributions shall be paid according to the par value of the Shares that a
	Member holds. If any Share is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for Dividend as from a particular date, that Share shall rank for Dividend accordingly.





	 





	38.3




	The Directors may deduct from any Dividend or other distribution payable to any Member all sums of money (if any) then payable by him to the Company on account of calls
	or otherwise.





	 





	38.4




	The Directors may resolve that any Dividend or other distribution be paid wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and in particular (but without
	limitation) by the distribution of shares, debentures, or securities of any other company or in any one or more of such ways and where any difficulty arises in regard to such distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient
	and in particular may issue fractional Shares and may fix the value for distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the basis of the value so fixed in order to
	adjust the rights of all Members and may vest any such specific assets in trustees in such manner as may seem expedient to the Directors.





	 





	38.5




	Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to any Shares, Dividends and other distributions may be paid in any currency. The Directors may determine the basis
	of conversion for any currency conversions that may be required and how any costs involved are to be met.





	 





	38.6




	The Directors may, before resolving to pay any Dividend or other distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the
	discretion of the Directors, be applicable for any purpose of the Company and pending such application may, at the discretion of the Directors, be employed in the business of the Company.





	 





	38.7




	Any Dividend, other distribution, interest or other monies payable in cash in respect of Shares may be paid by wire transfer to the holder or by cheque or warrant sent
	through the post directed to the registered address of the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the registered address of the holder who is first named on the Register of Members or to such person and to such address as such holder or joint
	holders may in writing direct. Every such cheque or warrant shall be made payable to the order of the person to whom it is sent. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for any Dividends, other distributions, bonuses, or
	other monies payable in respect of the Share held by them as joint holders.






	 




	20










	38.8




	No Dividend or other distribution shall bear interest against the Company.





	 





	38.9




	Any Dividend or other distribution which cannot be paid to a Member and/or which remains unclaimed after six months from the date on which such Dividend or other
	distribution becomes payable may, in the discretion of the Directors, be paid into a separate account in the Companys name, provided that the Company shall not be constituted as a trustee in respect of that account and the Dividend or other
	distribution shall remain as a debt due to the Member. Any Dividend or other distribution which remains unclaimed after a period of six years from the date on which such Dividend or other distribution becomes payable shall be forfeited and shall
	revert to the Company.





	 






	39






	Capitalisation







	The
	Directors may at any time capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Companys reserve accounts or funds (including the share premium account and capital redemption reserve fund) or any sum standing to the credit of the profit and
	loss account or otherwise available for distribution; appropriate such sum to Members in the proportions in which such sum would have been divisible amongst such Members had the same been a distribution of profits by way of Dividend or other
	distribution; and apply such sum on their behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. In such event the Directors shall do all acts and things
	required to give effect to such capitalisation, with full power given to the Directors to make such provisions as they think fit in the case of Shares becoming distributable in fractions (including provisions whereby the benefit of fractional
	entitlements accrue to the Company rather than to the Members concerned). The Directors may authorise any person to enter on behalf of all of the Members interested into an agreement with the Company providing for such capitalisation and matters
	incidental or relating thereto and any agreement made under such authority shall be effective and binding on all such Members and the Company.



	 






	40






	Books of Account






	 





	40.1




	The Directors shall cause proper books of account to be kept with respect to all sums of money received and expended by the Company and the matters in respect of which
	the receipt or expenditure takes place, all sales and purchases of goods by the Company and the assets and liabilities of the Company. Proper books of account shall not be deemed to be kept if there are not kept such books of account as are
	necessary to give a true and fair view of the state of the Companys affairs and to explain its transactions.





	 





	40.2




	The Directors shall determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions or regulations the accounts and books of the Company or
	any of them shall be open to the inspection of Members not being Directors and no Member (not being a Director) shall have any right of inspecting any account or book or document of the Company except as conferred by Statute or authorised by the
	Directors or by the Company in general meeting.





	 





	40.3




	The Directors may cause to be prepared and to be laid before the Company in general meeting profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, group accounts (if any) and such
	other reports and accounts as may be required by law.






	 




	21











	41






	Audit






	 





	41.1




	The Directors may appoint an Auditor of the Company who shall hold office on such terms as the Directors determine.

	42.2




	Where a notice is sent by courier, service of the notice shall be deemed to be effected by delivery of the notice to a courier company, and shall be deemed to have been

	42.3




	A notice may be given by the Company to the person or persons which the Company has been advised are entitled to a Share or Shares in consequence of the death or

	22










	 




	holder first named in the Register of Members and every person upon whom the ownership of a Share devolves by reason of his being a legal personal representative or a trustee in bankruptcy of a

	43






	Winding Up






	 





	43.1




	If the Company shall be wound up the liquidator shall apply the assets of the Company in satisfaction of creditors claims in such manner and order as such
	liquidator thinks fit. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, in a winding up:





	 





	 




	(a)




	if the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the Companys issued share capital, such assets shall be
	distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be borne by the Members in proportion to the par value of the Shares held by them; or





	 





	 




	(b)




	if the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of the Companys issued share capital at the
	commencement of the winding up, the surplus shall be distributed amongst the Members in proportion to the par value of the Shares held by them at the commencement of the winding up subject to a deduction from those Shares in respect of which there
	are monies due, of all monies payable to the Company for unpaid calls or otherwise.





	 





	43.2




	If the Company shall be wound up the liquidator may, subject to the rights attaching to any Shares and with the sanction of a Special Resolution of the Company and any
	other sanction required by the Statute, divide amongst the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether such assets shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and may for that purpose value any assets and
	determine how the division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the Members
	as the liquidator, with the like sanction, shall think fit, but so that no Member shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is a liability.





	 






	44






	Indemnity and Insurance






	 





	44.1




	Every Director and officer of the Company (which for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include auditors of the Company), together with every former Director and former
	officer of the Company (each an 

	Indemnified Person

	) shall be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against any liability, action, proceeding, claim, demand, costs, damages or expenses, including legal expenses, whatsoever
	which they or any of them may incur as a result of any act or failure to act in carrying out their functions other than such liability (if any) that they may incur by reason of their own actual fraud or wilful default. No Indemnified Person shall be
	liable to the Company for any loss or damage incurred by the Company as a result (whether direct or indirect) of the carrying out of their functions unless that liability arises through the actual fraud or wilful default of such Indemnified Person.
	No person shall be found to have committed actual fraud or wilful default under this Article unless or until a court of competent jurisdiction shall have made a finding to that effect.






	 




	23










	44.2




	The Company shall advance to each Indemnified Person reasonable attorneys fees and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the defence of any action,
	suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnified Person for which indemnity will or could be sought. In connection with any advance of any expenses hereunder, the Indemnified Person shall execute an undertaking to repay the advanced
	amount to the Company if it shall be determined by final judgment or other final adjudication that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article. If it shall be determined by a final judgment or other final
	adjudication that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification with respect to such judgment, costs or expenses, then such party shall not be indemnified with respect to such judgment, costs or expenses and any advancement shall be
	returned to the Company (without interest) by the Indemnified Person.





	 





	44.3




	The Directors, on behalf of the Company, may purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of any Director or other officer of the Company against any liability
	which, by virtue of any rule of law, would otherwise attach to such person in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust of which such person may be guilty in relation to the Company.





	 






	45






	Financial Year







	Unless
	the Directors otherwise prescribe, the financial year of the Company shall end on 31st December in each year and, following the year of incorporation, shall begin on 1st January in each year.



	 






	46






	Transfer by Way of Continuation







	If the Company is exempted as defined in the Statute, it shall, subject to the provisions of the Statute and with the approval of a Special Resolution, have the power to register by way of continuation as
	a body corporate under the laws of any jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands and to be deregistered in the Cayman Islands.

	This Limited Liability Company Agreement (this 

	Agreement

	) of Vantage Delaware Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the 

	Company

	), is hereby adopted by
	Offshore Group Investment Limited, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (

	OGIL

	), the sole member of the Company, this 4th day of October, 2012, pursuant to and in accordance
	with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (6

	Del. C.

	§ 18-101,

	et seq

	.), as amended (the 

	DLLCA

	), to govern the affairs of the Company and the conduct of its business.






	A

	GREEMENT









	N

	OW

	, T

	HEREFORE

	, for and in consideration of the premises, the mutual covenants, rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement, and the benefits to be derived from them,
	OGIL agrees as follows:




	1.

	Formation

	. The Company was formed on October 4, 2012, when its Certificate of
	Formation (Certificate) was filed by an authorized person (within the meaning of the DLLCA) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to and in accordance with the DLLCA. The execution of the Certificate
	by such authorized person and the filing of the Certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware are hereby ratified, confirmed, and approved. Upon the filing of the Certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
	such authorized persons powers as an authorized person within the meaning of the DLLCA ceased.




	2.

	Name

	. The name of the Company is Vantage Delaware Holdings, LLC, and all Company business must be conducted in that name or such other names that comply with applicable law.




	3.

	Purpose

	. The purpose for which the Company is organized is to transact any and all lawful business for which limited liability
	companies may be organized under the DLLCA and which is not forbidden by the law of the jurisdiction in which the Company engages in that business.




	4.

	Registered Office and Registered Agent

	. The registered office of the Company required by the DLLCA to be maintained in the State of Delaware shall be the office of the registered agent named in
	the Certificate or such other office (which need not be a place of business of the Company) as the Board of Managers (as hereinafter defined) may designate in the manner provided by law. The registered agent of the Company in the State of Delaware
	shall be the registered agent named in the Certificate or such other person or persons as the Board of Managers may designate in the manner provided by law.




	5.

	Foreign Qualification

	. Prior to conducting business in any other jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware, the Company shall comply, to the extent procedures are available and those matters
	are reasonably within the control of the Company, with all requirements necessary to qualify the Company as a foreign limited liability company in that jurisdiction.








	6.

	Principal Office

	. The principal office of the Company (at which the books and
	records of the Company shall be maintained) shall be at such place as the Board of Managers may designate, which need not be in the State of Delaware. The Company may have such other offices as the Board of Managers may designate.




	7.

	Member

	. Contemporaneously with the formation of the Company, OGIL shall be admitted as the sole member of the Company, owning
	all 1,000 Common Shares of the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term Member means OGIL, in its capacity as a member of the Company, and any person or entity hereafter admitted to the Company as a member, but such term does not
	include any person or entity who has ceased to be a member of the Company. When used in the lower case and except as the context otherwise requires, the term member has the meaning provided in the DLLCA. A Member shall not cease to be a
	member of the Company upon the occurrence of any event described in Section 18-304 of the DLLCA.




	8.

	Common
	Shares

	. As used herein, the term Common Share shall mean an undivided fractional part of all of the limited liability company interests (as defined in the DLLCA) of the Company and shall include all rights, powers, and obligations
	possessed by the members of the Company under the DLLCA, the Certificate, and this Agreement. The Company is authorized to issue 1,000 Common Shares, all of which have been issued to the Member and shall be considered outstanding. Any person (as
	defined in the DLLCA) to whom a Common Share is transferred shall become and be admitted as a member of the Company with respect to such Common Share upon such transfer. A person shall cease to be a member of the Company when all of such
	persons Common Shares have been transferred to another person.




	9.

	Powers

	. The Company shall have the power and
	authority to take any and all actions necessary, appropriate, proper, advisable, convenient, or incidental to or for the furtherance of the purposes set forth in Section 3, including any and all powers set forth in the DLLCA.




	10.

	Term

	. The Companys existence shall be perpetual, unless it is dissolved sooner as a result of: (a) the written
	election of the Member, (b) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under Section 18-802 of the DLLCA, or (c) the occurrence of an event that causes there to be no members of the Company, unless the Company is continued in
	accordance with the DLLCA. No other event shall cause a dissolution of the Company.




	11.

	Management

	. Subject to the
	provisions of the DLLCA and any limitations in this Agreement as to action to be authorized or approved by the Member, all management powers over the business and affairs of the Company shall be exclusively vested in a board of managers (the
	Board of Managers or Board). Collectively, the Board of Managers shall constitute the managers of the Company within the meaning of the DLLCA. The Board of Managers may delegate certain of its powers to officers
	(the Officers), who shall be agents of the Company. The Member, by virtue of its status as a member of the Company, shall not have any management power over the business and affairs of the Company or actual or apparent authority to enter
	into contracts on behalf of, or to otherwise bind, the Company. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the authority and functions of the Board of Managers and of the Officers shall be identical to the authority and functions
	of the board of directors and officers, respectively, of a corporation organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law. Thus, except as otherwise




	 




	-2-








	specifically provided in this Agreement, the business and affairs of the Company shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Managers, and the day-to-day activities of the Company shall
	be conducted on the Companys behalf by the Officers. In addition to the powers that now or hereafter can be granted to managers under the DLLCA and to all other powers granted under any other provision of this Agreement, the Board of Managers
	(subject to Section 12 of this Agreement) and the Officers (subject to Section 14 of this Agreement and the direction of the Board of Managers) shall have full power and authority to do all things on such terms as they, in their sole
	discretion, may deem necessary or appropriate to conduct, or cause to be conducted, the business and affairs of the Company.




	12.

	Board of Managers

	.




	(a)

	Number, Qualifications and Term of Office.

	The number of members of the Board of Managers (each, a 

	Manager

	) that shall constitute the whole Board of Managers shall initially
	be equal to one. The number of Managers which shall constitute the whole Board shall be fixed from time to time as determined by resolution of the Board adopted by a majority of the whole Board, but shall consist of not less than one member. The
	number of Managers of the whole Board shall be set forth in the notice of any meeting of members, except as provided in

	Section 12(b)

	, and each Manager elected shall hold office until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify.
	Managers need not be residents of Delaware or members of the Company. The initial Manager shall be Paul A. Bragg.




	(b)

	Vacancies, Additional Managers, and Removal From Office

	. If any vacancy occurs in the Board caused by death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, or removal from office of any Manager, or
	otherwise, or if any new directorship is created by an increase in the authorized number of Managers, a majority of the Managers then in office, through less than a quorum, or a sole remaining Manager, may choose a successor or fill the newly
	created directorship; and a Manager so chosen shall hold office until the next election and until his successor shall be duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. Any Manager may be removed either for or without cause at any special
	meeting of Members duly called and held for such purpose.




	(c)

	Resignation

	. A Manager may resign at any
	time upon written notice of resignation to the Company. Any resignation shall be effective immediately unless a certain effective date is specified therein, in which event it will be effective upon such date and acceptance of any resignation shall
	not be necessary to make it effective.




	(d)

	Regular Meeting

	. A regular meeting of the Board of Managers
	is not required to be held each year. If a regular meeting is held, such regular meeting shall be held at such place and time as the Board of Managers may provide by resolution, within or without the State of Delaware, without other notice than such
	resolution.




	(e)

	Special Meeting

	. A special meeting of the Board of Managers may be called by the
	President of the Company and shall be called by the Secretary on the written request of any Manager. The President so calling, or the Manager so requesting, any such meeting shall fix the time and any place, either within or without the State of
	Delaware, as the place for holding such meeting.




	 




	-3-








	(f)

	Notice of Special Meeting

	. Written notice of special meetings of
	the Board of Managers shall be given to each Manager at least 48 hours prior to the time of such meeting. Any Manager may waive notice of any meeting. The attendance of a Manager at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting,
	except where a Manager attends a meeting for the purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any special meeting of the
	Board of Managers need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting, except that notice shall be given of any proposed amendment to this Agreement if it is to be adopted at any special meeting or with respect to any other matter
	where notice is required by this Agreement.




	(g)

	Quorum

	. A majority of the Board of Managers shall
	constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Managers, and the act of a majority of the Managers present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Managers, except as may be
	otherwise specifically provided by this Agreement. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Managers, the Managers present may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until
	a quorum shall be present.




	(h)

	Action Without Meeting

	. Unless otherwise restricted by this Agreement,
	any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Managers, may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board of Managers consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or
	electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes or proceedings of the Board of Managers. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained
	in electronic form. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy,
	facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.




	(i)

	Compensation

	. Managers, as such, shall not be entitled to any stated compensation for their services unless voted by the Member or the Board of Managers; but by resolution of the Board of Managers, a fixed sum and expenses of attendance, if
	any, may be allowed for attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board of Managers. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to preclude any Manager from serving the Company in any other capacity and receiving compensation
	therefor.




	13.

	Notice

	.




	(a)

	Methods of Giving Notice

	. Whenever, under this Agreement, notice is required to be given to any Manager or Member, such notice may be given in writing and delivered personally or mailed to such
	Manager or Member; provided that in the case of a Manager or Member such notice may be given orally or by telephone. If mailed, notice to a Manager or Member shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail first class in a
	sealed envelope, with postage thereon prepaid, addressed, in the case of a Member, to the Member at the Members address as it appears on the records of the Company or, in the case of a Manager, to such person at his business address. Notice to
	Managers and Members may also be given by facsimile telecommunication. Notice may also be given to any Manager or Member by a form of electronic transmission.




	 




	-4-








	(b)

	Written Waiver

	. Whenever any notice is required to be given under
	this Agreement, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent
	thereto.

	person so removed. Any Officer may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Company. Any such resignation shall take effect at the date of the receipt of such notice or at any later time specified therein, and unless otherwise specified
	therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

	(a)

	Third Party Actions

	. The Company shall indemnify any Manager or Officer, and may indemnify any other person,
	who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by
	reason of the fact that he is or was a Manager, Officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another limited liability company, corporation, partnership,
	joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding if he acted in
	good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of
	any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he
	reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.




	(b)

	Actions by or in the Right of the Company

	. The Company shall indemnify any Manager or Officer and may indemnify
	any other person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a
	Manager, Officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
	enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not
	opposed to the best interests of the Company and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that
	the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled
	to indemnity for such expenses as the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.




	(c)

	Mandatory Indemnification

	. To the extent that a Manager, Officer, employee, or agent of the Company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in

	Sections 18(a)

	and

	18(b)

	(d)

	Determination of Conduct

	. The determination that a Manager, Officer, employee, or agent has met the applicable
	standard of conduct set forth in

	Sections 18(a)

	and

	18(b)

	(unless indemnification is ordered by a court) shall be made (1) by the Board of




	 




	-8-








	Managers by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Managers who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding, or (2) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a
	quorum of disinterested Managers so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Member.




	(e)

	Payment of Expenses in Advance

	. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action,
	suit, or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Manager, Officer, employee, or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized in this

	Section 18

	.




	(f)

	Insurance

	. The Company may purchase and maintain (or reimburse a Member or
	its affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of any Manager, Officer, and such other persons as the Board of Managers shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expense that may be incurred by such person in
	connection with the Companys activities, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such liabilities under the provisions of this Agreement.




	(g)

	Indemnity Not Exclusive

	. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided or granted hereunder shall
	not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under the Certificate, any other provision of this Agreement, other agreement, vote of the Member, or disinterested
	Managers or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.

	existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its managers, directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a manager, director, officer, employee, or agent of such constituent entity, or is
	or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a manager, director, officer, employee, or agent of another limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position
	under this

	with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued;




	(ii) other enterprises shall include employee benefit plans;




	(iii) fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan;




	(iv) serving at the request of the Company shall include any service as a Manager, Officer,

	-9-








	(v) a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed

	Section 18

	.




	(i)

	Continuation of Indemnity

	. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided or granted hereunder shall,
	unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Manager, Officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a person.




	(j)

	Amendments

	. No amendment, modification, or repeal of this

	Section 18

	or any provision hereof shall
	in any manner terminate, reduce, or impair the right of any past, present, or future indemnitee to be indemnified by the Company, nor the obligation of the Company to indemnify any such indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of this

	Section 18

	as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification, or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification, or repeal, regardless
	of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

	Application

	. THE PROVISIONS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION
	PROVIDED IN THIS

	Section 18

	ARE INTENDED TO APPLY EVEN IF SUCH PROVISIONS HAVE THE EFFECT OF EXCULPATING THE INDEMNITEE FROM LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH PERSONS NEGLIGENCE, FAULT, OR OTHER CONDUCT.

	be disregarded as an entity for any purpose other than such tax purposes. All provisions of the Certificate and this Agreement are to be construed so as to preserve that tax status under those circumstances. At such time as the Company has more than
	one member that is recognized for U.S. federal tax purposes, appropriate adjustments shall be made to this Agreement to account for the formation of a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes as well as for distributions, maintenance of capital

	Ladies and Gentlemen:




	We have acted as special counsel for Offshore Group Investment Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the 


	Company


	), Vantage Drilling Company, a Cayman Islands exempted
	company (the 


	Parent


	), and certain of their subsidiaries listed on Schedule I hereto (the 


	Subsidiary Guarantors


	) with respect to the preparation of the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the
	


	Registration Statement


	) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 


	Commission


	) in connection with the registration by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
	


	Securities Act


	), of the offer to exchange (the 


	Exchange Offer


	) (i) up to $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Companys 7.5% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2019 (the
	


	Exchange Notes


	) for a like principal amount of the Companys outstanding 7.5% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2019 (the 


	Outstanding Notes


	) and (ii) the guarantees (the
	


	Guarantees


	) of the Parent and the Subsidiary Guarantors of the Outstanding Notes and the Exchange Notes. The Outstanding Notes were issued, and the Exchange Notes will be issued, under an Indenture dated as of
	October 25, 2012 (the 


	Indenture


	), among the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the 


	Trustee


	). Capitalized terms used but not defined
	herein shall have the meaning given such terms in the Indenture.




	We have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise
	identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the Registration Statement, (ii) the Indenture, (iii) the Registration Rights Agreement, (iv) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Vantage Deepwater Drilling, Inc., a Delaware
	corporation and a Subsidiary Guarantor, (v) the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of Vantage Delaware Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a Subsidiary Guarantor, and (vi) such other
	certificates, statutes and other instruments and documents as we considered appropriate for purposes of the opinions hereafter expressed.




	In connection with this opinion, we have assumed that (i) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and represents the valid and binding obligation of, the Trustee,
	(ii) the Registration Statement, and any amendments thereto (including post-effective amendments), will have become effective under the Securities Act and (iii) the Exchange Notes will be issued in compliance with applicable federal and
	state securities laws and in the manner described in the Registration Statement.

	Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the limitations, qualifications, exceptions
	and assumptions set forth herein, and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that, when the Exchange Notes (in the form examined by us) have been duly executed by the Company, the Parent and the
	Subsidiary Guarantors, authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered upon consummation of the Exchange Offer against receipt of Outstanding Notes surrendered in exchange therefor in accordance with the
	terms of the Exchange Offer, the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement, the Exchange Notes will be valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantees will be valid and binding obligations of the Parent and the Subsidiary
	Guarantors.




	The enforceability of the Exchange Notes may be limited or affected by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,
	reorganization, moratorium, liquidation, rearrangement, probate, conservatorship, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance and other similar laws (including court decisions) now or hereafter in effect and affecting the rights and remedies of
	creditors generally or providing for the relief of debtors, (b) the refusal of a particular court to grant (i) equitable remedies, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, specific performance and injunctive relief, or
	(ii) a particular remedy sought under such documents as opposed to another remedy provided for therein or another remedy available at law or in equity, (c) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such remedies are sought in a
	proceeding in equity or at law) and (d) judicial discretion.




	The opinions expressed herein are limited exclusively to
	the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction, domestic or foreign.
	With respect to the opinions set forth above, to the extent such opinions relate to the laws of the Cayman Islands, Hungary, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Cyprus or Poland, we have relied solely on the opinions of Maples and Calder, Reti,
	Antall & Partners Law Firm, Azmi & Associates, Huessen Law Firm, Ioannides Demetriou LLC, PricewaterhouseCoopers Legal Szurminska-Jaworska Sp.K., respectively, a copy of each of which is being filed as an exhibit to the

	The undersigned acknowledges that they have received the Prospectus, dated
	            , 2012 (the 


	Prospectus


	), of Offshore Group Investment Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (


	OGIL


	), and this Letter of
	Transmittal, which together constitute OGILs offer (the 


	Exchange Offer


	) to exchange an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,150,000,000 of 7.5% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2019, and the guarantees thereof,
	which have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 


	Exchange Notes


	), for a like principal amount of the issued and outstanding 7.5% Senior Secured First Lien due 2019, and the guarantees thereof
	(


	Old Notes


	), of OGIL from the holders thereof.




	THE INSTRUCTIONS CONTAINED HEREIN SHOULD BE READ
	CAREFULLY BEFORE THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL IS COMPLETED.




	Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same
	meaning given them in the Prospectus.




	This Letter of Transmittal is to be used by holders of the Old Notes. Tender of the Old
	Notes is to be made using the Automated Tender Offer Program (


	ATOP


	) of The Depository Trust Company (


	DTC


	) pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Prospectus under the caption The Exchange
	OfferProcedures for Tendering. DTC participants that are accepting the Exchange Offer must transmit their acceptance to DTC, which will verify the acceptance and execute a book-entry delivery to Wells Faro Bank, National
	Associations (the 


	Exchange Agent


	) DTC account. DTC will then send a computer-generated message known as an agents message to the Exchange Agent for its acceptance. For you to validly tender your Old
	Notes in the Exchange Offer, the Exchange Agent must receive, prior to the Expiration Date, an agents message under the ATOP procedures that confirms that:



	 





	 




	




	 





	DTC has received your instructions to tender your Old Notes; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	You agree to be bound by the terms of this Letter of Transmittal (including your agreement that the Company may rely on your indication of status as a
	broker-dealer as set forth below).







	If you are a broker-dealer that acquired Old Notes for your own account
	as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, you must indicate in this Letter of Transmittal that you are a broker-dealer and will deliver a Prospectus in connection with any resale of Exchange Notes.




	By using the ATOP procedures to tender the Old Notes, you will not be required to deliver this Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange
	Agent (unless you are a broker-dealer that acquired Old Notes for your own account as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities). However, you will be bound by the terms and conditions, and you will be deemed to have made the
	acknowledgments and the representations and warranties this Letter of Transmittal contains, just as if you had signed it.




	The
	Exchange Notes will be issued in full exchange for the Old Notes in the Exchange Offer, if consummated, on the Settlement Date and will be delivered in book-entry form.



	 


	 


	 








	DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO THE BOOK ENTRY TRANSFER FACILITY OR TO AN ADDRESS OTHER THAN SET
	FORTH ON THE FIRST PAGE FOR THE EXCHANGE AGENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE DELIVERY TO THE EXCHANGE AGENT.






	NOTE: SIGNATURES MUST BE PROVIDED BELOW PLEASE READ THE ACCOMPANYING

	Ladies and Gentlemen:





	Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Exchange Offer, the undersigned hereby tenders to OGIL the above-described aggregate principal amount of Old Notes (or, if delivery is made via ATOP,
	the aggregate principal amount of Old Notes credited by the undersigned to the Exchange Agents account at DTC using ATOP) in exchange for a like aggregate principal amount of Exchange Notes which have been registered under the Securities Act
	of 1933, as amended (the 


	Securities Act


	), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Prospectus, receipt of which is acknowledged, and in this Letter of Transmittal.




	Subject to and effective upon the acceptance for exchange of all or any portion of the Old Notes tendered herewith in accordance with the
	terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer (including, if the Exchange Offer is extended or amended, the terms and conditions of any such extension or amendment), the undersigned hereby sells, assigns and transfers to or upon the order of OGIL all
	right, title and interest in and to such Old Notes as is being tendered herewith. The undersigned hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Exchange Agent as its agent and attorney-in-fact (with full knowledge that the Exchange Agent is also
	acting as agent of OGIL in connection with the Exchange Offer) with respect to the tendered Old Notes, with full power of substitution (such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable power coupled with an interest) subject only to the
	right of withdrawal described in the Prospectus, to (i) deliver Certificates for Old Notes to OGIL together with all accompanying evidences of transfer and authenticity to, or upon the order of, OGIL, upon receipt by the Exchange Agent, as the
	undersigneds agent, of the Exchange Notes to be issued in exchange for such Old Notes, (ii) present Certificates for such Old Notes for transfer, and to transfer the Old Notes on the books of OGIL, and (iii) receive for the account
	of OGIL all benefits and otherwise exercise all rights of beneficial ownership of such Old Notes, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer.





	The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full power and authority to tender, exchange, sell, assign and transfer the Old Notes tendered hereby and that, when the same is
	accepted for exchange, OGIL will acquire good, marketable and unencumbered title thereto, free and clear of all liens, restrictions, charges and encumbrances, and that the Old Notes tendered hereby are not subject to any adverse claims or
	proxies. The undersigned will, upon request, execute and deliver any additional documents deemed by OGIL or the Exchange Agent to be necessary or desirable to complete the exchange, assignment and transfer of the Old Notes tendered hereby, and
	the undersigned will comply with its obligations under the registration rights agreement.





	The name(s) and address(es) of
	the registered holder(s) of the Old Notes tendered hereby should be printed above, if they are not already set forth above, as they appear on the Certificates representing such Old Notes. The Certificate number(s) and the Old Notes that the
	undersigned wishes to tender should be indicated in the appropriate boxes above.




	If any tendered Old Notes are not exchanged
	pursuant to the Exchange Offer for any reason, or if Certificates are submitted for more Old Notes than are tendered or accepted for exchange, Certificates for such nonexchanged or nontendered Old Notes will be returned (or, in the case of Old Notes
	tendered by book-entry transfer, such Old Notes will be credited to an account maintained at DTC), without expense to the tendering holder, promptly following the expiration or termination of the Exchange Offer.




	Tenders of Old Notes pursuant to any one of the procedures described in The Exchange OfferProcedures for Tendering in
	the Prospectus and in the instructions attached hereto will, upon OGILs acceptance for exchange of such tendered Old Notes, constitute a binding agreement between the undersigned and OGIL upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
	Exchange Offer. Under certain circumstances set forth in the Prospectus, OGIL may not be required to accept for exchange any of the Old Notes tendered hereby.




	Unless otherwise indicated herein in the box entitled Special Issuance Instructions below, the undersigned hereby directs that the Exchange Notes be issued in the name(s) of the undersigned
	or, in the case of a book-entry transfer of Old Notes, that such Exchange Notes be credited to the account indicated above maintained at DTC. If applicable, substitute Certificates representing Old Notes not exchanged or not accepted for exchange
	will be issued to the undersigned or, in the case of a book-entry transfer of Old Notes, will be credited to the account indicated above maintained at DTC. Similarly, unless otherwise indicated under Special Delivery Instructions, please
	deliver Exchange Notes to the undersigned at the address shown below the undersigneds signature.





	By tendering Old
	Notes and executing this Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned hereby represents and agrees that: (i) the undersigned is not an affiliate of OGIL, or if it is such an affiliate, that the Exchange Notes may not be offered for
	resale, resold or otherwise transferred without registration under and in compliance with the Prospectus delivery requirement of the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom, (ii) any Exchange Notes to be received by the undersigned are being
	acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (iii) the undersigned has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in a distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of Exchange Notes to be received in the
	Exchange Offer, (iv) if the undersigned is not a broker-dealer, the undersigned is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, a distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of such Exchange Notes, (v) the undersigned has
	full power and authority to transfer the Old Notes in exchange for the Exchange Notes and that OGIL will acquire good and unencumbered title thereto free and clear of any liens, restrictions, charges or encumbrances and not subject to any adverse
	claims, and





	 




	3









	(vi) the undersigned is not acting on behalf of any person or entity that could not truthfully make
	the above representations. By tendering Old Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offer and executing this Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Old Notes that is a broker-dealer represents, and agrees, consistent with certain interpretative letters issued by
	the staff of the Division of Corporate Finance of the Securities and Exchange Commission to third parties, that (A) such Old Notes held by the broker-dealer are held only as a nominee, or (B) such Old Notes were acquired by such
	broker-dealer for its own account as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities and it will deliver the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented from time to time) meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with
	any resale of such Exchange Notes (provided that, by so acknowledging and by delivering a Prospectus, such broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act).






	OGIL has agreed that, subject to the provisions of the registration rights agreement executed in connection with issuance of the Old
	Notes, the Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a Participating Broker-Dealer (as defined below) in connection with resales of Exchange Notes received in exchange for Old Notes, where such Old Notes were
	acquired by such Participating Broker-Dealer for its own account as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, for a period ending on the earlier of (i) 120 days after the Exchange Offer registration statement is declared
	effective or (ii) the date on which a broker-dealer is no longer required to deliver a Prospectus in connection with market-making or other trading activities. In that regard, each broker-dealer who acquired Old Notes for its own account as a
	result of market-making or other trading activities (a 



	Participating Broker-Dealer



	), by tendering such Old Notes and executing this Letter of Transmittal, agrees that, upon receipt of notice from OGIL of the
	occurrence of any event or the discovery of any fact which makes any statement contained or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus untrue in any material respect or which causes the Prospectus to omit to state a material fact necessary to make
	the statements contained or incorporated by reference therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or of the occurrence of certain other events specified in the registration rights agreement, such Participating
	Broker-Dealer will suspend the sale of Exchange Notes pursuant to the Prospectus until OGIL has amended or supplemented the Prospectus to correct such misstatement or omission and has furnished copies of the amended or supplemented Prospectus to the
	Participating Broker-Dealer or OGIL has given notice that the sale of Exchange Notes may be resumed, as the case may be.





	Holders of Old Notes whose Old Notes are accepted for exchange will not receive accrued interest on such Old Notes for any period from
	and after the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on such Old Notes prior to the original issue date of the Exchange Notes or, if no such interest has been paid or duly provided for, will not receive any
	accrued interest on such Old Notes, and the undersigned waives the right to receive any such interest on such Old Notes accrued from and after such Interest Payment Date or, if no such interest has been paid or duly provided for, from and after
	October 25, 2012. The Exchange Notes will bear interest from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid on the Old Notes or, if no interest has been paid, from October 25, 2012.




	The undersigned will, upon request, execute and deliver any additional documents deemed by OGIL to be necessary or desirable to complete
	the sale, assignment and transfer of the Old Notes tendered hereby. All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred in this Letter of Transmittal shall survive the death or incapacity of the undersigned and any obligation of the undersigned
	hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, trustees in bankruptcy, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned. Except as stated in the Prospectus, this tender is irrevocable.

	FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER






	1.



	Delivery of Letter of Transmittal and Certificates



	. 

	This Letter of Transmittal is to be completed either if (a) Certificates are to be forwarded herewith or (b) tenders are to be made pursuant to the
	procedures for tender by book-entry transfer set forth in The Exchange Offer in the Prospectus and an agents message is not delivered. Certificates, or timely confirmation of a book-entry transfer of such Old Notes into the
	Exchange Agents account at DTC, as well as this Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), properly completed and duly executed, with any required signature guarantees, and any other documents required by this Letter of Transmittal must be
	received by the Exchange Agent at its address set forth herein on or prior to the Expiration Date. Tenders by book-entry transfer may also be made by delivering an agents message in lieu thereof. Old Notes may be tendered in whole or in part
	in denominations of principal amount of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000.




	As used herein and in the Prospectus,
	Eligible Institution means a firm or other entity identified in Rule 17Ad-15 under the Exchange Act as an eligible guarantor institution, including (as such terms are defined therein): (i) a bank; (ii) a broker,
	dealer, municipal securities broker or dealer or government securities broker or dealer; (iii) a credit union; (iv) a national securities exchange, registered securities association or clearing agency; or (v) a savings association
	that is a participant in a Securities Transfer Association.




	The method of delivery of Certificates, this Letter of
	Transmittal and all other required documents is at the option and sole risk of the tendering holder, and the delivery will be deemed made only when actually received by the Exchange Agent. If delivery is by mail, then registered mail with return
	receipt requested, properly insured, or overnight delivery service is recommended. In all cases, sufficient time should be allowed to ensure timely delivery.




	OGIL will not accept any alternative, conditional or contingent tenders. Each tendering holder, by execution of a Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile thereof), waives any right to receive any notice of
	the acceptance of such tender.





	2

	.


	Guarantee of Signatures


	. No signature guarantee on this Letter of
	Transmittal is required if:



	 





	 




	




	 





	this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder (which term, for purposes of this document, shall include any participant in DTC whose
	name appears on a security position listing as the owner of the Old Notes (the 


	holder


	)) of Old Notes tendered herewith, unless such holder(s) has completed either the box entitled Special Issuance Instructions
	or the box entitled Special Delivery Instructions above,







	or



	 





	 




	




	 





	such Old Notes are tendered for the account of a firm that is an Eligible Institution.







	In all other cases, an Eligible Institution must guarantee the signature(s) on this Letter of Transmittal. See Instruction 5.





	3.



	Inadequate Space


	. If the space provided in the box captioned Description of Old Notes is
	inadequate, the Certificate number(s) and or the principal amount of Old Notes and any other required information should be listed on a separate signed schedule that is attached to this Letter of Transmittal.





	4.



	Partial Tenders and Withdrawal Rights


	. Tenders of Old Notes will be accepted only in denominations of
	principal amount of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000. If less than all the Old Notes evidenced by any Certificate submitted are to be tendered, fill in the principal amount of Old Notes that are to be tendered in the box entitled
	Principal Amount of Old Notes Tendered. In such case, new Certificate(s) for the remainder of the Old Notes that were evidenced by your old Certificate(s) will only be sent to the holder of the Old Notes, promptly after the Expiration
	Date. All Old Notes represented by Certificates delivered to the Exchange Agent will be deemed to have been tendered unless otherwise indicated.




	Except as otherwise provided herein, tenders of Old Notes may be withdrawn at any time on or prior to the Expiration Date. In order for a withdrawal to be effective on or prior to that time, a written or
	facsimile transmission of such notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Exchange Agent at one of its addresses set forth above or in the Prospectus on or prior to the Expiration Date. Any such notice of withdrawal must specify the name of
	the person who tendered the Old Notes to be withdrawn, the aggregate principal amount of Old Notes to be withdrawn, and (if Certificates have been tendered) the name of the registered holder of the Old Notes as set forth on the Certificate, if
	different from that of the person who tendered such Old Notes. If Certificates have been delivered or otherwise identified to the Exchange Agent, then prior to the physical release of such Certificates, the tendering holder must submit the serial
	numbers shown on the particular Certificates to be withdrawn and the signature on the notice of withdrawal must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution, except in the case of Old Notes tendered for the account of an Eligible Institution. If Old
	Notes have been tendered pursuant to the procedures for book-entry transfer set forth in the Prospectus under The Exchange Offer, the notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at DTC to be credited with the
	withdrawal of Old Notes, in




	 




	7








	which case a notice of withdrawal will be effective if delivered to the Exchange Agent by written, telegraphic, telex or facsimile transmission. Withdrawals of tenders of Old Notes may not be
	rescinded. Old Notes properly withdrawn will not be deemed validly tendered for purposes of the Exchange Offer, but may be retendered at any subsequent time on or prior to the Expiration Date by following any of the procedures described in the
	Prospectus under The Exchange Offer.




	All questions as to the validity, form and eligibility (including time of
	receipt) of such withdrawal notices will be determined by OGIL, in its sole discretion, whose determination shall be final and binding on all parties. OGIL, any affiliates or assigns of OGIL, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall not be under
	any duty to give any notification of any irregularities in any notice of withdrawal or incur any liability for failure to give any such notification. Any Old Notes that have been tendered but that are withdrawn will be returned to the holder thereof
	without cost to such holder promptly after withdrawal.





	5.



	Signatures on Letter of Transmittal, Assignments and
	Endorsements


	. If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the Old Notes tendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond exactly with the name(s) as written on the face of the Certificate(s) without
	alteration, enlargement or any change whatsoever.




	If any Old Notes tendered hereby are owned of record by two or more joint
	owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal.




	If any tendered Old Notes are registered in different name(s)
	on several Certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate Letters of Transmittal (or facsimiles thereof) as there are different registrations of Certificates.




	If this Letter of Transmittal or any Certificates or bond powers are signed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians,
	attorneys-in-fact, officers of corporations or others acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such persons should so indicate when signing and, unless waived by OGIL, must submit proper evidence satisfactory to OGIL, in its sole
	discretion, of each such persons authority to so act.




	When this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered
	owner(s) of the Old Notes listed and transmitted hereby, no endorsement(s) of Certificate(s) or separate bond power(s) is required unless Exchange Notes are to be issued in the name of a person other than the registered holder(s). Signature(s) on
	such Certificate(s) or bond power(s) must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.




	If this Letter of Transmittal is signed
	by a person other than the registered owner(s) of the Old Notes listed, the Certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate bond powers, signed exactly as the name or names of the registered owner(s) appear(s) on the Certificates, and
	also must be accompanied by such opinions of counsel, certifications and other information as OGIL or the Trustee for the Old Notes may require in accordance with the restrictions on transfer applicable to the Old Notes. Signatures on such
	Certificates or bond powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.




	6.


	Special Issuance and Delivery
	Instructions


	. If Exchange Notes are to be issued in the name of a person other than the signer of this Letter of Transmittal, or if Exchange Notes are to be sent to someone other than the signer of this Letter of Transmittal or to an
	address other than that shown above, the appropriate boxes on this Letter of Transmittal should be completed. Certificates not exchanged will be returned by mail or, if tendered by book-entry transfer, by crediting the account indicated above
	maintained at DTC. See Instruction 4.





	7

	.


	Irregularities


	. OGIL will determine, in its sole
	discretion, all questions as to the form of documents, validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for exchange of any tender of Old Notes, which determination shall be final and binding on all parties. OGIL reserves the
	absolute right to reject any and all tenders determined by it not to be in proper form or the acceptance of which, or exchange for which may, in the view of counsel to OGIL be unlawful. OGIL also reserves the absolute right, subject to applicable
	law, to waive any of the conditions of the Exchange Offer set forth in the Prospectus under The Exchange Offer or any conditions or irregularities in any tender of Old Notes of any particular holder whether or not similar conditions or
	irregularities are waived in the case of other holders. OGILs interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer (including this Letter of Transmittal and the instructions hereto) will be final and binding. No tender of Old
	Notes will be deemed to have been validly made until all irregularities with respect to such tender have been cured or waived. OGIL, any affiliates or assigns of OGIL, the Exchange Agent, or any other person shall not be under any duty to give
	notification of any irregularities in tenders or incur any liability for failure to give such notification.





	8.



	Questions, Requests for Assistance and Additional Copies


	. Questions and requests for assistance may be directed to the Exchange Agent at its address and telephone number set forth on the front of this Letter of Transmittal.
	Additional copies of the Prospectus and the Letter of Transmittal may be obtained from the Exchange Agent or from your broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee.




	 




	8









	9.



	Backup Withholding; Substitute Form W-9


	. Under U.S. federal
	income tax law, a holder (including, for purposes of this section, beneficial owners of the Old Notes) whose tendered Old Notes are accepted for exchange is required to provide the Exchange Agent with such holders correct taxpayer
	identification number (


	TIN


	) on Substitute Form W-9 below. If the Exchange Agent is not provided with the correct TIN, the Internal Revenue Service (the 


	IRS


	) may subject the holder or other payee to
	a $50 penalty. In addition, payments to such holders or other payees with respect to Old Notes exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Offer may be subject to backup withholding at a rate equal to 28%.




	The box in Part 2 of the Substitute Form W-9 may be checked if the tendering holder has not been issued a TIN and has applied for a TIN
	or intends to apply for a TIN in the near future. If the box in Part 2 is checked, the holder or other payee must also complete the box captioned Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number below in order to avoid backup withholding.
	Notwithstanding that the box in Part 2 is checked and the box captioned Certificate of Awaiting Taxpayer Identification Number is completed, the holder will be subject to backup withholding on all payments made prior to the time a properly certified
	TIN is provided to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent will retain such amounts withheld during the 60-day period following the date of the Substitute Form W-9. If the holder furnishes the Exchange Agent with its TIN within 60 days after the date
	of the Substitute Form W-9, the amounts retained during the 60-day period will be remitted to the holder and no further amounts shall be retained or withheld from payments made to the holder thereafter. If, however, the holder has not provided the
	Exchange Agent with its TIN within such 60-day period, amounts withheld will be remitted to the IRS as backup withholding. In addition, backup withholding will apply to all payments made thereafter until a correct TIN is provided.




	Certain holders (including, among others, corporations, financial institutions and certain foreign persons) may not be subject to the
	backup withholding and reporting requirements. Such holders should nevertheless complete the attached Substitute Form W-9 and write Exempt on the face thereof, to avoid possible erroneous backup withholding. A foreign person may qualify
	as an exempt recipient by submitting a properly completed and appropriate IRS Form W-8, signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to that holders exempt status. Please consult the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer
	Identification Number on Substitute Form W-9 for additional guidance on which holders are exempt from backup withholding.




	Backup withholding is not an additional U.S. federal income tax. Rather, the U.S. federal income tax liability of a person subject to
	backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.





	10.



	Waiver of Conditions


	. OGIL reserves the absolute right to waive satisfaction of any or all conditions
	enumerated in the Prospectus.





	11

	.


	No Conditional Tenders


	. No alternative, conditional or contingent
	tenders will be accepted. All tendering holders of Old Notes, by execution of this Letter of Transmittal, shall waive any right to receive notice of the acceptance of Old Notes for exchange.




	Neither OGIL, the Exchange Agent nor any other person is obligated to give notice of any defect or irregularity with respect to any
	tender of Old Notes nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.





	12.



	Lost,
	Destroyed or Stolen Certificates


	. If any Certificate(s) representing Old Notes have been lost, destroyed or stolen, the holder should promptly notify the Exchange Agent. The holder will then be instructed as to the steps that must be
	taken in order to replace the Certificate(s). This Letter of Transmittal and related documents cannot be processed until the procedures for replacing lost, destroyed or stolen Certificate(s) have been followed.





	13.



	Security Transfer Taxes


	. Holders who tender their Old Notes for exchange will not be obligated to pay any
	transfer taxes in connection therewith. If, however, Exchange Notes are to be delivered to, or are to be issued in the name of, any person other than the registered holder of the Old Notes tendered, or if a transfer tax is imposed for any reason
	other than the exchange of Old Notes in connection with the Exchange Offer, then the amount of any such transfer tax (whether imposed on the registered holder or any other persons) will be payable by the tendering holder. If satisfactory evidence of
	payment of such taxes or exemption therefrom is not submitted with the Letter of Transmittal, the amount of such transfer taxes will be billed directly to such tendering holder.
