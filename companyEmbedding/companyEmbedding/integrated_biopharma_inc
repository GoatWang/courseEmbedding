Integrated BioPharma, Inc. Announces the Acquisition of a Premium, Organic Beverage Business

BevNET.com Staff Apr. 2, 2007 at 4:05 pm









        More 











HILLSIDE, NJ April 2007 – Integrated BioPharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: INBP)announced the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of BevSpec, Inc., including SYZMO ENERGY(TM), a certified-organic energy drink presently being distributed, and a newly-developed line of low-glycemic, healthful carbonated beverages. BevSpec’s assets were acquired by The Organic Beverage Company, a wholly- owned subsidiary of Integrated BioPharma, Inc. Unlike typical diet soft drinks, which use artificial sweeteners, The Organic Beverage Company’s products use only natural ingredients. SYZMO ENERGY(TM), BevSpec’s first product offering and the first certified organic mainstream energy drink, debuted at the National Association of Convenience Stores annual conference in 2005. It was developed for consumers of energy drinks sensitive to health and wellness considerations. In addition to the distribution already established by BevSpec, The Organic Beverage Company expects to expand into the convenience channel in 2007 and to further expand its line of premium organic beverage products.
E. Gerald Kay, Chief Executive Officer of Integrated BioPharma, Inc., said “We believe the market is looking for healthier beverages with only natural sweeteners and organic ingredients. The acquisition of these assets allows us to expand our line of healthful products into consumer beverages.  We expect to realize significant benefits and synergies with this acquisition as a result of the experience and relationships developed in our nutraceutical health drinks business.”     

About Integrated BioPharma, Inc.
Integrated BioPharma is a unique grouping of companies presently serving the varied needs of the health care industry. Through its nutraceutical business, the Company creates, develops, manufactures and markets products worldwide. The Company’s biotechnology business uses its patented plant-based technology to produce vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Its pharmaceutical business operates a GMP facility for the production and sale of Paclitaxel and related drugs and provides technical services through its contract research organization. Further information is available at www.ibiopharma.com.

Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

A Little More Normal

















A Little More Normal

“My entire world sort of clicked off. I didn't hear anything. I didn't see anything. And the only thing that I could think of was: I'm going to be dead in six months.”
This is James, looking back at 1988, the year the Dow closed above 2100, the Hubble Space Telescope was turned on, and James was diagnosed with HIV. “I'm a survivor of domestic violence, child molestation, depression,” he says with some pride. Even so, James knew he was about to enter the toughest fight of his life.
 After all, while HIV/AIDS awareness was still relatively new in 1988, James was seeing growing evidence of something much bigger. “First, there would be the fever and then there was the immense weight loss along with the Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions that would appear on the body,” James says. “A person would die and sometimes it would happen over a week.”
 James also explained that, since doctors had just begun researching HIV, there were almost no treatment options available. “The medication at the time was fairly nonexistent,” he recalls. Of the side effects, he says “the medication that they had at the time was even worse than the disease itself.”
 Thanks to years of investment and hard work by America’s biopharmaceutical companies, and other health care stakeholders, things have changed dramatically – and patients likes James, who can look back 29 years in near-disbelief, are proof.
 Brian, a researcher developing HIV/AIDS medications for nearly 20 years, is astounded by how far treatment has come. “The progress is actually quite miraculous,” he says. “In the early days, the goal was just keeping patients alive as long as possible.  Resistance was rampant and the regimens were not tolerable for many patients, but the alternative was death.  Frankly, both options were horrible.  Fast forward 30 years and now we have several one-pill, once-a-day treatment options for patients and their physicians to choose from.”  
 “They can live a normal life – a healthy, successful life.”
 Today, the outlook has never been more promising with more than 50 medicines and vaccines in development to treat, prevent, or help with the disease impact of HIV/AIDS.
 As Brian explains, treatment is no longer simply about survival, but enabling individuals to regain the quality of life they once had. “It is extremely motivating when we hear that a physician has a patient who is benefiting, that the new [medicines] we've brought forward have allowed the patient to regain weight, reverse the progression of their disease and essentially have a new life ahead of them.”
James understands the sentiment personally – and recognizes the network that helped him back. “My family, my doctors who were trying to make sure that I got the right medications to keep me going,” he says, “the programs that helped me find housing, sent me back to school, and helped me to better myself.” 
  “I have a great doctor. Most of doctors that I've had have been very good and this last one has been just fantastic.  We have gotten me to a point now where my numbers are just fantastic.”
 James’s experience motivated him to help others. He began volunteering at San Francisco City Hall by taking calls, helping around the office, and any job in between. This volunteer work led to HIV community activism – and a run for office. While he may not have won his election, James continued to give back to others, providing the same kind of support he is so thankful to have received. 
 James recently lost his partner to AIDS and his brother to cancer. Still, he knew he had to keep moving forward. 
 “The thing that gives me hope is just being able to wake up every day,” he says. “I will get back up.”
 Brian knows there’s still a long way to go. “There are people who are alive today because of the work that we do,” he acknowledges. “The work is often very quiet, very slow moving, very frustrating. But over time it has a major impact on thousands of people.”
And Brian sees even greater hope ahead.
“I don't take no for an answer,” he says. “The power of imagination and innovation is incredible and I see it every day in the eyes of my colleagues.”  “Science is real and the key to solving problems. We just need to find the right people to bring together, collaborate, and find a solution.”  
James is grateful for Brian’s – and many other researchers’ – tenacity. “I'm not sure how to explain it any better,” he says, “than it just makes me feel a little more normal.”
