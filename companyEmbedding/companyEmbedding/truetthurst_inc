Nestled in the heart of the Dry Creek Valley, there are 26 very special acres we call Truett Hurst. Zinfandel and Petite Sirah vineyards, Dry Creek, 5 acres of garden and a vibrant tasting room made of eco-friendly materials are just some of the things that make us unique. Where else can you take in Coho Salmon, Steelhead trout, otters, ducks, sheep, herbs, olives, beneficial insect habitat, heirloom fruits and vegetables, all over a glass of delicious wine?The story really begins in the vineyard, where we sourcefruit from the best hillside, old vine vineyards in DryCreek. The style of wine, be it spicy and bold, or fruitdriven and elegant, is dictated by the vineyard. Understandingthis and allowing for the authentic translation ofits terroir is paramount for making unforgettable wines.Small, open top fermentations, mixing the cap gentlywith punch downs and selection of only the best Frenchand American oak are only part of the care that go intohandcrafting our wines.Contact us to find a local retailer near you.

About Us - Truett Hurst Inc.

















































































About Us
Our home in Dry Creek is a truly vibrant place: changing with the season, Dry Creek is filled with steelhead and salmon in the winter months, while birds, butterflies and beneficial insects visit the twisted old olive trees and habitat gardens through the rest of the seasons. Goats, chickens, sheep and a vineyard ripening with luscious fruit create a space that captures the imagination.
We have 26 acres with 15 acres of Zinfandel and Petite Sirah planted. Our intimate and inviting tasting room is nestled near the babbling Dry Creek. French doors lead out to a splendid patio with eye catching views and all the charm our valley offers. 
For our vineyards, we took cuttings from two Old Vine Zinfandel vineyards: St. Peter’s Church and Du Pratt to plant two of our blocks. In the spirit of our Italian predecessors we selected a Primitivo clone for bright, vibrant fruit characters and two selections of Petite Sirah to add color and structure to our wines.
