2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

As the recent market crisis unfolded, one area of the private equity landscape that commentators suggested would inadvertently benefit from market conditions was secondary funds and their limited partners.
The reality to date, however, has been different, with very few transactions clearing the market (at the time of writing) due to a continued dislocation between buyers’ and sellers’ pricing expectations. In this chapter we explore this dynamic and consider the prospects for the secondary market.
Why secondaries?
Before we consider current market conditions in closer detail, let us first remind ourselves of the rationale for investing in secondary funds. Investors in secondary funds can expect similar benefits to investors in traditional private equity funds including returns that are potentially superior relative to quoted markets. In addition, secondary funds offer the potential to acquire high quality assets at discounts to net asset value (NAV), benefit from mitigating the ‘J-curve’ due to buying mature portfolios likely to return capital more quickly than a traditional private equity fund and can provide investors with immediate vintage year diversification.
Whilst investing in secondary funds is typically the default option for institutional investors looking to gain exposure to secondary deal flow, it is not the only option. As we will explore later, for some experienced investors, investing in secondary transactions rather than specialised secondary funds is potentially a way of achieving many of the above attractive characteristics of secondary investing, without the double layer of fees associated with the secondary fund model.
A recent history
In late 2008, amid the market turmoil following the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, estimates of available secondary purchasing capacity were in the region of US$40 billion, whilst estimates of the potential supply of opportunities from sellers were in the region of US$140 billion.1 The reported supply of opportunities soared as LPs grappled desperately for much needed liquidity and looked to deal with the ‘denominator effect’, whereby the crash in equity markets forced their private equity exposure rapidly above their target allocations in percentage terms. This has impacted a large proportion of investors, with over 60% of LPs surveyed by Probitas Partners conceding to being at or above their target allocation to the asset class.2 Consequently, the widely accepted expectation was that this supply-demand imbalance would allow buyers to dictate prices amid a period of significant deal activity in the secondary market. However, this expectation has not been borne out in reality.
Actual deal activity between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the present was modest with various secondary intermediaries suggesting transaction volume in 2009 was down 50% to 60% compared to 2008. We believe that there have been three main impediments to deal activity:

Buyer-seller dislocation: pricing expectations between buyers and sellers remain very different, so only the deals with the most motivated sellers have completed. Buyers are cautious, given the uncertainty surrounding expected future operational performance of underlying portfolio companies and the validity of GP valuations. As such, bids made in the first half of 2009 saw 60% to 80% discounts to fourth quarter 2008 NAVs for many buyout funds, emphasising that only the most desperate sellers would transact. 
LP liquidity crisis (temporarily?) abated: the number of sellers forced to accept any price offered for their positions due to an intense liquidity need has been lower than expected. This is thanks to the lack of capital calls from GPs (reducing the need for available capital) and the rebound in equity markets (reducing the impact of the ‘denominator effect’). 
Significant divergence between available assets from sellers and buyer preferences: much of the estimated supply of opportunities from sellers were 2006-08 vintage mega buyout funds (often largely unfunded positions) as LPs looked to selectively reduce their unfunded liability in out-of-favour strategies in order to allow them to make fresh commitments to 2009-10 vintage funds. However, the aforementioned Probitas Partners’ survey concluded that buyers in the secondary market are most interested in mid-cap buyout and growth strategies and are particularly averse to mega buyout funds. This is either due to concerns about the underlying assets being over-valued and over-levered during the boom period, or where the funds remain only partially drawn down meaning there are relatively few assets for secondary buyers to value. 

Secondary funds: view and outlook
The widespread excitement about secondaries appears, on the face of it, to share some characteristics with recent periods of over exuberance in other areas of the private equity market. Similar to the mega buyout frenzy in 2005-07, we are cautious about the widely recognised ‘strategy du jour’.
So why should investors be cautious about investing in secondary funds?
The headline estimated levels of supply of opportunities do not tell the full story as many sellers do not have to sell. As such, they have held on to their positions, hoping to benefit from any upside, and they might choose to continue to do so if they do not face significant liquidity problems.
In addition, the headline level of demand is understated due to the emergence of new buyers into the market attracted by potentially outsized returns. There is a lot of capital chasing secondary opportunities (see Figure 01 showing dedicated secondary funds raised in recent years).
A report published by Cogent Partners in 2009 emphasised the emergence of new entrants, noting that over 50% of the bids received in the first half of 2009 were from “non-traditional secondary buyers”.3

1 Pantheon, Take Note: Secondaries, April 2009
2 Probitas Partners, Second Thoughts Newsletter, Volume1, Number 1, July 2009
3 Cogent Partners, Secondary pricing analysis, Interim update, Summer 2009

These buyers include funds of funds, sovereign wealth funds and large pension schemes, many of whom are natural buyers of the plain vanilla LP stakes available on the secondary market. The combination of these factors reduces the perceived supply and demand dislocation between buyers and sellers which secondary managers and intermediaries have been advertising for some time.
This appears to be having an impact on secondary pricing which increased sharply in the second half of 2009 (see Figure 02). Ironically, some specialist secondary funds invested very little during the pricing trough in late 2008 to early 2009, despite having deployed aggressively in 2005-07 when prices paid were, on average, much higher relative to the prevailing NAV at the time.
An additional challenge for potential investors in secondary funds to overcome is the high fees that are charged by secondary managers. Fees charged in the investment period are typically high at 1.0% to 1.5% on committed capital.
However, some managers continue to charge on committed capital throughout the life of the vehicle which leads to a substantial fee drag in the latter years of a vehicle’s life.
Figure 03 emphasises this, with the fees charged by secondary managers significantly outweighing the fees charged by the underlying managers in the latter years of a secondary fund’s life. Given the responsibility lay with the direct manager to actively own the business and manage the exit process, this represents an inappropriate drag on fees for the secondary fund investor.
As with other strategies in private equity and indeed broader illiquid alternatives, given the scarcity of capital and challenging fundraising environment, we fully expect investors to be able to secure a fairer deal on fees with secondary managers raising funds over the next 12 to 24 months.
So what does the future hold?
Broadly speaking, some level of stability in the wider economy and therefore transparency on the operating performance of underlying portfolio companies has proven to be necessary for secondary deal activity to occur. Sustained economic stability also leads to increased activity in the primary market which has a knock-on effect on the secondary market as capital calls crystallise potential liquidity issues for some struggling LPs. We have seen both increased economic confidence and an uptick in (primary and secondary) deal activity through late 2009 and early 2010 (albeit from a very low base). As noted, however, this secondary deal activity has been clearing at a higher price relative to early 2009 – that is, secondary buyers have had to increase their prices for any meaningful deal flow to occur in the secondary market.
If liquidity concerns do not heighten in the near term, buyers (including specialist secondary managers who have raised large dedicated vehicles in anticipation of a wave of deal activity that has not yet come to fruition) will continue to be forced to increase bids to deploy their capital in order to meet sellers’ expectations (as shown in Figure 02). This, combined with increasing demand for secondary deals potentially bidding away some of the value on acquisition, explains why the market opportunity in secondary investing is not currently compelling, in our view.
We also anticipate an increase in the trend of buyers forcing sellers to slice up their portfolios to allow the acquirers to be selective over which positions they take on. During 2009, this was a theme of the market, with large auctioned transactions not closing. Instead, buyers took advantage of their improved bargaining position by selecting specific investments within a portfolio that they considered particularly attractive.
Given the increasing number of reasons for secondary sales (for example, short-term liquidity, relief from future calls, risk reduction, portfolio management, and so on), we also predict an increasing volume of structured transactions. These could include secondary buyers providing a solution to LPs by sharing the burden of capital calls (and therefore sharing in the upside of future distributions). It could also involve secondary buyers participating in the raising of follow-on capital for funds (for example, annex funds) or individual portfolio companies (for example, direct secondaries) that are in need of fresh capital. Often buyers are able to negotiate a ‘preferred equity’ structure in these deals.
As explained earlier in the chapter, an increased interest from non-traditional buyers has been a feature of the secondary market in 2009 and we expect this trend to continue over the medium term. Despite the caution noted above, experienced and long-term investors in the asset class (such as some large, governance-rich pension funds and sovereign wealth funds) are well positioned to opportunistically invest in secondary transactions as part of their broader private equity programmes. This allows them to enjoy the traditional benefits of secondary investing (for example, more rapid capital deployment mitigating the ‘J-curve’ and vintage year diversification) without the double layer of fees and pressure to deploy a certain level of capital associated with the specialised secondary fund investing model. For certain investors, given the cyclical nature of secondary investing, participating in secondary transactions tactically as and when opportunities present themselves at certain points in the cycle, could be an appealing alternative to strategically committing capital to secondary funds on an ongoing basis.

Press Release


Willis Towers Watson launches high active share fund





                June 20, 2016
            






















LONDON, 20 June 2016 – Willis Towers Watson has launched an  equity fund for institutional investors which contains the top  unconstrained-equity ideas of the world’s best stock pickers. The new fund,  called Global Equity Focus Fund (GEFF), follows five other pooled funds - including  a diversified multi-asset fund (now with a ten-year track record), two liquid  alternative funds, and an alternative credit fund - which wrap Willis Towers  Watson’s best investment ideas. 
The new fund,  which provides daily liquidity, comprises the top 10 to 15 stock picks from  eight top-rated investment managers with risk managed at the portfolio level.
Paul Berriman,  Global Head of Willis Towers Watson’s funds business, said: “Our new equity  focus fund is specifically designed to provide institutional investors with  targeted access to the world’s best equity ideas with high levels of  transparency of the underlying investments, at competitive fees. This is  consistent with our vision to help all our clients - whether advisory or  delegated – to achieve the best net-of-fees returns for the right level of risk  and, if the vehicles don’t exist, we’ll build them.”
The company’s  funds provide portfolio construction, risk management and manager-selection  decisions, while using best-in-class asset managers for underlying security  selection and trading strategies. 
David Shapiro,  GEFF portfolio manager at Willis Towers Watson said: “When looking at what was  available to those clients wishing to invest in equities, we were dispirited by  the preponderance of expensive index-hugger-type products. So we built  something very different. We would assert that this high active share fund,  offered at such a competitive price, is a world first. While not for every  institutional investor, we are confident that many disillusioned institutional  equity investors, both large and small, will recognise the opportunity  presented by this approach.”
The company’s six  pooled funds have total assets under management of around US$5bn.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
