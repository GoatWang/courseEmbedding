The mark consists of Literal Elements: The wording "The Work Injury Center", all in caps, with a black line under "Work Injury."

The literal elements are arranged as follows: The word "The" is at the top, in smaller font, the next line, in larger font is "Work Injury," lastly, the next line is "Center". The stylized elements are to the right of the previously described literal elements and consists of a black-outlined orange triangle. Within the orange triangle is the simplified or "stick" image of a man's body, all in black, facing right, with his right knee slightly bent, and his left hip bent to the left, his upper torso bent over to the right, his left hand on his left hip, as if he is in pain, with black "flare" elements coming out of his right knee, and extending out of the triangle, again, intended to intimate that the man is in pain. Finally, in the upper right portion of the triangle, just outside the triangle, is a circle which purports to be the man's head.
