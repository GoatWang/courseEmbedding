Fitch Affirms Three Classes of World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2012-B | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Three Classes of World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2012-B
    





September 18, 2014 02:43 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings affirms three classes 
      of World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2012-B as follows:
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B at 'AAsf'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating actions are based on available credit enhancement (CE) and 
      loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within 
      Fitch's expectations. Under the current structure and CE, the securities 
      are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the assigned 
      ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms 
      of the documents.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of World Omni Financial Corp.'s retail 
      auto loan originations, the strength of its servicing capabilities, and 
      the sound financial and legal structure of the transaction.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance with losses within Fitch's initial expectations with rising 
      loss coverage and multiple levels consistent with the current ratings. A 
      material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the 
      asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2012-B - 
      Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset 
      class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, 
      and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global Structured Finance 
      Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
    

      Applicable Criteria and Related Research:
    

      --'Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS' (April 7, 2014);
    

      --'Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria' (August 4, 2014);
    

      --Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' (April 17, 2012)
    

      --'World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2012-B - Appendix' (October 15, 
      2012).

      Fitch Affirms Two Classes of World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2012-B
    





August 03, 2016 03:44 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings affirms two 
      outstanding classes of the World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2012-B at 
      'AAAsf'. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this press 
      release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating affirmation is based on available credit enhancement and loss 
      performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within Fitch's 
      expectations. Based on the current structure and credit enhancement, the 
      securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the 
      assigned ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with 
      the terms of the documents.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of World Omni Financial Corp.'s retail 
      auto loan originations, the strength of its servicing capability, and 
      the sound financial and legal structure of the transaction.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy, and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. Therefore, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      World Omni Auto Receivables Trust 2012-B
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
