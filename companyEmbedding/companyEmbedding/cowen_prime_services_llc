Cowen Group, Inc. to Acquire Concept Capital Markets




Furthers Cowen’s Strategy of Providing Best-in-Class, 
      Non-conflicted Products and Services






July 15, 2015 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cowen Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:COWN) (“Cowen” or the “Company”) and Concept 
      Capital Markets, LLC (“Concept Capital”) today announced the signing of 
      a definitive agreement under which Cowen will acquire Concept Capital, a 
      leading independent provider of prime brokerage services. While 
      financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, Cowen Group expects the 
      acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 2015. The transaction was 
      approved by the board of directors of both companies.
    


      “Concept Capital’s strong presence among emerging hedge fund clients 
      complements Cowen’s focus on providing best-in-class products and 
      services to institutional clients,” said Peter A. Cohen, Chairman and 
      CEO of Cowen Group. “Given the changing prime broker landscape, many 
      investment managers are looking for alternative prime solutions and 
      there are a limited number of organizations offering a similar kind of 
      value proposition as Concept Capital on Cowen’s platform. Combining 
      Concept Capital with Cowen’s business will allow us to better service 
      these funds by providing focused prime broker services, supported by 
      non-conflicted trade execution and world-class equity research.”
    

      Jeffrey M. Solomon, President of Cowen Group added, “Concept Capital has 
      proven to be a value added partner to its client base for a number of 
      years. By joining forces, we have an opportunity to grow with Concept's 
      existing clients and further develop its competitive offering for an 
      underserved part of the emerging investment manager community that is 
      looking to outperform. In addition, Concept's clients will benefit from 
      access to Cowen’s high quality institutional equity research, investment 
      conferences, and suite of electronic products. We believe this 
      represents a compelling opportunity to deliver our premier institutional 
      products and services as a value-added partner that is invested in 
      helping clients produce long-term investment outperformance."
    

      “We have found the ideal partner with Cowen,” said Michael S. Rosen and 
      Jack D. Seibald, Co-Founders of Concept Capital. “Cowen and Concept 
      Capital share the same values, including a commitment to putting clients 
      first. This transaction is a unique opportunity to align with a 
      well-respected financial services organization that understands our 
      client’s needs from the standpoint of a client. We believe that our 
      alignment with Cowen provides complementary strengths that will enable 
      us to significantly enhance the breadth of services to our clients. 
      Importantly, the transaction will not impact client accounts held with 
      our various clearing firms, nor the manner in which clients are served 
      day to day.”
    

      The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015 and is 
      subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval.
    

      Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP acted as legal advisor to Cowen and Seward 
      & Kissel LLP acted as legal advisor to Concept Capital on this 
      transaction.

Leverage an established and experienced team of traders, support staff, and trading and reporting infrastructure.
Exceptional value that functions as client’s trading desk, without the cost of building and operating such capability.
Agency-only model avoids potential conflicts that may arise at firm’s making markets or trading for their own accounts.
Allows clients to concentrate resources on alpha-generating functions, including research, portfolio construction and risk management.



Our Differentiated Model

Our traders and operational support staff truly function as an extension of client’s firm.
Our team processes all documentation, opens broker relationships as desired by client, and leverages existing ones for client’s benefit.
Our traders execute directly with designated brokers in client’s name, representing ourselves to those brokers as client’s traders. This reinforces the client’s “brand” in the broker-dealer community, but also leverages our existing outsourced trading relationships with such brokers for purposes of research, conference attendance, corporate access, and syndicate.
Client trades with designated brokers are executed at commission rates negotiated by client and broker. Commission budgets are set and continuously monitored by our traders to optimize the services client needs to manage his/her portfolio, such as research and corporate access.
Our operations staff performs daily trade recaps with all brokers, and reconciles activity with client’s prime broker/custodian.
We provide clients with real-time portfolio monitoring tool, shadow reporting, and multi-custodian portal as part of the base service agreement.



 

Commission Management 

Cowen offers fully compliant soft-dollar and commissions sharing management and access to independent research and brokerage services.
Our commission management team can implement and oversee a commission management program with Cowen executions or executions with away brokers to pay for research and brokerage related services via soft dollars or commission sharing agreements with other broker-dealers.
 


Our commission management portal provides a virtual window for the submission of invoices, monitoring payments, tracking balances, and producing management reports across multiple brokerage relationships.
Cowen’s commission management program does not charge our clients or the executing broker any fee.


 

Financing and Stock Loan 

Our clients benefit from a variety of financing options and efficient short term borrowing.
Portfolio Financing
Cowen’s offering provides our clients with a variety of portfolio financing options. These options will depend on specific investment strategies, asset classes, gross and net exposures, and other considerations. Financing options range from traditional Reg T (initial 50% margin) accounts, to those with varying degrees of enhanced leverage, including full Portfolio Margining (15% margin). The firm’s experienced client service personnel works with clients and the clearing firms to optimize account financing using internal risk tools.


Stock Loan
Short sales of easy-to-borrow securities is facilitated by electronic approvals through the various execution systems, and the firm’s client support staff works diligently and efficiently to locate hard-to-borrow securities through each of our clearing firms.
Fully-Paid For Stock Loan
Our client service team also reviews client accounts daily in search of fully paid for securities that are designated as hard-to-borrow and will attempt to facilitate lending of such securities on behalf of clients by the respective clearing firms, allowing clients to earn incremental returns on their holdings.


 

Middle and Back Office Support 

At Cowen we understand that our clients are principally focused on making the investment and trading decisions for their client assets, and that they depend on us to deal with the administrative and operational matters related to their account. The firm prides itself on being client-driven, and aims to provide our clients with a level of comfort that they have a capable team supporting their business.
New Account On-Boarding
Our team of seasoned professionals can provide advice on how best to execute a new fund launch and to grow an investment management business, as well as accommodate the efficient on-boarding of new client accounts, and provide trading, middle and back office, operational and technology solutions.


Operational Support and Portfolio Reconciliation
Our operations and support team assists clients with all post-trade activities:

Clearance and settlement
Incoming and outgoing wire transfers
Security level reconciliation for realized and unrealized P/L and position quantities
Portfolio report preparation
Delivery of portfolio accounting reports via our secure web portal and/or automated e-mails
Client account data can be made readily available for enhanced portfolio and/or risk analytics and reporting, should those be contracted for separately
Interaction with custodians, away executing brokers, fund administrators, and auditors, as necessary, on behalf of client accounts



 

Pre- & Post-Trade Compliance 

Through the EMS and OMS providers integrated with Cowen, our clients can implement a variety of pre-trade compliance rules to monitor the activity in their portfolios and ensure compliance with those guidelines.


Our comprehensive portfolio reporting and analytics provides our clients the tools to review and analyze their portfolios for post-trade compliance.

Capital Introduction 

We view capital introduction as a serious reputational commitment by our firm and approach the effort from the investor’s perspective. We focus on the investment merits of each manager, and make every effort to understand their investment strategies, operational capabilities, and performance track record before agreeing to introduce them to allocators.
Benefit to Managers
We work to gain a clear understanding of our clients’ investment strategies, goals, and objectives, which allows us to conduct a consultative approach to capital development, including providing assistance in assessing our clients’ marketing materials, critiquing their investment presentations, preparing them for investor meetings, and opining on their overall marketing strategy. We also leverage the information flow our team acquires through our relationships with several hundred hedge fund investors who invest with emerging managers, and share that knowledge with our clients as we consult about introductions.
Benefit to Allocators
We believe we are in somewhat of a unique position as we serve a large number of managers through our prime brokerage unit and have a great degree of transparency into their performance and risk characteristics. We also have an opportunity to review a number of emerging and established managers on a regular basis who are introduced by our prime brokerage sales team or seek us out to potentially provide specific services.


Targeted Introductions
Our team maintains a regular dialog with the firm’s allocator contacts and works to gain insights about their experience with managers and the needs they need to fill. Armed with such information, we set out to search for managers whose strategies and return profiles match these needs from among the managers in our database, and arrange for one-on-one meetings. As part of our effort, we regularly host investor meetings at which managers have an opportunity to discuss their investment strategies and return profiles, and respond to inquiries from allocators.
Managed Account platforms
Our firm has developed strong relationships with various institutional investors who allocate sizable sums to hedge fund managers via managed accounts. As we serve these clients and their managers on a variety of levels, we are uniquely positioned to refer them to emerging managers we uncover in the regular course of business.


 

New Launch Consulting 

Our prime brokerage sales group has always functioned in a consulting capacity, helping managers to understand what’s involved in launching a fund and managing its growth. This is perhaps the most important service we can provide as it sets an appropriate expectation level with prospective clients. It also allows us to showcase our extensive knowledge of the hedge fund space and the comprehensive range of services we can offer clients. We have developed pre-launch “how to” booklets and spread sheets that managers find particularly helpful. We have helped hundreds of managers successfully launch new funds over the years, and remain available throughout the relationship to provide advice on growth options, new hires, seed investor opportunities, and other such issues that arise.

Choosing Your Prime Broker
When setting up as a new hedge fund manager, one of the most important relationships to establish is that of the prime broker. With banks facing regulatory pressures in the form of Basel 3, many are re-appraising their client book to ensure that they are getting a suitable return on investment for the balance sheet they provide. Consequently, the first point for start-ups to focus on is to articulate what they will be doing with the fund they are planning to launch.

Biotech – Cowen Analysis: When Insiders Buy, Investors Should Too
Cowen analyzed 4K+ open market transactions made by insiders at the 10 largest biotechnology companies over the last 10 years. We find that purchases by insiders are a strong predictor of outperformance, while stock sales by insiders have little predictive value. When insiders purchase shares of fundamentally strong companies, a successful strategy would seem to be to buy right along with them.
