 Obituary			



 Service Details
			







Daniel J. Karas, 56, died of natural causes on Sunday, April 24, 2016, in his home in Tallahassee, FL.
Born in Sewickley, at an early age, he and his family moved from Ambridge, to Cocoa Beach, FL and later settled in Merritt Island, FL. He graduated from Merritt Island High School and studied computer science and related subjects at the University of Florida, Herzing College and the University of Phoenix.
Dan was an extraordinary computer and information technology expert who lent his talents to such noted organizations as the University of South Florida and Wyle Laboratories at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).
He worked at KSC in the early days of the space shuttle, where he began his career retrofitting and re-engineering the shuttles protective heat tiles for orbit re-entry. He became a certified Microsoft software programmer and advanced his career at KSC by assuming computer programming duties there. Since 2007, he was a senior software developer at Windermere Professionals, LLC, his own independent consulting firm.
An avid outdoorsman, he enjoyed camping, rock climbing, cave exploration, scuba diving, downhill skiing, fishing and marksmanship activities. He was a voracious reader and enjoyed music. Always unassuming with a quirky wit and never one to flaunt or brag about his technical expertise, his professional credo was "When you do things right, you can be certain that some people think you do nothing at all."
Surviving are his parents, John and Joanne Karas; two sisters, Christine Karas (Steve McGrath) and Amy (Kevin) Lane; three nephews, Nicholas Lane, Patrick and Ian McGrath and a niece, Audrey Lane, as well as numerous aunts, uncles and cousins.
A funeral service will be held at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, May 4, 2016, at Holy Ghost Orthodox Church in Ambridge. Interment will follow in Economy Cemetery.
Dan was a kind and loving son, brother, nephew, and uncle who greatly enjoyed being part of family get-togethers and will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved him.
If desired, donations, in Dan's memory may be sent to the building fund at St. Anthony Orthodox Church, P.O. Box 267, Melbourne, FL 32902, where he had been a devout member for many years.
Arrangements are entrusted to the JOHN SYKA FUNERAL HOME INC., 833 Kennedy Drive, Ambridge.
