Description

                    Grouse - an ecologically important group of birds that include capercaillie, prairie chickens, and ptarmigan - are distributed throughout the forests, grasslands, and tundra of Europe, Asia, and North America. Today, many grouse populations are in decline, and the conservation and management of these charismatic birds is becoming a global concern. This volume summarizes current knowledge of grouse biology in 25 chapters contributed by 80 researchers from field studies around the world. Organized in four sections - Spatial Ecology, Habitat Relationships, Population Biology, and Conservation and Management - the chapters offer important insights into spatial requirements, movements, and demography of grouse. Much of the research employs emerging tools in ecology that span biogeochemistry, molecular genetics, endocrinology, radio-telemetry, and remote sensing. The chapters explore topics including the impacts of climate change, energy development, and harvest, and give new evidence for life-history changes in response to human activities.show more

Review quote

                            "As this volume demonstrates, grouse remain ideal research subjects to explore a wide variety of topics important to ornithologists." Wilson Journal Of Ornithology "[This] new volume summarizes current knowledge of grouse biology from field studies around the world." Environment Canada "Full of the detail." -- G. R. Potts Ibisshow more



Flap copy

                            The grouse of the northern hemisphere have been bellwether agents for population ecology and conservation. This book will help bring our knowledge of these birds together both to increase our ecological understanding of grouse and to improve our conservation efforts for these birds. --Charles J. Krebs, Professor Emeritus of Zoology, University of British Columbia 
"A marvelous feast of field studies, especially for researchers working with dwindling and threatened populations, focusing on habitat relationships and population biology. This book is a sumptuous meal for avian researchers. --Paul Johnsgard, Professor Emeritus, University of Nebraska-Lincoln and author of Grassland Grouse and their Conservation 
"This volume is exciting from the perspective of a grouse biologist but also from a more general ecological perspective. It provides an excellent synthesis of the ecology and conservation of these fascinating and beautiful inhabitants and their ecosystems, which are as diverse as tundra, forest, and grassland."--Hans Christian Pedersen, Professor and Senior Scientist, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research.

Winder, Virginia; Gregory, Andrew; McNew, Lance; and Sandercock, BrettResponses of male Greater Prairie-Chickens to wind energy development ~ ABSTRACT Renewable energy resources have received increased attention because of impacts of fossil fuels on global climate change. In Kansas, USA, optimal sites for wind energy development often overlap with preferred habitats of the Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido), a lek-mating prairie grouse of conservation concern. We tested for potential effects of energy development on male Greater Prairie-Chickens in north-central Kansas. We captured males at 23 leks located 0.04 to 28 km from wind turbines during a 2-yr preconstruction period (2007–2008) . . .Also try:
