History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.

History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.
In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.[12]

An SFC investigation found that from Dec. 1, 2008 to June 30, 2013, SSGA deposited the tracker fund's cash balances with its affliate State Street Bank and Trust Company's (SSBT), which offered zero interest on Hong Kong dollars even though the prevailing commercial interest rates were higher than this at the time. The SFC said SSGA had failed in its obligation to ensure the fund received interest in line with the market rate, and also found the company had poor procedures for handling the internal conflict of interest that led SSGA Asia to deposit the funds with its affiliate SSBT. SSGA also failed to fully disclose the situation in six interim and annual reports. The SFC said that SSGA had fully cooperated with its investigation, and had agreed to review its controls, and had compensated the fund concerned.

They attempt first contact via email from a public domain or via a text message.
They attempt to perform an online interview via common web services.
They may impersonate State Street or SSGA individuals during the process.
They may send a check and ask for the funds to be deposited and wired to another location for the purchase of home office equipment.
They may use the State Street or SSGA trademark and logo in the process.

If you have been contacted under these circumstances please report the activity to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, which is a partnership among the Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI), the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BIA), at www.ic3.gov.

MAKING SMART BETA WORK FOR YOU
In the struggle for returns, the question around smart beta is no longer “should we?” but “how do we?” Making decisions about factor selection, timing and other considerations can be challenging.
                    

                    We hope this information helps illustrate how to put smart beta into practice. And we’re here to help craft a custom solution that fits your needs.

Selecting Factors


FACTORS: THE ESSENCE OF SMART BETA


Target single factors or multi-factor combinations to meet your portfolio objectives. The selection of a specific smart beta approach will depend on your unique investment objectives.


Smart beta strategies harness the power of factors that active managers commonly seek exposure to, while preserving the benefits of traditional passive approaches.






Value






Value




Value stocks are those that trade at a lower price than their fundamentals (earnings, sales, etc.) would imply. Over the long term, low valuation stocks have outperformed 1 high valuation (expensive) names. 2








Size






Size




Smaller capitalization companies have tended to outperform larger capitalization companies over the long term.1








Volatility






Volatility




Creating a portfolio with lower volatility or tilting towards lower risk stocks can likely generate a higher risk-adjusted return than traditional financial theory would suggest.








Quality






Quality




Out of all the factors, quality has perhaps the clearest economic intuition. It makes sense that higher quality companies are rewarded with better returns over the longer term because they are better at deploying capital and generating wealth.1








Momentum






Momentum




Stocks that have done well recently tend to carry on doing well in the near term. By gaining more exposure to stocks that have done well, you can benefit from the momentum premium.1

Extending to fixed income



As yields continue to decline and investors move deeper into credit markets to achieve their goals, quality tilted Fixed Income smart beta strategies are gaining in popularity.


Our strategies focus on extracting value/quality factor premia from both sovereign and corporate credit:





Sovereign credit

A combined factor approach that tilts towards higher quality Sovereigns with an embedded volatility trigger to capture market confidence.




Corporate credit

A combined factor approach that tilts towards issuers where the compensation (value) for default risk (quality) is attractive.









Case Studies


SMART BETA IN ACTION


Institutional Investors See the Difference:  In our recent survey, 76% of those implementing smart beta reported moderate-to-significant improvement in meeting their long-term aims*.


See how your peers are solving their challenges with smart beta.





Enhance Index Exposure




Case study

CHALLENGE
An investor with a US$2.3 billion portfolio invested in a passive S&P 500 Index strategy wanted to remain passive but achieve better risk-adjusted returns.



SOLUTION
Reduce risk and improve return by mixing passive and smart beta strategies. The investor wished to capture value and low volatility factor premia with its smart beta allocations.






Results
INCREASED HISTORICAL RETURNS,REDUCED HISTORICAL VOLATILITY





Improve Return Potential




Case study

CHALLENGE
A UK-based defined benefit pension scheme was seeking ways to improve the return potential of their traditional market cap equity portfolio. The investor was cognizant of the current strategy’s limitations and its vulnerability to large exposures to highly-valued sectors and stocks.


SOLUTION
The client chose SSGA’s multi-factor smart beta strategy consisting of value, quality and volatility factors to improve risk-adjusted returns and diversification of its core passive allocation. The client decided this was a more cost-effective and transparent solution that required relatively low governance when compared to a traditional active portfolio.

COST-EFFICIENT DIVERSIFICATION





Seek Better Outcomes for Matched Portfolios




Case study

CHALLENGE
A US defined benefit fund wanted to improve its fixed income performance relative to liabilities without jeopardizing funding status. The client wanted to extract the quality premium from credit while maintaining duration, yield, rating and maturity of the liability-driven benchmark.


SOLUTION
State Street Global Advisors worked with the client to design a factor-based solution aligned with the investor’s goal of improving return potential while continuing to match assets and liabilities. The approach tilted towards higher quality (measured by default risk), adjusted for value. Ultimately the quality-tilted solution delivered

FUNDING PRESERVED, BETTER RETURNS





Avoid Overdiversifying Active Exposure




Case study

CHALLENGE


                                A US non-profit with assets invested by a number of active managers asked SSGA to conduct a risk-based analysis of its public equity portfolio to understand the drivers of active return. Portfolios that use multiple active strategies may suffer from over-diversification, with managers’ particular styles cancelling each other out
                                
Our analysis showed:

the overall active risk of the aggregate portfolio was low
high exposure to volatile equities and negative exposure to value, meaning the portfolio favoured expensive stocks.





SOLUTION

Re-allocate a portion of the active portfolio to smart beta strategies that provide certain desirable factor exposures that may not be reflected in the portfolio of active managers, such as value and low volatility.
                                    

                                    Design allows for potentially higher active risk, greater flexibility, more control and simplicity.

FOCUSED EXPOSURES, REDUCED FEES





Long-term Return Targeting across Market Cycles




Case study

CHALLENGE
As part of a portfolio review, a manager of DC plans sought options to help achieve specific factor exposure to improve returns over the long term.



SOLUTION
Recognizing that market timing is notoriously difficult, we helped build a solution providing exposure to three underlying traditional factors instead of one. Our client appreciates that the multi-factor strategy permits them to take simple factor exposures — the simplicity and transparency of SSGA’s methodology in building the factor was a key attraction. As an early adopter of the multi-factor approach, our client has since expressed interest in pursuing a similar strategy for its Emerging Market equity exposure in partnership with State Street Global Advisors.

CAN THE WHOLE BE MORE THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS?
BOTTOM-UP TOP-DOWN MULTI-FACTOR PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
By Jennifer Bender and Taie Wang
Journal of Portfolio Management, Special Issue 2016

                                Is it better to combine single-factor portfolios or to build a multi-factor portfolio from the security level? This study examined both approaches and showed that a bottom-up approach produced different and sometimes superior results than combining individual single-factor portfolios.

It should not be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security. It does not take into account any investor’s particular investment objectives, strategies, tax status or investment horizon. You should consult your tax and financial advisor. All material has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable. There is no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the information and State Street shall have no liability for decisions based on such information. Value stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole. They can remain undervalued by the market for long periods of time. Low volatility funds can exhibit relative low volatility and excess returns compared to the Index over the long term; both portfolio investments and returns may differ from those of the Index. The fund may not experience lower volatility or provide returns in excess of the Index and may provide lower returns in periods of a rapidly rising market. Active stock selection may lead to added risk in exchange for the potential outperformance relative to the Index. Government bonds and corporate bonds generally have more moderate short-term price fluctuations than stocks, but provide lower potential long-term returns. Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss. While diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss, investors in smart beta may diversify across a mix of factors to address cyclical changes in factor performance. However, factors may have high or increasing correlation. All the index performance results referred to are provided exclusively for comparison purposes only. It should not be assumed that they represent the performance of any particular investment. A smart beta strategy does not seek to replicate the performance of a specified cap-weighted index and as such may underperform such an index. The factors to which a smart beta strategy seeks to deliver exposure may themselves undergo cyclical performance. As such, a smart beta strategy may underperform the market or other smart beta strategies exposed to similar or other targeted factors. In fact, we believe that factor premia accrue over the long term (5-10 years), and investors must keep that long time horizon in mind when investing.

History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.
In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.[12]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
