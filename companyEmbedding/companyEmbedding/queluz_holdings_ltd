Item 3 is amended and restated by the following:
 
Changes in beneficial ownership of the Shares covered by the Schedule 13D have occurred since the date of the filing of Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule 13D on February 25, 2010. During the period from March 8, 2010 to June 8, 2010, CFV19 sold 150,000 Shares and MSAL sold 726,250 Shares in a series of open market transactions. This Amendment No. 2 to the Schedule 13D is being filed to disclose changes in the beneficial ownership of Shares by Mr. Mello, and to disclose Mr. Mello’s entry into an agreement on August 25, 2010 (the “Agreement”) with Shell Brazil Holding B.V. (“Shell”) and Shell Overseas Holdings Limited concerning the Shares and other matters.
 
Item 4. Purpose of Transaction
 
Item 4 is amended by the addition of the following:
 
Changes in beneficial ownership of the Shares covered by the Schedule 13D have occurred since the date of the filing of Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule 13D on February 25, 2010. During the period from March 8, 2010 to June 8, 2010, CFV19 sold 150,000 Shares and MSAL sold 726,250 Shares in a series of open market transactions.
 
In connection with Mr. Mello’s entry into the Agreement, on August 25, 2010, the Issuer entered into a framework agreement (the “Framework Agreement”) between Cosan S.A. Indústria e Comércio (“Cosan”), Cosan Distribuidora de Combustíveis Ltda., Houches Holdings S.A., Shell, Shell Brasil Limitada, Shell Overseas Holdings Limited and Milimétrica Participações S.A., pursuant to which the parties to the Framework Agreement have agreed to form a proposed joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) that will produce sugar, ethanol and power as well as engage in the supply, distribution and sale of fuels.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Mr. Mello has agreed to and covenants to Shell that he will exercise the votes which he controls (i) at shareholder meetings of the Issuer and Cosan and (ii) at meetings of the board of the Issuer and Cosan (in each case to the extent consistent with his fiduciary duties) and to use his influence with the other members of the boards (in each case to the extent consistent with his or the board member’s fiduciary duties) to vote:
 




  


·


to ensure that for the period from August 25, 2010 until the fourth anniversary of the closing under the Framework Agreement (the “Closing”) Cosan retains its controlling interest in Rumo Logistica S.A. (“Rumo”), and if Cosan transfers any of its interests in Rumo or receives proceeds from an initial public offering, private placement or issuance of debt or new shares in Rumo, such proceeds are retained by Cosan and not distributed to its shareholders until the fourth anniversary of the Closing;



 




  


·


to ensure that the Issuer will not participate in any tender offer in any shares in Cosan;



 




  


·


against any resolution that if passed would result in a breach of the Framework Agreement or any of the other agreements contemplated in the Framework Agreement;



 




  


·


in favor of any resolution that if passed would result in the approval of any of the other agreements contemplated in the Framework Agreement;



 




  


·


to ensure that any proceeds paid to the Issuer and/or Cosan by (i) a third party in connection with the sale of all of the Issuer’s interest in Cosan or all of Cosan’s interest in the Joint Venture or (ii) Shell in 




 


  


Page 7 of 17





  


 




  


 


connection with its purchase of all or part of Cosan’s interest in the Joint Venture are retained by the Issuer and/or Cosan for a period of nine months from the completion of such sale, subject to certain specified exceptions;



 





  


·


to ensure that after the lapse of the nine-month period described above, any proceeds from a sale are distributed ratably among the shareholders of the Issuer and/or Cosan; and



 




  


·


to ensure that Cosan continues to conduct active business and operations after the Closing.



 
Mr. Mello has also agreed to limitations, subject to certain specified exceptions, on his ability to transfer his controlling interest in the Shares and his direct and indirect interests in the Joint Venture during certain specified periods, including the period from the Closing until the sixth anniversary of the Closing. In connection with the sale of Mr. Mello’s direct or indirect controlling interest in the Joint Venture to a third party during certain specified time periods, Shell has a right of first refusal.  Additionally, Mr. Mello has agreed to certain specified limitations on reorganizations, mergers and business combinations of and involving the Issuer and/or Cosan.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1 to this Schedule 13D  and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Mr. Mello is the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of the Issuer and the controlling shareholder of the Reporting Persons. Each of the Shares entitles its holder to one vote. Each of the Issuer’s shares of class B common stock entitles its holder to ten votes. Mr. Mello controls 41.2% of the Issuer’s issued and outstanding share capital, and 86.1% of the Issuer’s voting power by virtue of his beneficial ownership and control of 100% of the Issuer’s class B common shares and 8.7% of the Issuer’s class A common shares.
