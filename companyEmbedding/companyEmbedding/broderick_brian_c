Brian Broderick’s Comment on Trusts and Estates Planning
“My objective is to help people make sensible decisions about their personal and business planning affairs through the exercise of sound judgment and practical experience. The intersections of tax, corporate, and property law are confounding. There is sometimes a default decision-making process that seeks safety in form rather than a more rigorous evaluation of substance.”
