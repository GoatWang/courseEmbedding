Our grill is new and we have had no problems with other Blue Rhino gas tanks. I hooked up the tank per instructions and turned on the regulator. At that time, you could audibly hear gas expelling between the grill regulator and the tank regulator. We discontinued use and turned off the gas and returned the tank to the store for a replacement.

After several accusations from store personnel that they have never seen that before and initial refusal to return the tank, my wife obtained a replacement (after 30 minutes and obvious frustration). She went home and installed the new tank and everything is working as it should.

My wife was simply returning a tank that had an obvious safety issue and could have resulted in property damage, personal injury, or death if use would have continued. This should have been exchanged with no questions asked. We are loyal customers to your products and wanted to tell you about a negative experience with a retailer of your products.

What if this happens in the future then someone takes it home thinking the store said it was safe then they are injured or killed? This is 100% unacceptable!Was this review helpful?Yes (22)No (5)ReportOld tanks stocked. Excange tanks are poor value.4/28/2016Average rating:1out of5stars, based onreviews4/28/2016by SupernovaburnIf you ever plan to get a refill at a service station be sure to check the date stamp on the tank. Most of the tanks I saw at the store had 1999-2005 date stamps. Tanks can't be refilled after 12 years by per law unless re-certified. Make sure your date stamp is at least from somewhere around 2010. That will get you a few years use out of it with refills. I got lucky and found 1 tank with a 2013 stamp. I will be able to have it refilled until 2025 without re-certification.
Reason refills are important"? Exchange tanks come with 15lbs (~3.5 gal) of propane.
3.5gal of propane would cost $7 at my local gas station. Tanks hold up to 4.7gal also. So exchange tanks are only 75% full.
Moral of this story. Exchange tanks are only good if you need to get rid of an old tank, or you need fuel right now.Was this review helpful?Yes (104)No (13)ReportWatch out !3/10/2016Average rating:2out of5stars, based onreviews3/10/2016by prepuurBlue Rhino in their exchange program may have had a prior customer turn in an outdated tank. They will then recertify a tank if it passes their inspection process. The problem is, what happens if a returned tank hasn't quite reached the expiration date? Well, they refill it and you get a "soon to expire" tank. If it takes you a year or so to use up the propane, then you try and obtain a REFILL instead of an exchange, you'll be turned away. So imagine the hassle if you're on a camping trip & no one will refill the 20lb bottle ! It was explained to me that this activity from Blue Rhino is a strategy to reel the customer back into THEIR exchange program ! So if you buy from them, look at the latest certification date, if it isn't long enough, ask for another one until you're satisfied with the time period...Was this review helpful?Yes (83)No (13)ReportGood stuff4/15/2017Average rating:5out of5stars, based onreviews4/15/2017by GeorgeI exchanged a propane tank that was was in terrible shape, all rusty and beat up, and got a full one for under $16, including taxes.Was this review helpful?Yes (25)No (8)ReportHigh priced propane3/12/2016Average rating:1out of5stars, based onreviews3/12/2016by You will get about 4 gallons of propane for 16 bucks. That's 4 dollars a gallon. Most gas stations or hardware stores will fill your tank for $2/gallon or less, (in my area anyways) total $8. Probably save time too. This is no bargain.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Product Overview





			            Is it getting hot over here, or is that just us. AmeriGas Propane Exchange is the quick, easy way for you to swap out a tank, or buy a spare. Available at over 48,000 locations nationwide, there is always a local place to get propane you can trust, and get on with your day. With safety being our number one priority, the chemical properties of propane restrict us to only fill our tanks to 80% capacity. Our main concern is the variable expansion ratio of the liquid within the container over a temperature rise. By not filling to 100%, a vapor space is created within the container. This allows room for liquid expansion, should it occur, and allows vaporization of the liquid propane to occur unimpeded.

            What size is the tank? 5,10,15,20?
        

            What size is the tank? 5,10,15,20?
        
Asked by: Learning

            Even though they are filled to 15 lb , they can be filled to 20 lb. There was a lawsuit on some gas resellers a few years ago.

            Can I be picky in choosing which tank I grab in exchange for the one I brought to the store to ensure is good condition?
        


Asked by: Anon

            You can absolutely be picky when selecting your AmeriGas tank. We take pride in our production of cylinders to recycle or re-certify our expired tanks to make sure every tank is in up-to-date condition and ready for your grill! If you are talking about the condition in appearance of the tank, that is your personal preference.

Hope that helps!

            Can an AmeriGas tank be refilled?
        

            Can this tank be refilled at a propane filling station elsewhere?
        
Asked by: sallyn

            Yes, our tanks can be refilled. If you choose to refill your AmeriGas tank, please know the expiration date on the tank. When that date comes we suggest you take it to your local Home Depot and exchange it for a new certified tank.

Starting off this is a convince product, need gas in a hurry don't want to deal with filling a bottle or after hours when filling stations are closed this product fits the bill. 

Up sides, quick swap, after normal hour exchange Depending on your HD hours. Exchange bottle can be out of date bottle. That is when you get your tank filled and they tell you they can't because it's out of testing , or you have an old style filler valve basically a useless bottle to the consumer you can use this bottle for an exchange. If your diligent check the bottle your being given to be sure it's in compliance with your laws. You now have a bottle that can be filled . 
Down side. For the convince of time and energy you'll pay more then filling it yourself. Tank exchange if your exchanging a better bottle then your getting in return. Do,your diligence to be sure your getting a newer bottle then old. This by date stamped and looking at the valve condition. 

In viewing other complaint on this product, valves leaking , Check your side of the regulator most leaks are from the regulator to your product. If the bottle is at max level when you pick it up , it has probably been sitting At HD for at least a few days and would have already leaked down. Turn off the bottle valve after every use and I bet the volume stays the same in the bottle. As for quantity reced, yes it's possible,to get a lower volume bottle but chances are high you are getting what is advertised. Distribution equipment is regulated by weights and measures and mechanically filled. Error is pretty slim unless the bottle or valve has a leak. Have HD weight the bottel before you take it if you are suspect it is not filled to spec. You are purchasing 15 lbs of propane net weight that is 4.7 gallons. Lastly if you really think you have been under sold before you use it , return it to HD, if you really think you have been defrauded file a complaint to weights and measures in your area. 99.9% of the time you will be wrong. 
Remember convince, quality, quantity , price.

        Worst
I would caution anyone from doing an exchange. I was stupid enough to do an exchange with a brand new tank I bought off HD. Received a beat up tank, connected it to the regulator and it is hissing and leaking gas at the valve. Now I am out of my brand new tank for a beat up leaking tank. I don’t even want to exchange it for another one. I think the best route is getting a brand new tank and having it filled at a propane service station.
I am guessing people use this exchange to ditch their aged, expired beat up tanks for a “conditioned” tank. Unfortunately it looks like they don’t condition and leak test these beat up tanks well enough. 
I hope I can get my brand new tank back from them.

Be aware that the 20 lb propane exchange tanks are only 3/4 full. They don't show it on the website but their 20 lb tanks only have 15 lbs of propane in them and they cost more than a full refill elsewhere. Most people would not notice this, just another reason to shop at a smaller local business.

        It is NOT self service
I have always known that the Amerigas exchange was expensive but its real appeal to me is that it used to be completely self-service. I just went to exchange a tank only to find that you have to pay inside instead of at the kiosk outside. The whole reason I drove by a number of other places at which I can exchange tanks is that I didn't want to wait or deal with a cashier. Either offer the service or don't.

You pay extra for convenience, and get less fuel, compared to having your own tank filled. A '20 lb' tank would hold 25 lb if filled to the top, and 80% of that is 20 lb. The marketing blurb on this site is deceptive. If you don't believe it, take the 'WC' (water capacity) figure stamped on the ring, which is the weight of water it would hold if filled to the top, multiply by .52 (just over half the density of water), and again by 0.8 (80% fill limit), and you'll get ~20 lb. Add the 'TW' (tare weight) figure that's stamped on the ring, which is the empty tank weight, and you can see how much is actually in there. Pressure depends only on temperature, so a pressure gauge on a stored tank is useless, by the way.

        Waste of Money
I had three different tanks from Amerigas. The are garbage. The valves on all three leaked so I lost most of the propane. Do yourself a favor and buy a new tank and just pay to have it filled. You will save money and frustration. Most of these tanks are very old.

        Here are the facts
Here are the facts:

A "20# cylinder" is called that because that is its "maximum safe capacity". That is the most propane it can safely contain. This accounts for the 20% gas space which allows for expansion.

One gallon of propane weighs 4.24#.

Therefore, a 20# cylinder filled to "maximum safe capacity" will contain (20# / 4.24gal/#) = 4.7 gallons of propane. 

If you take a propane tank to a service station and fill it "all the way", you will leave with 4.7 gallons in your tank, because they will not fill the tank beyond its "maximum safe capacity". At this point, the tank is "full".

A typical empty "20# cylinder" weighs around 17#.

Therefore, a "full 20# cylinder" weighs around (17# + 20#) = 37#.

This Amerigas cylinder weighs 32#.

Therefore, this Amerigas cylinder gives you (32# - 17#) = 15# of propane.

Given that a "full" cylinder can hold 20# of propane, and the Amerigas cylinder gives you 15#, the Amerigas cylinder is being sold at (15# / 20#) = 75% "full".

        1/2 filled tanks
I exchanged a tank because it was out of date. Hooked it up to a portable heater and it ran out within an hour. THey clam they fill them to 15#. If you take them to go filled else wear they will fill them to 20#. If your tank is not out of date refill do not exchange!!!
