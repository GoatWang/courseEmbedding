Texas technopark: TechnipFMC John T. Gremp Campus



 




 Silver Award: TechnipFMC’s new campus marks the start of a massive planned community in north Houston.
 
 Building Team Awards | 
 June 12, 2017 | 
 Robert Cassidy, Executive Editor
 
 
In addition to BIM modeling, the Building Team used a COBiE-based Integrated Workplace Management System usually reserved for government projects.

 
 The 173-acre TechnipFMC John T. Gremp Campus is the first element in north Houston’s Generation Park planned community. The 1.7 million-sf complex was completed in March 2016. Two months later, FMC Technologies and European oil and gas equipment technology company Technip formally announced their merger.
The new campus consolidates manufacturing, offices, and amenities for thousands of employees who were spread across six locations in the Houston area.
The Building Team, led by design giant Gensler, developer Trammell Crow, and contractor D.E. Harvey Builders, successfully dealt with requests from the owner after work had already begun.
First, TechnipFMC wanted to change two primary office buildings that were connected at only one level into a single building that would be connected on all levels. The project team used 3D visualization for fast design approval to insert a multi-level vertical connector into shared amenity space on each level.
Next, the owner added a new sophisticated process equipment product line to the project scope very late in the design process. The Building Team created a new design that allowed for placement of an in-ground rail system, underground utility distribution system, and automated welding machine system; all this, after most of the structure was already built.
TechnipFMC then announced that it was developing a new subsea equipment system that was significantly larger and heavier than the original building was designed for. The Building Team modified floor thicknesses, added 50 tons to the crane capacity, revised equipment circulation, and increased the size of the testing area without affecting foundation pours that were already in progress.
