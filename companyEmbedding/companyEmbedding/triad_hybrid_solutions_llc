 Triad Advisors Launches Triad Hybrid Solutions Providing Benefits of RIA Firm Ownership for 
         










    










 






 











 









Triad Advisors Launches Triad Hybrid Solutions Providing Benefits of RIA Firm Ownership for Independent Advisors, Without the Same Regulatory Complexity and Costs

		  New Platform Provides Streamlined Regulatory and Compliance Processes, Scalable Growth Tools, and Multi-Custodial Experience to Independent Fee- and Commission-Based Advisors
		

Aug 19, 2014, 09:15 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Triad Advisors, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


ATLANTA, Aug. 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Triad Advisors, Inc. today announced the launch of Triad Hybrid Solutions, a new Registered Investment Advisory (RIA) entity serving fee- and commission-based independent financial advisors.  As part of this announcement, the company stated that Michael C. Bryan, Senior Vice President, Advisory Services, will serve as CEO of Triad Hybrid Solutions.
The new RIA primarily targets comparatively small to mid-sized independent advisors seeking the most advantageous attributes of owning their own RIA firms while offloading growing regulatory complexity and costs to a proven industry expert. In addition, Triad Hybrid Solutions offers IARs the maximum flexibility of custodial partners typically associated only with RIA firm ownership.  Triad Hybrid Solutions will enable its affiliated independent advisors to utilize multiple leading custodians including Charles Schwab & Co., Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services, and National Financial Services, LLC.  Further custodial partnerships with top providers are anticipated later this year.
Triad Hybrid Solutions expects to attract investment advisors of RIAs that deal with multiple state registrations, those who do not have the desire to dedicate staff and resources to RIA maintenance, or breakaways from wirehouses who may prefer an established structure. The association with Triad's well-known broker/dealer also gives financial professionals the ability to offer products and services in a true hybrid business model serving clients on either a fee or commission basis.
Additionally, Triad Hybrid Solutions will offer the benefits of customized, end-to-end practice management support through industry-leading third party providers, all delivered at a cost that smaller RIA firms would be unlikely to afford.  This includes top-of-the-line resources such as Advent Software's Black Diamond portfolio management and performance reporting technology as well as Salesforce.com's customer relationship management (CRM) solutions.
Michael C. Bryan, Senior Vice President, Advisory Services, said, "Triad Hybrid Solutions meets a rapidly growing demand among an overlooked yet sizable segment of the independent advisor population. Advisors can leverage our extensive experience in the hybrid space, access industry-leading tools, and take comfort in knowing we manage the significant challenges of compliance and regulatory changes. Advisors are free to grow their own businesses with confidence."
Nathan M. Stibbs, Senior Vice President, National Business Development, said, "For years, Triad Advisors has been a pioneer in providing hybrid independent fee- and commission-based financial advisors with the most accommodating structures for successfully pursuing their individual business models. The rollout of Triad Hybrid Solutions presents an important new offering in the broad range of our capabilities and reinforces our well-established leadership position in the industry." 
About Triad Advisors: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Triad Advisors, Inc. is a national, independent broker-dealer and multi-custodial SEC-Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) that is an early pioneer and continued leader in the Hybrid RIA marketplace.  The company provides a comprehensive platform of products, trading and technology systems, as well as customized wealth management and practice management solutions to over 550 advisors nationwide, the majority of whom operate their own Hybrid RIA firms.  Recognized as one of the most successful and fastest growing independent broker-dealers in the industry (including being named the leading broker-dealer for Hybrid RIAs from 2009-2012 by Investment Advisor Magazine), the company was created expressly around the vision that independent financial advisors are best served when they are empowered with the capability to seamlessly integrate fee and commission-based services for their end clients.  Triad Advisors is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE MKT: LTS). For more information, please visit www.triad-advisors.com.

Triad Advisors
Services & Support




Fee-Based Flexibility
At Triad Hybrid Solutions, a robust menu of services and solutions is available. You have the ability to provide written financial plans, investment management strategies (advisor-directed or third party), insurance solutions, and retirement plan advice to your clients. Our consultants ensure you have a clear understanding of your options so you can make informed decisions about the solutions you would most like to leverage.






Financial Planning

Hybrid Solutions offers multiple financial planning software options, a client-ready planning agreement, and an expedited (48 hour or less) review process to ensure you deliver a high quality product to your clients.



Investment Management

For the advisor whose value proposition includes the creation of investment portfolios, Triad Hybrid Solutions offers two account structures: Counsel and Ally. Counsel is an asset-based or "wrap" structure while Ally allows an advisor a fee plus transaction charge structure. The client and you determine the best option.  Advisors may choose to manage client assets on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. You may utilize individual securities, ETFs, mutual funds or approved UITs, options or "alternatives."
For advisors who choose to leverage professional expertise for investment research, portfolio construction, and trade execution, Triad Hybrid Solutions offers an extensive menu of third party strategists. Advisors may use separately managed accounts, a unified managed account or mutual fund and ETF portfolio models. In addition, we give access to a true end-to-end platform that provides portfolio analytics, proposal generation, research and comparative analysis of managers.



Variable Annuity Management

Hybrid Solutions has partnered with outstanding fee-based solutions in the variable annuity space including Jefferson National, Nationwide, and Prudential. Declining expenses, multiple subaccount choices, rider availability and no CDSCs make these no-load offerings a viable way to avoid conflicting compensation messaging that can occur when selling VAs on a commission basis to an otherwise fee-based client.



Retirement Plan Advice

Advisors who have recognized the opportunity and developed an expertise in the retirement plan space can utilize the agreements and partners of Hybrid Solutions to offer plan sponsors fiduciary services on a fee basis.








Best-in-Breed Technology
We dedicate resources to continuous industry evaluation and leveraging economies of scale to bring together a forward-thinking, flexible and sophisticated technology platform. Our integrated platform includes the most adaptable client relationship management (CRM) system, portfolio analytics, consolidated and performance reporting, and block and model trading functionality. Perhaps most importantly, we offer a single point of support for the technology we provide. You won’t bounce around phone trees or changing staff on "regional teams."





CRM System


Portfolio Analytics


Consolidated& PerformanceReporting


Block & Model Trading







Salesforce, the most flexible CRM system available, is the backbone of a system that acts more as an office assistant than an electronic rolodex. Embedded work flows provide simplified account establishment processes and documentation.





Black Diamond, a leader in portfolio analytics, allows you to slice and dice your book of business, a segment, a household, or an account to give a deep dive look into what’s happening within managed accounts. In addition, performance reporting is available for all accounts. Combine the sophisticated performance metrics with investor-friendly functionality to help educate clients about their progress toward their goals. A host of report templates, as well as customization options, are available so you may present account information to clients in a way that best meets their sophistication and curiosity. Black Diamond handles daily reconciliation of positions and balances, taking the work off your shoulders.
For those advisors taking on the asset management functions, Black Diamond presents block trading, model and rebalancing functionality. In addition, you may choose to leverage the trading platforms available through our custodial partners.






Back Office Expertise
Our team is committed to timely, accurate and warm responses to your inquiries. We host training on a regular basis so your staff can stay up-to-date on procedures and best practices. We believe your back office experience should be a genuine pleasure, not a necessary evil.


Support
Triad Hybrid Solutions functions as a single point of contact for all your operational needs. Our primary goal is to offer knowledgeable, timely, and pleasant assistance. Our team provides support for account establishment and maintenance and acts as your conduit to the custodial partners. Additionally, we handle the entire fee billing and debiting process. We calculate the fee, debit client accounts and provide fee reports for your review.


Process
Work flows within Salesforce will assist with operational processes including account establishment and maintenance items. Integration with tools such as LaserApp ensures paperwork is as accurate and complete as possible when you meet with clients. 






Compliance

Triad Hybrid Solutions is an SEC Registered Investment Adviser providing your Investment Advisor Agreements, Compliance Manual, ADV, and Policies and Procedures. We ensure you are aware of and are able to meet reporting and documentation requirements. Our team of experts is available for consultation at any time and takes a common sense approach to industry regulations. Rather than working with a rigid "no" department, we take time to understand your need and work with you to help accomplish your goals within the framework of regulations, laws, and reasonable policies.

Triad Advisors
Confidence Wherever You Grow



Triad Hybrid Solutions is a Registered Investment Advisor firm offering the best features of an independent advice model. We provide expert consultative guidance, knowledgeable operational and compliance support, and advanced technology tools. Our solutions maximize efficiencies and foster growth.




Support for the Growing Independent Financial Advisor

Triad Hybrid Solutions is a Registered Investment Advisor firm providing the best features of an independent advice model, expert consultative and operational support, and advanced technology tools to improve efficiencies and foster growth. While we offer a flexible and proven back office RIA platform, we believe developing a strong relationship with advisors, one that gives us a true understanding of their vision, is the best way to build a sustainable and enjoyable business. 
In our ever-changing world of complex regulations and rapidly evolving technology, the management of an independent RIA entity is costly and distracts from client service and business growth. You must have confidence that you are meeting changing regulatory requirements and that you are keeping pace with technology. How else can you efficiently grow? But doing so requires full time expertise in compliance and technical advancements.



Compliance


Operations


Consultation


Performance
    Reporting/Trading


CRM


Triad Hybrid Solutions relieves the expense and headache of regulatory navigation by offering a flexible RIA structure that allows you to provide fee-based advice in your unique way. You may create your own branding and presence in the marketplace. We also provide performance reporting, trading, analytical and CRM solutions typically only accessible to the largest producing advisors in the industry.




Triad Hybrid Solutions presents an attractive alternative for advisors considering the outsourcing of compliance and technology support of their current RIA, especially if they are operating a state, or multi-state, registered RIA. Similarly, advisors looking to make a move from a bank, wirehouse or existing RIA, but are unsure of the pros and cons of establishing and running their own RIA, may find Triad Hybrid Solutions a perfect fit.
Contact Us
Contact us today and we will happily provide  an objective evaluation of your options.




Dual Registration

Triad Hybrid Solutions was created and is led by the same individuals who pioneered the “hybrid” advisor model through Triad Advisors, Inc., an industry-leading independent Broker Dealer. Dual registrants may choose to offer both fee and commission services associated with Triad Hybrid Solutions and Triad Advisors, respectively.
Learn more about your broker dealer options.




Triad Hybrid Solutions was created with the specific intent of allowing advisors to leverage the resources and pricing advantages of the largest RIA custodial platforms in the industry.
Triad Hybrid Solutions' executives have had relationships with our custodial partners for more than 15 years. Charles Schwab Advisor Services, Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services, and TD Ameritrade Institutional put you in the most competitive position to provide investment management to your existing and new clients. Together, we support you wherever you choose to grow.


Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services
Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services delivers a custody and clearing experience, and an actionable suite of offerings, designed to help advisors on the path to a high-performing firm. 


Charles Schwab Advisor Services
Charles Schwab has built their business on serving the needs of RIAs by providing a platform of institutional-caliber products, services and tools to deliver an exceptional experience to advisors and their clients.


TD Ameritrade Institutional *
TD Ameritrade Institutional is proud to support RIAs in their passionate pursuit of excellence by providing robust educational resources, comprehensive investment choices, and powerful technology tools.



* TD Ameritrade, Inc. is one of the firms that we use to custody our client assets. TD Ameritrade, Triad Hybrid Solutions, LLC, and the other entities named are separate and unaffiliated firms, and are not responsible for each other’s services or policies.

Triad Advisors
Services & Support




Fee-Based Flexibility
At Triad Hybrid Solutions, a robust menu of services and solutions is available. You have the ability to provide written financial plans, investment management strategies (advisor-directed or third party), insurance solutions, and retirement plan advice to your clients. Our consultants ensure you have a clear understanding of your options so you can make informed decisions about the solutions you would most like to leverage.






Financial Planning

Hybrid Solutions offers multiple financial planning software options, a client-ready planning agreement, and an expedited (48 hour or less) review process to ensure you deliver a high quality product to your clients.



Investment Management

For the advisor whose value proposition includes the creation of investment portfolios, Triad Hybrid Solutions offers two account structures: Counsel and Ally. Counsel is an asset-based or "wrap" structure while Ally allows an advisor a fee plus transaction charge structure. The client and you determine the best option.  Advisors may choose to manage client assets on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. You may utilize individual securities, ETFs, mutual funds or approved UITs, options or "alternatives."
For advisors who choose to leverage professional expertise for investment research, portfolio construction, and trade execution, Triad Hybrid Solutions offers an extensive menu of third party strategists. Advisors may use separately managed accounts, a unified managed account or mutual fund and ETF portfolio models. In addition, we give access to a true end-to-end platform that provides portfolio analytics, proposal generation, research and comparative analysis of managers.



Variable Annuity Management

Hybrid Solutions has partnered with outstanding fee-based solutions in the variable annuity space including Jefferson National, Nationwide, and Prudential. Declining expenses, multiple subaccount choices, rider availability and no CDSCs make these no-load offerings a viable way to avoid conflicting compensation messaging that can occur when selling VAs on a commission basis to an otherwise fee-based client.



Retirement Plan Advice

Advisors who have recognized the opportunity and developed an expertise in the retirement plan space can utilize the agreements and partners of Hybrid Solutions to offer plan sponsors fiduciary services on a fee basis.








Best-in-Breed Technology
We dedicate resources to continuous industry evaluation and leveraging economies of scale to bring together a forward-thinking, flexible and sophisticated technology platform. Our integrated platform includes the most adaptable client relationship management (CRM) system, portfolio analytics, consolidated and performance reporting, and block and model trading functionality. Perhaps most importantly, we offer a single point of support for the technology we provide. You won’t bounce around phone trees or changing staff on "regional teams."





CRM System


Portfolio Analytics


Consolidated& PerformanceReporting


Block & Model Trading







Salesforce, the most flexible CRM system available, is the backbone of a system that acts more as an office assistant than an electronic rolodex. Embedded work flows provide simplified account establishment processes and documentation.





Black Diamond, a leader in portfolio analytics, allows you to slice and dice your book of business, a segment, a household, or an account to give a deep dive look into what’s happening within managed accounts. In addition, performance reporting is available for all accounts. Combine the sophisticated performance metrics with investor-friendly functionality to help educate clients about their progress toward their goals. A host of report templates, as well as customization options, are available so you may present account information to clients in a way that best meets their sophistication and curiosity. Black Diamond handles daily reconciliation of positions and balances, taking the work off your shoulders.
For those advisors taking on the asset management functions, Black Diamond presents block trading, model and rebalancing functionality. In addition, you may choose to leverage the trading platforms available through our custodial partners.






Back Office Expertise
Our team is committed to timely, accurate and warm responses to your inquiries. We host training on a regular basis so your staff can stay up-to-date on procedures and best practices. We believe your back office experience should be a genuine pleasure, not a necessary evil.


Support
Triad Hybrid Solutions functions as a single point of contact for all your operational needs. Our primary goal is to offer knowledgeable, timely, and pleasant assistance. Our team provides support for account establishment and maintenance and acts as your conduit to the custodial partners. Additionally, we handle the entire fee billing and debiting process. We calculate the fee, debit client accounts and provide fee reports for your review.


Process
Work flows within Salesforce will assist with operational processes including account establishment and maintenance items. Integration with tools such as LaserApp ensures paperwork is as accurate and complete as possible when you meet with clients. 






Compliance

Triad Hybrid Solutions is an SEC Registered Investment Adviser providing your Investment Advisor Agreements, Compliance Manual, ADV, and Policies and Procedures. We ensure you are aware of and are able to meet reporting and documentation requirements. Our team of experts is available for consultation at any time and takes a common sense approach to industry regulations. Rather than working with a rigid "no" department, we take time to understand your need and work with you to help accomplish your goals within the framework of regulations, laws, and reasonable policies.
