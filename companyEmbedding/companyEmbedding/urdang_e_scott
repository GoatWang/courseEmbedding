                                    1987 - 2013                


Urdang Capital Management, Inc.


                  Urdang Capital Management focuses on investments in the US real estate market. The firm's employees are organized into two teams: the Private Real Estate team and the Real Estate Debt team. Almost all of Urdang's clients follow their Private Real Estate strategy. Within the private real  market, the firm invests in value-added and core/core-plus real estate. Urdang does not offer investment vehicles in their real estate debt strategy to new clients.The firm offers investment advisory services that are customized to meet clients' individual investment goals in the form of separate accounts. They work with clients to create investment guidelines that are mutually acceptable to the client and the firm. When creating investment guidelines, clients may impose investment restrictions including limitations on the use of leverage, legal entity structures or specific property types.Urdang also offers investment advisory services to private funds including closed-end property funds, a real estate debt fund and a securitized asset fund (collateralized debt obligation or CDO). Each private fund has an investment objective and set of investment policies and/or guidelines that Urdang must follow. As such, the firm cannot tailor the investment advisory services they provide to pooled investment vehicles to meet individual investor needs. In addition, they cannot impose individual investment restrictions on their investment strategies for underlying investors in the pooled investment vehicles. The investment advisory services provided to pooled investment vehicles may be in the form of subadvisory agreements.Separate account clients and funds that follow Urdang's Private Real Estate strategy typically acquire and hold real property through a joint venture with an unaffiliated operating partner. The universe of real estate investments considered varies according to each client's objectives and market cycles and conditions. Urdang typically invests in office, industrial, retail and multi-family assets. They have also acquired performing and non-performing debt, secured by these property types, and have structured their investments as participating debt or preferred equity. Urdang also seeks to capitalize on opportunities in other property types, such as land. The firm's strategy is designed to anticipate market turning points in order to overweight or underweight property types and geographic regions. The selection of property types and geographic regions is based on the firm's top-down economic and capital markets forecasts. Urdang incorporates research on private and public capital markets, national and regional economic trends and regional real estate submarkets into analysis and decision making throughout all stages of the property investment lifecycle including acquisition, financing, leasing and disposition.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksFree 3 Credit ScoresView Your 3 Bureau Credit Scores.See Your Scores Instantly! w/ Trialwww.freescorefinder.comAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Urdang630 W Germantown Pike Ste 300Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462(610) 734-9500Real Estate ConsultantsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Summit Realty Advisor610 W Germantown PikePlymouth Meeting, PA 19462(484) 532-7830Real Estate AgentsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Summit Realty Advisors8 Devonshires CtBlue Bell, PA 19422(215) 646-9730Real Estate AgentsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. PJL Realty Advisors714 Bethlehem PikeGlenside, PA 19038(215) 402-9225Real Estate AppraisersWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Health Realty Advisors Inc75 Ridings WayAmbler, PA 19002(215) 628-0976Real Estate AgentsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. Shea Realty Advisors842 W Lancaster AveBryn Mawr, PA 19010(610) 520-2120Real Estate AppraisersWebsiteFrom Business: Shea Realty Advisors, LLC was established in 1997 by Patrick_J._Shea, _MAI.
