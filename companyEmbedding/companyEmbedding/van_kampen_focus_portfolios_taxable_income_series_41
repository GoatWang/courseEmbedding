 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Unitholders of Van   
Kampen Focus Portfolios, Series 390 (Central Equity Trust, Diversified Income   
Series 10):                                                                     
We have audited the accompanying statement of condition (including the    
analysis of net assets) and the related portfolio schedule of Central Equity    
Trust, Diversified Income Series 10 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios,   
Series 390) as of May 31, 2006 and the related statements of operations and     
changes in net assets for the period from June 4, 2003 (Initial Date of Deposit)
through May 31, 2004 and the years ended May 31, 2005 and 2006. These statements
are the responsibility of the Trustee and the Sponsor. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on such statements based on our audits.                      
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public    
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Trust is not        
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal       
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal 
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an  
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial     
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and          
significant estimates made by the Trustee and Sponsor, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation  
of securities owned at May 31, 2006 by correspondence with the Trustee. We      
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.             
   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Central Equity Trust,          
Diversified Income Series 10 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Series   
390) as of May 31, 2006 and the results of operations and changes in net assets

 VAN KAMPEN FOCUS PORTFOLIOS, SERIES 390
 Notes to Financial Statements
 May 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             
Security Valuation - Securities are valued as described in Prospectus Part
II.                                                                             

  Security Cost - The cost of the Securities is determined based on the actual
price paid by the Trust on the various dates of deposit.                        

  Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit based upon (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the process of   
being collected, (2) the Securities in the Trust based on the value as described
in Note 1 and (3) accumulated dividends thereon, less accrued expenses of the   
Trust, if any.                                                                  

Federal Income Taxes - Unitholders are considered to be the owner of a pro
rata portion of the related Trust and, accordingly, no provisions have been made
for Federal income taxes.                                                       

Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of    
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are       
reported on an identified cost basis.                                           

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO                                                              
Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized  
appreciation (depreciation) at May 31, 2006 is as follows:                      

Unrealized Appreciation       $    19,821,843                             
Unrealized Depreciation            (2,454,000)

NOTE 3- OTHER                                                                   
Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Underwriter    
intends to maintain a market for Units and to continuously offer to purchase    
Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the value of the     
Securities in the portfolio of the Trust valued as described in Note 1, plus    
accumulated dividends to the date of settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds 
demand, or for other business reasons, the Underwriter may discontinue purchases
of Units at such prices. In the event that a market is not maintained for the   
Units, a Unitholder desiring to dispose of his Units may be able to do so only  
by tendering such units to the Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.  

   Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on adding to the
underlying value of the Securities per Unit on the date of an investor's        
purchase, plus an amount equal to the maximum sales charge of 4.50% of the      
public offering price which is equivalent to 4.712% of the aggregate underlying 
value of the Securities. On each June 4, commencing June 4, 2004, the secondary 
market sales charge will decrease by .5 of 1% to a minimum sales charge of 2.3%.

Compensation of Sponsor and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.0025 per Unit, not to 
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to all  
applicable Trusts). The Sponsor receives and annual fee for performing          
bookkeeping and administrative services for the Trust. Both fees may be adjusted
for increases under the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the     
Consumer Price Index.                                                           

NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS                                                    
   During the period from June 4, 2003 (Initial Date of Deposit) through May 31,
2004 and the years ended May 31, 2005 and 2006, 269,026 Units, 459,189 Units and
585,885 Units, respectively, were presented for redemption.

THE TRUST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a
Trust Indenture and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the date of  
this prospectus (the "Initial Date of Deposit"), among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as
Sponsor, Van Kampen Asset Management, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York,  
as Trustee and, in certain cases, as Evaluator, or their predecessors. Effective
April 23, 2001 American Portfolio Evaluation Services, a division of Van Kampen 
Investment Advisory Corp., resigned as Evaluator and The Bank of New York was   
appointed successor Evaluator.                                                  

   The Trust offers the opportunity to purchase Units representing proportionate
interests in a portfolio of equity securities. The Trust may be an appropriate  
medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of common stocks  
with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.   

On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited delivery statements 
relating to contracts for the purchase of the Securities and an irrevocable     
letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the Trustee. In
exchange for these contracts the Trustee delivered to the Sponsor documentation 
evidencing the ownership of Units of the Trust. Unless otherwise terminated as  
provided in the Trust Agreement, the Trust will terminate on the Mandatory      
Termination Date and any remaining Securities will be liquidated or distributed 
by the Trustee within a reasonable time. As used in this prospectus the term    
"Securities" means the securities (including contracts to purchase these        
securities) listed in the "Portfolio" in Part One and any additional securities 
deposited into the Trust.                                                       

Additional Units may be issued at any time by depositing in the Trust (i) 
additional Securities, (ii) contracts to purchase Securities together with cash 
or irrevocable letters of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter of credit or the    
equivalent) with instructions to purchase additional Securities. As additional  
Units are issued by the Trust, the aggregate value of the Securities will be    
increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each Unit will be
decreased. The Sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the Trust  
following the Initial Date of Deposit, provided that the additional deposits    
will be in amounts which will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the same      
percentage relationship among the number of shares of each Security in the      
Trust's portfolio as existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit.       
Investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in     
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the Securities
between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the Securities and because  
the Trust will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees.                

   Each Unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the Trust. To
the extent that any Units are redeemed by the Trustee or additional Units are   
issued as a result of additional Securities being deposited by the Sponsor, the 
fractional undivided interest in the Trust represented by each unredeemed Unit  
will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual interest in the Trust
will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender 
to the Trustee by Unitholders, which may include the Sponsor, or until the      
termination of the Trust Agreement.                                             

The Trust consists of (a) the Securities (including contracts for the     
purchase thereof) listed under the "Portfolio" in Part One as may continue to be
held from time to time in the Trust, (b) any additional Securities acquired and 
held by the Trust pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement and (c) any 
cash held in the related Income and Capital Accounts. Neither the Sponsor nor   
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the Securities.

OBJECTIVES AND SECURITIES SELECTION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of the Trust is to provide capital appreciation and dividend
income. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of 
stocks of companies which may include United States domestic electric utilities,
natural gas utilities, water utilities, telecommunications companies, real      
estate investment trusts, technology companies, health care companies, consumer 
products companies, consumer cyclicals companies, consumer staples companies,   
energy companies, industrials companies or financial services companies. The    
portfolio consists of securities selected by research analysts at Edward D.     
Jones & Co., L.P. (the "Underwriter") and approved by the Sponsor. In selecting 
the Securities, the following factors, among others, were considered: dividend  
yield, geographic diversification, earnings growth rates, regulatory climate and
stock valuation. At the time the Securities were selected, the Underwriter's    
research analysts were currently covering all the issuers of the Securities and 
had published favorable recommendations for each of them. There can be no       
assurance that such coverage will continue for any issuer during the life of the
Trust or that the report on any such issuer will continue to be favorable. A    
downgrade in an analyst's recommendation for an issuer, or the termination of   
such coverage, could negatively affect the performance of the Trust.            

You should note that the selection criteria were applied to the Securities
for inclusion in the Trust as of the Initial Date of Deposit. After this date,  
the Securities may no longer meet the selection criteria. Should a Security no  
longer meet the selection criteria, we will generally not remove the Security   
from the portfolio. In offering the Units to the public, neither the Sponsor nor
any broker-dealers are recommending any of the individual Securities but rather 
the entire pool of Securities, taken as a whole, which are represented by the   
Units.                                                                          

 Telecommunications. The emergence of a global, networked economy appears to
be changing the face of the telecommunications industry. Telecommunications     
companies provide local, long distance and wireless telephone, as well as cable 
television and internet, services and information systems, manufacture          
telecommunications products, and operate voice, data and telecommunications     
networks. As the technology driving this industry group continues to develop and
evolve, telecommunications companies could continue to grow in both customer    
base and services offered.                                                      

  Financial Services. The Trust may invest significantly in financial services
companies. Many banks, insurance companies and other financial services         
companies have recently made changes in the products they offer. The financial  
services industry has experienced a high level of consolidations, mergers and   
acquisitions as well as other regulatory issues. This industry group may be     
appealing for reasons such as deregulation of the banking industry and          
accelerated earnings growth. These factors can potentially provide advantages to
those investing in this industry group.                                         

Utilities. The environment of the electric, natural gas and water utility 
industry appears to be adapting to include recent changes in regulatory         
requirements as well as technological changes. In the past, this industry was   
fraught with government mandated monopolies. Today, many states are deregulating
their utilities which may result in lowering some of the barriers to            
competition. Additionally, utility companies appear to be expanding their       
services and offerings to include other retail services not traditionally       
offered. The growth and expansion occurring could potentially continue as the   
utility industry proceeds through these transformations.                        

  Real Estate Investment Trusts. A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a
company that buys, develops, finances and/or manages income-producing real      
estate such as apartments, shopping centers, offices and warehouses. A REIT can 
be a good way to invest in commercial real estate. Compared to traditional      
direct investments in real estate, which may be difficult to sell and value,    
REITs are traded on major stock exchanges making them highly liquid. REIT       
investors also gain the advantage of skilled management since REIT management   
teams tend to be experts within their specific property or geographic niches.   
Many believe that the attractive features of property ownership and stock       
ownership are combined in this investment vehicle. REITs can provide investors  
with current income, as they are currently required to distribute 90% of taxable
income annually, and can have the potential for attractive returns. They have   
historically had low relative volatility and may provide inflation protection.  

Consumer Staples. Consumer staples is a relatively mature industry, with  
growth in line with population growth. Recent waves of consolidation in the     
industry have reduced the number of competitors, which has enabled product price
increases in some sectors. Additionally, product innovation has proven key to   
growth and should lead to above-industry growth rates for successful companies. 
The industry is characterized primarily by stable, high-profit margin companies,
several of which pay attractive dividends.                                      

Industrials. The industrials industry includes capital goods, commercial  
services and transportation companies. Generally, growth prospects for the      
industry are tied to economic factors such as consumer and business spending,   
U.S. Gross Domestic Product and exports to foreign nations. The increasingly    
global economy should increase the demand for industrial products made by U.S.  
firms. Within capital goods, defense and electronics are some of the fastest    
growing areas, given the political support for higher government spending on    
defense initiatives. Many industrials companies are well-established and have   
demonstrated a track record of paying dividends and increasing the amount of    
dividends paid over time.                                                       

   Health Care. An aging population, new drug development and product innovation
should drive growth for this industry. Additionally, foreign demand for health  
care, particularly from developing nations, continues to increase. The industry 
has historically grown at a rate faster than the overall economy and that trend 
should continue. Research and development spending, supported by strong demand, 
should lead to new products. Health care companies have traditionally paid part 
of earnings as dividends, which is expected to continue. Given the growth       
prospects for the industry, dividend growth should be meaningful as well.       

  Energy. As the world economy grows, energy use is also expected to rise. The
companies that produce oil and natural gas are finding and developing new       
sources worldwide to satisfy this growing need. Oil companies also refine crude 
oil into useful products such as gasoline and jet fuel, as well as provide the  
raw materials for a wide variety of plastics. Investors benefit from the        
diversity of their businesses, their global reach, and their ability to find    
attractive opportunities in the changing energy marketplace.                    

Technology. The Trust may invest in technology companies. Technology      
companies generally include companies involved in the development, design,      
manufacture and sale of computers, computer related equipment, computer         
networks, communications systems, telecommunications products, electronic       
products, and other related products, systems and services. Technology is a     
cyclical industry, driven by corporate and consumer spending on technology      
products, services and software. New technologies have the potential to increase
productivity and enable new applications. Stable spending on traditional        
technology platforms such as personal computers, plus spending on new           
technologies, should enable the industry to grow faster than the economy.       
Several technology companies are generating substantial excess cash, which they 
have used to begin paying dividends. These companies have the potential to      
increase their dividends on a regular basis.                                    

Consumer Cyclicals. The Trust may invest in companies that manufacture or 
sell products or services, the demand for which is easily influenced by general 
economic conditions. Industries within this segment include advertising,        
airlines, auto parts, auto manufacturing, broadcasting, casinos, clothing and   
fabrics, consumer electronics, entertainment, footwear, furnishings and         
appliances, home construction, lodging, publishing, recreational products and   
services, restaurants, apparel retailers, broadline retailers, drug-based       
retailers, specialty retailers, tires and toys. These companies would be        
expected to perform well during an improving economy but may lag during a       
declining economy. Industries within this group that may hold potential for     
above-average growth include niche retailing, entertainment and media. Many     
companies within this sector are becoming more dividends-focused, and may       
increase their dividends going forward.                                         

Consumer Products. Consumer products is a relatively mature industry, with
growth in-line with population growth. Recent waves of consolidation in the     
industry have reduced the number of competitors, which has enabled product price
increases in some sectors. Additionally, product innovation has proven key to   
growth and should lead to above-industry growth rates for successful companies. 
The industry is characterized primarily by stable, high-profit margin companies,
several of which pay attractive dividends.                                      

  Underwriter Activities. The Underwriter may recommend or effect transactions
in the Securities in its day to day brokerage activities. This may have an      
adverse effect on the prices of the Securities. This also may have an impact on 
the price the Trust pays for the Securities and the price received upon Unit    
redemptions or Trust termination.                                               

The Underwriter, in its day to day activities, may act as a broker, agent,
principal or market maker in connection with the purchase and sale of equity    
securities, including the Securities. The Underwriter may also provide          
investment banking services to the issuers of, or issue reports and make        
recommendations on, the Securities. For any of these brokerage, market-making or
investment banking activities, the Underwriter may receive additional           
compensation. The Underwriter may also receive compensation based on commissions
generated by sales of Units in addition to its concession or agency commission. 
See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".                    

RISK FACTORS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your Trust. You should understand these   
risks before you invest. If the value of the securities falls, the value of your
Units will also fall. We cannot guarantee that your Trust will achieve its      
objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.      

   Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your
Trust will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below    
your original purchase price. Market value fluctuates in response to various    
factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial  
condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or ratings on a    
security of the issuer. Even though your Trust is supervised, you should        
remember that we do not manage your Trust. Your Trust will not sell a security  
solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.         

  Dividend Payment Risk. Dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a
security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security. Stocks represent   
ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.      
Common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has
provided for payment of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when     
declared by an issuer's board of directors, and the amount of any dividend may  
vary over time.                                                                 

Financial Services Companies. The Trust invests significantly in banks,   
insurance companies and other financial services companies. Banks and their     
holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic     
recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations in geographic      
markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and competition    
from new entrants in their fields of business. In addition, banks and their     
holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level 
and may be adversely affected by increased regulations.                         

  Banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as
regulatory changes, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial services overhaul  
legislation, permit new entrants to offer various financial products.           
Technological advances such as the Internet allow these nontraditional lending  
sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data.     
Banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms 
and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services    
that were traditionally offered by banks.                                       

Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are   
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the 
volatility of the equity market in general. Adverse changes in the direction of 
the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health of customers, equity
transaction volume, the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of
emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the 
stock prices, of these companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including
increased competition with new and existing competitors, the ongoing            
commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital    
expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of     
companies in the investment management and brokerage industries. Companies      
involved in investment management and brokerage activities are also subject to  
extensive regulation by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations,  
and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such     
laws, regulations and rules, could adversely affect the stock prices of such    
companies.                                                                      

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a       
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and   
pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other natural or man-made 
disasters and the effects of client mergers. Already extensively regulated,     
insurance companies' profits may be adversely affected by increased government  
regulation or tax law changes.                                                  

Utility Companies. Many utility companies, especially electric and gas and
other energy related utility companies, are subject to various uncertainties,   
including:                                                                      

o    risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;            

    o    restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;     

  o    regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;            

o    coping with the general effects of energy conservation;          

    o    technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;                                       

o    the effects of local weather, maturing markets and difficulty in 
 expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors;

o    the potential impact of natural or man-made disasters;           

 o    difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
       frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;

o    the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;

o    difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities; and                                      

o    increased competition.                                           

Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the 
supply of or demand for energy, such as electricity or natural gas, or water, or
the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could adversely
affect the profitability of the issuers of the Securities and the performance of
the Trust.                                                                      

Utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and  
state levels in the United States. At the federal level, the Federal Energy     
Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"),   
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and the Nuclear Regulatory  
Commission (the "NRC") have authority to oversee electric and combination       
electric and gas utilities. The value of utility company stocks may decline     
because governmental regulation affecting the utilities industry can change.    
This regulation may prevent or delay the utility company from passing along cost
increases to its customers, which could hinder the utility company's ability to 
meet its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures, 
including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary     
bankruptcy proceedings, by its creditors against such utility company. In 2001, 
two California public utilities were threatened with such action by their       
wholesale suppliers, and one of these utilities filed a voluntary petition for  
relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code of 1978. Furthermore,       
regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and other pressures,  
may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting or operational    
policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's profitability and its 
stock price. In late 2001, a trader and marketer of utilities, commodities and  
financial and risk management services filed a voluntary petition for relief    
under Chapter 11 as a result of being negatively impacted by several of these   
and other factors. Mergers in the utility industry may require approval from    
several federal and state regulatory agencies, including FERC, the FTC, and the 
SEC. These regulatory authorities could, as a matter of policy, reverse the     
trend toward deregulation and make consolidation more difficult, or cause delay 
in the merger process, any of which could cause the prices of these stocks to   
fall.                                                                           

   Real Estate Investment Trusts. Many factors can have an adverse impact on the
performance of a particular REIT, including its cash available for distribution,
the credit quality of a particular REIT or the real estate industry generally.  
The success of REITs depends on various factors, including occupancy and rent   
levels, appreciation of the underlying property and the ability to raise rents  
on those properties. Economic recession, overbuilding, tax law changes, higher  
interest rates or excessive speculation can all negatively impact REITs and     
their future earnings and share prices.                                         

Risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate include, among  
other factors,                                                                  

o    general U.S. and global as well as local economic conditions;    

o    decline in real estate values;                                   

o    the financial health of tenants;                                 

o    overbuilding and increased competition for tenants;              

o    oversupply of properties for sale;                               

o    changing demographics;                                           

 o    changes in interest rates, tax rates and other operating expenses;

o    changes in government regulations;                               

o    changes in zoning laws;                                          

   o    the ability of the owner to provide adequate management, maintenance
and insurance;                                              

 o    faulty construction and the ongoing need for capital improvements;

o    the cost of complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act;  

    o    regulatory and judicial requirements, including relating to liability
for environmental hazards;                                  

o    natural or man-made disasters;                                   

o    changes in the perception of prospective tenants of the safety,  
convenience and attractiveness of the properties;           

o    changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand; and             

o    the unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at
rates acceptable to developers.                             

   Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in terms
of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate generally and 
REITs in particular. Properties owned by a REIT may not be adequately insured   
against certain losses and may be subject to significant environmental          
liabilities, including remediation costs.                                       

   You should also be aware that REITs may not be diversified and are subject to
the risks of financing projects. The real estate industry may be cyclical, and, 
if the Trust acquires REIT Securities at or near the top of the cycle, there is 
increased risk of a decline in value of the REIT Securities and therefore the   
value of the Units. REITs are also subject to defaults by borrowers and the     
market's perception of the REIT industry generally.                             

   Because of their structure, and the legal requirement that they distribute at
least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually, REITs require       
frequent amounts of new funding, through both borrowing money and issuing stock.
Thus, REITs historically have frequently issued substantial amounts of new      
equity shares (or equivalents) to purchase or build new properties. This may    
have adversely affected REIT equity share market prices. Both existing and new  
share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in the future,       
especially when REITs continue to issue stock when real estate prices are       
relatively high and stock prices are relatively low.                            

Consumer Staples. The Trust may invest significantly in companies that    
manufacture or sell various consumer staples. General risks of these companies  
include the general state of the economy, intense competition and consumer      
spending trends. A decline in the economy or other change which results in a    
reduction of consumers' disposable income can negatively impact spending habits.
Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or reduced
market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials costs,  
an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product       
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

Industrials. The Trust may invest significantly in industrials companies. 
General risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy,
intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess 
capacity and consumer spending trends. Capital goods companies may also be      
significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic cycles,     
technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply of key   
materials, labor relations, government regulations, government contracts and    
e-commerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry 
have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led
to the overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the     
industry may face similar scrutiny.                                             

  Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment 
manufacturers.                                                                  

Health Care Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in health care    
companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices 
and instruments, drugs and biotec hnology, managed care, hospital               
management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face           
substantial government regulation and approval procedures. Congress and the     
President have proposed, and in some cases approved, a variety of legislative   
changes concerning health care issuers from time to time, including, but not    
limited to, cost and prescription drug price controls and more rigorous approval
processes for new pharmaceuticals and devices. Additional government regulation,
or any change in existing regulation, can have a significantly unfavorable      
effect on the price and availability of products and services.                  

Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing      
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of   
patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a       
product will never come to market. The research and development costs of        
bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial. This process  
involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval. These         
companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years,
if at all. The failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a    
substantial negative impact on a company and its stock.                         

Energy Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in energy companies.   
Energy companies face risks related to political conditions in oil producing    
regions (such as the Middle East), the actions of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC), the price and worldwide supply of oil and natural   
gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the ability to find and   
acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable, operating       
hazards, government regulation and the level of consumer demand. Political      
conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in the past.        
Political instability or war in these regions could have a negative impact on   
your investment. Oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile. OPEC     
controls a substantial portion of world oil production. OPEC may take actions to
increase or suppress the price or availability of oil. Various domestic and     
foreign government authorities and international cartels also impact these      
prices. Any substantial decline in these prices could have an adverse effect on 
energy companies. Energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire  
additional energy reserves. The exploration and recovery process involves       
significant operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy company has no  
assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be         
economically recoverable. The industry also faces substantial government        
regulation, including environmental regulation. These regulations have increased
costs and limited production and usage of certain fuels. Furthermore, certain   
companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged         
accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their       
financial results, and other companies in the industry may face similar         
scrutiny.                                                                       

Technology Companies. Technology companies face risks related to rapidly  
changing technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market patterns,      
evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. An          
unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a     
technology company. The failure of a technology company to introduce new        
products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology, can have
a negative impact on the company's results. Technology stocks tend to experience
substantial price volatility and speculative trading. Announcements about new   
products, technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock
prices to fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price and volume   
fluctuations may occur in the Securities of companies in this industry group    
that are unrelated to the operating performance of the company.                 

 The market for certain products may have only recently begun to develop, is
rapidly evolving or is characterized by an increase in suppliers. Key components
of some technology products are available only from limited sources. This can   
impact the cost of and ability to acquire these components. Some technology     
companies service highly concentrated customer bases of only a limited number of
large companies. Any failure to meet the standards of these customers could     
result in a significant loss or reduction in sales. Many products and           
technologies are incorporated into other products. As a result, some companies  
are sometimes highly dependent on the performance of other technology companies.
We cannot guarantee that these customers will continue to place additional      
orders or will place orders in similar quantities as in the past.               

The life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short,  
resulting in volatile sales, earnings and stock prices for many technology      
companies. Additionally, with the rapid evolution of technologies, competitive  
advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls.            
Historically, many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the       
consumer, as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or       
pricing power. Some of the large technology companies have been involved in     
antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future. A slowdown in        
corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company
revenues. Technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part
of their revenues. Any economic slowdown could hurt revenues.                   

   Consumer Cyclicals. The success of companies in the consumer cyclicals sector
depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and is     
subject to severe competition. Therefore, the success of consumer cyclicals     
companies is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international  
economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. A slowdown in the 
economy would likely hurt the consumer cyclicals industry. The success of       
companies in the consumer cyclicals segment is also strongly affected by changes
in demographics and consumer tastes.                                            

Consumer Products. The Trust may invest significantly in companies that   
manufacture or sell various consumer products. General risks of these companies 
include the general state of the economy, intense competition and consumer      
spending trends. A decline in the economy which results in a reduction of       
consumers' disposable income can negatively impact spending habits. Furthermore,
the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or reduced market      
acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials costs, an      
inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product liability
claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance and stock 
prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.                     

Telecommunications Companies. The Trust invests significantly in          
telecommunications companies. These companies are subject to substantial        
governmental regulation. For example, the United States government and state    
governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a 
company may offer. This industry has experienced substantial deregulation in    
recent years. Deregulation may lead to fierce competition for market share and  
can have a negative impact on certain companies. Recent federal legislation     
governing the United States telecommunications industry remains subject to      
judicial review and additional interpretation, which may adversely affect the   
companies whose securities are held by the Trust. Competitive pressures are     
intense and telecommunications stocks can experience rapid volatility. Certain  
telecommunications products may become outdated very rapidly. A company's       
performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological    
advances.                                                                       

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications      
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

Certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than  
larger, established issuers. Smaller companies may have limited product lines,  
markets or financial resources. Their securities may trade in lower volumes than
larger companies. As a result, the prices of these securities may fluctuate more
than the prices of other issuers.                                               

No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in the Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price which includes the
underlying value of the Securities, the sales charge, and cash, if any, in the  
Income and Capital Accounts. The maximum sales charge assessed to each          
Unitholder is set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in   
Part One. The secondary market sales charge will reduce annually by 0.5% to a   
minimum of 2.30% as set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information"
in Part One. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ 
slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the 
calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.  

   Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and children under
21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the
benefit of such persons) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates, the       
Underwriter, and dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public  
Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession.                           

The minimum purchase is 200 Units but may vary by selling firm.           

Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts 
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part One
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying Securities in   
the Trust. The initial price of the Securities was determined by the Trustee.   
The Trustee will generally determine the value of the Securities as of the      
Evaluation Time on each business day and will adjust the Public Offering Price  
of Units accordingly. The Evaluation Time is the close of the New York Stock    
Exchange on each business day. The term "business day", as used herein and under
"Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units", excludes Saturdays, Sundays and   
holidays observed by the New York Stock Exchange. The Public Offering Price per 
Unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time on  
each business day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time  
and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the          
Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time        
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders      
received by the Sponsor after the Evaluation Time, and orders received by       
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or orders received 
by such persons that are not transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time    
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of the next determined  
Public Offering Price per Unit provided they are received timely by the Sponsor 
on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to 
transmit orders received by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a   
timely manner.                                                                  

The value of portfolio securities is based on the securities' market price
when available. When a market price is not readily available, including         
circumstances under which the Trustee determines that a security's market price 
is not accurate, a portfolio security is valued at its fair value, as determined
under procedures established by the Trustee or an independent pricing service   
used by the Trustee. In these cases, the Trust's net asset value will reflect   
certain portfolio securities' fair value rather than their market price. With   
respect to securities that are primarily listed on foreign exchanges, the value 
of the portfolio securities may change on days when you will not be able to     
purchase or sell Units. The value of any foreign securities is based on the     
applicable currency exchange rate as of the Evaluation Time. The Sponsor will   
provide price dissemination and oversight services to the Trust.                

   Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by the Sponsor and
the Underwriter at the Public Offering Price.                                   

The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. The  
Underwriter will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with
the distribution of Units as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter
Compensation".                                                                  

 Except as provided in this section, any discount provided to investors will
be borne by the selling dealer or agent as indicated under "General" above.     
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no case shall the total of  
any concessions, agency commissions and any additional compensation allowed or  
paid to any broker, dealer or other distributor of Units with respect to any    
individual transaction exceed the total sales charge applicable to such         
transaction. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any 
order for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or   
agency commission to dealers and others from time to time.                      

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional 
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of the Trusts and our
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of  
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related         
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the Trust and our other products. Fees may      
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection  
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars 
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for  
your Units.                                                                     

Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation. The Sponsor will receive a gross sales
commission equal to the total sales charge applicable to each transaction. The  
Underwriter will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with
the distribution of Units equal to 65% of the sales charge applicable to the    
transaction. Any sales charge discount provided to investors will be borne by   
the selling dealer or agent. In addition, the Sponsor will realize a profit or  
loss as a result of the difference between the price paid for the Securities by 
the Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to the Trust on the Initial Date of  
Deposit as well as on subsequent deposits. The Sponsor has not participated as  
sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicate or  
as an agent in a private placement for any of the Securities. The Underwriter   
may benefit from, or receive compensation in connection with, activities        
described under "Objectives and Securities Selection". The Sponsor may realize  
profit or loss as a result of the possible fluctuations in the market value of  
the Securities, since all proceeds received from purchasers of Units are        
retained by the Underwriter. In maintaining a secondary market, the Underwriter 
will realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price
at which Units are purchased and the price at which Units are resold (which     
price includes the applicable sales charge) or from a redemption of repurchased 
Units at a price above or below the purchase price. Cash, if any, made available
to the Sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be 
used in the Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor,
subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.              

The Sponsor, the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may have   
participated in a public offering of one or more of the Securities. The Sponsor,
the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them or their employees may have a 
long or short position in these Securities or related securities. The Sponsor,  
the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may act as a specialist or    
market maker for these Securities. An officer, director or employee of the      
Sponsor, the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may be an officer or 
director for issuers of the Securities.                                         

Purchases and sales of Securities by the Trust may impact the value of the
Securities. This may especially be the case during the initial offering of      
Units, upon Trust termination and in the course of satisfying large Unit        
redemptions. Any publication of a list of Securities, or a list of anticipated  
Securities, to be included in the Trust may also cause increased buying activity
in certain Securities. Once this information becomes public, investors may      
purchase individual Securities appearing in such a publication and may do so    
during or prior to the initial offering of Units. It is possible that these     
investors could include investment advisory and brokerage firms of the Sponsor, 
the Underwriter or the affiliates of either of them or firms that are           
distributing Units. This activity may cause the Trust to purchase stocks at a   
higher price than those buyers who effect purchases prior to purchases by the   
Trust.                                                                          

  Market for Units. Although it is not obligated to do so, the Underwriter may
maintain a market for Units and purchase Units at the secondary market          
repurchase price, which is described under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units". The Underwriter may discontinue purchases of Units or discontinue       
purchases at this price at any time. In the event that a secondary market is not
maintained, a Unitholder will be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to  
the Trustee for redemption at the Redemption Price. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Redemption of Units". Unitholders should contact their broker to   
determine the best price for Units in the secondary market. The Trustee will    
notify the Underwriter of any Units tendered for redemption. If the             
Underwriter's bid in the secondary market equals or exceeds the Redemption Price
per Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which Units would 
have been redeemed by the Trustee. The Underwriter may sell repurchased Units at
the secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit.                            

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Units are available for purchase in connection with certain types of      
tax-sheltered retirement plans, including Individual Retirement Accounts for    
individuals, Simplified Employee Pension Plans for employees, qualified plans   
for self-employed individuals, and qualified corporate pension and profit       
sharing plans for employees. The purchase of Units may be limited by the plans' 
provisions and does not itself establish such plans.                            

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions. Dividends and any net proceeds from the sale of Securities 
received by the Trust will generally be distributed to Unitholders on each      
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date. These  
dates appear under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One. A  
person becomes a Unitholder of record on the date of settlement (generally three
business days after Units are ordered). Unitholders may elect to receive        
distributions in cash or to have distributions reinvested into additional Units.

Dividends received by the Trust are credited to the Income Account of the 
Trust. Other receipts (e.g., capital gains, proceeds from the sale of           
Securities, etc.) are credited to the Capital Account. Proceeds received on the 
sale of any Securities, to the extent not used to meet redemptions of Units or  
to pay fees or expenses, will be distributed to Unitholders. Proceeds received  
from the disposition of any Securities after a Record Date and prior to the     
following Distribution Date will be held in the Capital Account and not         
distributed until the next Distribution Date. Any distribution to Unitholders   
consists of each Unitholder's pro rata share of the available cash in the Income
and Capital Accounts as of the related Record Date.                             

   Estimated Distributions. The estimated initial distribution and estimated net
annual distribution per Unit may be shown under "Summary of Essential Financial 
Information" in Prospectus Part One. The estimate of the income a Trust may     
receive is based on the most recent ordinary quarterly dividends declared by an 
issuer, the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign
issuers, or scheduled income payments (in all cases accounting for any          
applicable foreign withholding taxes). The actual net annual distributions are  
expected to decrease over time. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees 
and expenses during a Trust's life. Dividend and income conventions for certain 
companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in the      
United States and in certain instances, dividends/income paid or declared over  
several years or other periods may be used to estimate annual distributions. The
actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimated 
amount due to changes in a Trust's fees and expenses, in actual income received 
by a Trust, currency fluctuations and with changes in a Trust such as the       
acquisition, call, maturity or sale of Securities. Due to these and various     
other factors, actual income received by a Trust will most likely differ from   
the most recent dividends or scheduled income payments.                         

Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may have distributions automatically     
reinvested in additional Units under the Automatic Reinvestment Option (to the  
extent Units may be lawfully offered for sale in the state in which the         
Unitholder resides). To participate in this reinvestment option, a Unitholder   
must file with the Trustee a written notice of election, together with any      
certificate representing Units and other documentation that the Trustee may then
require, at least five days prior to the related Record Date. A Unitholder's    
election will apply to all Units owned by the Unitholder and will remain in     
effect until changed by the Unitholder. If Units are unavailable for            
reinvestment, distributions will be paid in cash.                               

  In addition, under the Guaranteed Reinvestment Option Unithholders may elect
to have distributions automatically reinvested in certain Van Kampen mutual     
funds (the "Reinvestment Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment         
objectives which differ from those of the Trust. The prospectus relating to each
Reinvestment Fund describes its investment policies and how to begin            
reinvestment. A Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds   
from the Sponsor. Purchases of shares of a Reinvestment Fund will be made at a  
net asset value computed on the Distribution Date. Unitholders with an existing 
Guaranteed Reinvestment Option account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on    
distribution reinvestments) may transfer their existing account into a new      
account which allows purchases of Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value.  

   A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing no later than  
five days before a Distribution Date. The Sponsor, each Reinvestment Fund, and  
its investment adviser shall have the right to suspend or terminate these       
reinvestment plans at any time.                                                 

Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee at Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay Street,    
20th Floor, New York, New York 10286. Certificates must be tendered to the      
Trustee, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with    
signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity in connection with 
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of applicable            
governmental charges, if any. No later than the seventh day following the       
tender, the Unitholder will be entitled to receive in cash an amount for each   
Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed on the date of tender.
The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received by the
Trustee, except that with respect to Units received by the Trustee after the    
Evaluation Time or on a day which is not a Trust business day, the date of      
tender is deemed to be the next business day. Redemption requests received by   
authorized financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are        
properly transmitted to the Trustee by the time designated by the Trustee, are  
priced based on the date of receipt. Redemption requests received by the Trustee
after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by authorized       
financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption requests        
received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until after the
time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the next        
determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the Trustee on 
such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to    
transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee so they will be    
received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge 
an order handling fee for processing redemption requests. Units redeemed        
directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.                      

Unitholders tendering 2,500 or more Units (or $25,000) of the Trust for   
redemption may request an in-kind distribution of Securities equal to the       
Redemption Price per Unit on the date of tender. Unitholders may not request an 
in-kind distribution during the five business days preceding the Trust's        
termination. An in-kind distribution will be made by the Trustee through the    
distribution of each of the Securities in book-entry form to the account of the 
Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company. Amounts representing    
fractional shares will be distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the number
of shares of any Security included in a Unitholder's in-kind distribution to    
facilitate the distribution of whole shares.                                    

The Trustee may sell Securities to satisfy Unit redemptions. To the extent
that Securities are redeemed in-kind or sold, the size of the Trust will be, and
the diversity of the Trust may be, reduced. Sales may be required at a time when
Securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might
otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be more or less   
than the amount paid by the Unitholder, depending on the value of the Securities
at the time of redemption. Special federal income tax consequences will result  
if a Unitholder requests an in-kind distribution. See "Taxation".               

 The Redemption Price per Unit and the secondary market repurchase price per
Unit are equal to the pro rata share of each Unit in the Trust, determined on   
the basis of (i) the cash on hand in the Trust, (ii) the value of the Securities
in the Trust and (iii) dividends receivable on the Securities in the Trust      
trading ex-dividend as of the date of computation, less (a) amounts representing
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the Trust and (b) the accrued
expenses of the Trust. For these purposes, the Evaluator or Trustee will        
determine the value of the Securities in the manner set forth under "Public
Offering--Unit Price".                                                          

   The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary    
weekend and holiday closings, or any period during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the Securities is not reasonably practicable, or
for other periods as the SEC may permit.                                        

   Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form unless a Unitholder
makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in certificate form.   
Units are transferable by making a written request to the Trustee and, in the   
case of Units in certificate form, by presentation of the certificate to the    
Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments 
of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the written request, and certificate or     
transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears on the records of the Trustee  
and on the face of any certificate with the signature guaranteed by a           
participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a  
signature guarantee program accepted by the Trustee. In certain instances the   
Trustee may require additional documents, including but not limited to, trust   
instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or administrator or
certificates of corporate authority. Fractional certificates will not be issued.
The Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee for each           
certificate reissued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may 
be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, stolen,  
mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the Trustee of 
satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred. 
Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.      

   Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of dividends and other
amounts received by the Trust for each distribution. Within a reasonable time   
after the end of each year, each person who was a Unitholder during that year   
will receive a statement describing dividends and capital received, actual Trust
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the Securities and other Trust         
information. Unitholders may obtain evaluations of the Securities upon request  
to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your Trust,     
please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The Sponsor does not have 
access to individual account information.                                       

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portfolio Administration. The Trust is not an actively managed fund and,  
except as provided in the Trust Agreement, Securities generally will not be sold
or replaced after the initial deposit. The Sponsor may, however, direct that    
Securities be sold in certain limited circumstances to protect the Trust based  
on advice from the Supervisor. These situations may include events such as the  
issuer having defaulted on payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the 
price of a Security having declined to such an extent, or other credit factors  
exist, so that in the opinion of the Supervisor retention of the Security would 
be detrimental to the Trust. If a public tender offer has been made for a       
Security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a Security, the
Trustee may either sell the Security or accept a tender offer for cash if the   
Supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in the best interest of        
Unitholders. The Trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to Unitholders. In   
addition, the Trustee may sell Securities to redeem Units or pay Trust expenses.
The Trustee must reject any offer for securities or property other than cash in 
exchange for the Securities. If securities or property are nonetheless acquired 
by the Trust, the Sponsor may direct the Trustee to sell the securities or      
property and distribute the proceeds to Unitholders or to accept the securities 
or property for deposit in the Trust. Should any contract for the purchase of   
any of the Securities fail, the Sponsor will (unless substantially all of the   
moneys held in the Trust to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute     
Securities in accordance with the Trust Agreement) refund the cash and sales    
charge attributable to the failed contract to all Unitholders on or before the  
next Distribution Date.                                                         

When the Trust sells Securities, the composition and diversity of the     
Securities in the Trust may be altered. In order to obtain the best price for   
the Trust, it may be necessary for the Supervisor to specify minimum amounts    
(generally 100 shares) in which blocks of Securities are to be sold. In         
effecting purchases and sales of the Trust's portfolio securities, the Sponsor  
may direct that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to      
brokers, including brokers which may be affiliated with the Trust, the Sponsor, 
the Underwriter or dealers participating in the offering of Units. In addition, 
in selecting among firms to handle a particular transaction, the Sponsor may    
take into account whether the firm has sold or is selling units of unit         
investment trusts which it sponsors.                                            

Pursuant to an exemptive order, when each Trust terminates, it may be     
permitted to sell Securities to a new trust series if those Securities meet the 
investment strategy of the new trust. The exemption may enable each Trust to    
eliminate commission costs on these transactions. The price for those securities
will be the closing sale price on the sale date on the exchange where the       
Securities are principally traded, as certified by the Sponsor.                 

 Amendment of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee and the Sponsor may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely      
affect Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee).
The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or permit
acquisition of securities in addition to or substitution for the Securities     
(except as provided in the Trust Agreement). The Trustee will notify Unitholders
of any amendment.                                                               

 Termination. Each Trust will terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date or
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held in the Trust. A    
Trust may be terminated at any time with consent of Unitholders representing    
two-thirds of the outstanding Units or by the Trustee when the value of the     
Trust is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has exceeded  
$15,000,000) (the "Minimum Termination Value"). Unitholders will be notified of 
any termination. The Trustee may begin to sell Securities in connection with a  
Trust termination nine business days before, and no later than, the Mandatory   
Termination Date. Approximately thirty days before this date, the Trustee will  
notify Unitholders of the termination and provide a form enabling qualified     
Unitholders to elect an in kind distribution of Securities. You are qualified to
elect an in kind distribution of Securities at termination if you own at least  
1,000 Units of your Trust on the termination date (or such higher amount as may 
be required by your broker-dealer or selling agent). Any in kind distribution of
Securities at termination will be made in the manner and subject to the         
restrictions described under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". In   
order to receive an in kind distribution of Securities at termination, this form
or other notice acceptable to the Trustee must be received by the Trustee at    
least five business days prior to the Mandatory Termination Date. Unitholders   
will receive a final cash distribution within a reasonable time after the       
Mandatory Termination Date. All distributions will be net of Trust expenses and 
costs. Unitholders will receive a final distribution statement following        
termination. The Information Supplement contains further information regarding  
termination of the Trust. See "Additional Information".                         

 Limitations on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Underwriter, Supervisor Evaluator,
if any, and Trustee are under no liability for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee is not liable  
for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of any of
the Securities. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the     
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and is not liable for any action
taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not liable  
for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed on the Securities, on it as 
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on the Trust, which the Trustee may be     
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Sponsor, Underwriter, and Supervisor may rely on any evaluation    
furnished by the Evaluator, if any, or the Trustee and have no responsibility   
for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by the Trustee shall be made in good   
faith upon the basis of the best information available to it.

 Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring
Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to  
report personal securities transactions. This code is intended to avoid         
potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct   
with respect to the Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional       
information about the Sponsor.                                                  

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust as       
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Underwriter. Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., a Missouri limited partnership, is
the Underwriter for the Units. The Underwriter is a member of the National      
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and has its principal office at 12555   
Manchester Road, St. Louis, Missouri, 63131, (314) 515-2000.

principal, specialist or market maker in connection with the purchase and sale  
of equity securities, including the Securities. The Underwriter may also provide
investment banking services to, and may expect to receive or intend to seek     
compensation for underwriting services in the next three months from, some of   
the issuers of the Securities. Principals of the Underwriter may serve as a     
member of the board of directors of one or more issuers of the Securities or of 
affiliates of such issuers. Furthermore, the Underwriter may issue reports and  
make recommendations on the Securities. For any of these brokerage, specialist, 
market-making or investment banking activities, the Underwriter may receive     
additional compensation. The Underwriter may also receive compensation based on 
commissions generated by sales of Units in addition to its concession or agency 
commission. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".        

   Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under

TAXATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date of this      
prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries 
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these
summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a  
non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. 
In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax    
consequences.                                                                   

   This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of
counsel to the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any    
conclusions set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to
review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax 
treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. This may not be sufficient
for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.     

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Assets of the Trust. The Trust is expected to hold one or more of the     
following: (i) shares of stock in corporations (the "Stocks") that are treated  
as equity for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) equity interests in real    
estate investment trusts (the "REIT Shares") that constitute interests in       
entities treated as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax        
purposes.                                                                       

 It is possible that the Trust will also hold other assets, including assets
that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those         
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences    
different from or in addition to those described in this section. All of the    
assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets". Neither our counsel nor 
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets and
thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal 
income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.                                       

Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with the
documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income tax 
law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata       
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., dividends and capital gains, if any) 
from each Trust Asset when such income would be considered to be received by you
if you directly owned the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have  
your distributions reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income    
from Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax        
purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses. 

   Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss Upon Disposition. If your Trust disposes of
Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of your 
Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain or  
loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your tax  
basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount received  
in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax basis in each  
Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, including sales charges,    
among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire
your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to adjust your tax  
basis after you acquire your Units (for example, in the case of certain         
dividends that exceed a corporation's accumulated earnings and profits, or in   
the case of certain distributions with respect to REIT Shares that represent a  
return of capital, as discussed below).                                         

If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net   
capital gain is generally 15% (generally 5% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and
15% tax brackets). These capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable
years beginning before January 1, 2009. For later periods, if you are an        
individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is       
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The  
20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term      
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding
period of more than five years.                                                 

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital 
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as  
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however, treats certain capital 
gains as ordinary income in special situations. Capital gain received from      
assets held for more than one year that is considered "unrecaptured section 1250
gain" (which may be the case, for example, with some capital gains attributable 
to the REIT Shares) is taxed at a maximum stated tax rate of 25%. In the case of
capital gains dividends, the determination of which portion of the capital gains
dividend, if any, is subject to the 25% tax rate, will be made based on rules   
prescribed by the United States Treasury.                                       

  Dividends From Stocks. Certain dividends received with respect to the Stocks
may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as    
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.   
These special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates
generally apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009.              

Dividends From REIT Shares. Some dividends on the REIT Shares may be      
designated as "capital gain dividends," generally taxable to you as long-term   
capital gains. If you hold a Unit for six months or less or if your Trust holds 
a REIT Share for six months or less, any loss incurred by you related to the    
disposition of such REIT Share will be treated as a long-term capital loss to   
the extent of any long-term capital gain distributions received (or deemed to   
have been received) with respect to such REIT Share. Distributions of income or 
capital gains declared on the REIT Shares in October, November or December will 
be deemed to have been paid to you on December 31 of the year they are declared,
even when paid by the REIT during the following January. Other dividends on the 
REIT Shares will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income, although in    
limited circumstances, some of the ordinary income dividends from a REIT may    
also qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gains (as  
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.   
These special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from  
real estate investment trusts generally apply to taxable years beginning before 
January 1, 2009.                                                                

Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns Units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many        
dividends received by the Trust, because the dividends received deduction is not
available for dividends from most foreign corporations or from REITs.           

In-kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this   
prospectus, you may request an in-kind distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units or at your Trust's termination. By electing to receive an     
in-kind distribution, you will receive Trust Assets, plus, possibly, cash. You  
will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole Trust Assets in       
exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same Trust    
Assets held by your Trust. However, if you also receive cash in exchange for a  
Trust Asset or a fractional portion of a Trust Asset, you will generally        
recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you   
receive and your tax basis in such Trust Asset or fractional portion.           

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, it is considered a sale for federal income   
tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any
loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in          
connection with the exchange of your Units of your Trusts for units of the next 
series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and        
subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have substantially   
identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Internal Revenue   
Code.                                                                           

Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You  
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust to the same   
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat some or
all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.         
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the    
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.                                 

Foreign Taxes. Distributions by your Trust that are treated as U.S. source
income (e.g., dividends received on Stocks of domestic corporations) will       
generally be subject to U.S. income taxation and withholding in the case of     
Units held by nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations or other      
non-U.S. persons, subject to any applicable treaty. If you are a foreign        
investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S.     
corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you may not be subject to U.S.      
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some of the income from   
your Trust or on any gain from the sale or redemption of your Units, provided   
that certain conditions are met. You should consult your tax advisor with       
respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for U.S. tax      
purposes. You should also consult your tax advisor with respect to other U.S.   
tax withholding and reporting requirements.                                     

   Some distributions by your Trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you. Under the grantor   
trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign 
taxes that are paid. Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you may be entitled to a 
foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.                        

New York Tax Status. Based on the advice of Katten Muchin Rosenman, LLP,  
special counsel to the Trust for New York tax matters, under the existing income
tax laws of the State and City of New York, your Trust will not be taxed as a   
corporation, and the income of your Trust will pass through to the Unit holders 
in the same manner as for federal income tax purposes. You should consult your  
tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state or local taxation with respect to
your Units.                                                                     

TRUST OPERATING EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. The fees and expenses of the Trust will accrue on a daily basis. The
fees and expenses are generally paid out of the Capital Account of the Trust. It
is expected that Securities will be sold to pay these amounts, which will result
in capital gains or losses to Unitholders. See "Taxation". The Sponsor's,       
Evaluator's, Supervisor's and Trustee's fees may be increased without approval  
of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the   
category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index or, if 
this category is not published, in a comparable category.                       

Trustee's Fee. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee from the 
Trust set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One. 
The Trustee benefits to the extent there are funds in the Capital and Income    
Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders and the   
amounts earned by the Trustee are retained by the Trustee. Part of the Trustee's
compensation for its services to the Trust is expected to result from the use of
these funds.                                                                    

Compensation of Sponsor, Evaluator and Supervisor. The Sponsor and the    
Supervisor, which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee   
for providing bookkeeping and administrative services and portfolio supervisory 
services set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part   
One. These fees may exceed the actual costs of providing these services to the  
Trust but at no time will the total amount received for these services rendered 
to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts in any calendar year exceed the        
aggregate cost of providing these services in that year. The Evaluator will     
receive the annual fee for providing evaluation services set forth under        
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One.                       

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be    
incurred by the Trust: (a) normal expenses (including the cost of mailing       
reports to Unitholders) incurred in connection with the operation of the Trust, 
(b) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (c) expenses of the Trustee 
(including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel designated by the        
Sponsor, (d) various governmental charges, (e) expenses and costs of any action 
taken by the Trustee to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of       
Unitholders, (f) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or      
expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust without negligence, bad    
faith or wilful misconduct on its part, (g) foreign custodial and transaction   
fees, (h) costs associated with liquidating the securities held in the Trust,   
(i) any offering costs incurred after the end of the initial offering period and
(j) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of the     
Trust. The Trust may pay the expenses of updating its registration statement    
each year.

RISK FACTORS 

  Price Volatility. Because the Trust invests in common stocks, you should
understand the risks of investing in common stocks before purchasing Units.     
These risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the 
general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks    
(and therefore Units) will fall. Common stocks are especially susceptible to    
general stock market movements. The value of common stocks often rises or falls 
rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies     
change. These perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding 
government economic policies, inflation, interest rates, economic expansion or  
contraction, political climates and economic or banking crises. The value of    
Units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the Trust and may be more  
or less than the price you originally paid for your Units. As with any          
investment, we cannot guarantee that the performance of the Trust will be       
positive over any period of time. Because the Trust is not actively managed, the
Trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in 
managed investments.                                                            

     Dividends. Common stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are
not obligations of the company. Accordingly, common stockholders have a right to
receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of          
creditors, bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company. This means that
common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a company's board 
of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all
of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders. If a company issues   
additional debt securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities   
will have a claim against the company's assets before common stockholders if the
company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common     
stock was issued first. As a result, the company may be less willing or able to 
declare or pay dividends on its common stock.                                   

   Financial Services. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with
an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the bank, insurance and  
financial services sector in general.                                           

Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse   
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly     
dependent on net interest margin. Bank profits have come under pressure as net  
interest margins have contracted. There is no certainty that such conditions    
will continue. Banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a 
result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets. As initial home purchasing
and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and  
other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in the real estate   
markets, which have been weak in the past, can have a substantial effect upon   
banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans   
secured by real estate. Banks and their holding companies are subject to        
extensive federal regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to
state regulation as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements   
and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may  
pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in         
connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may             
substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if
deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the    
safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as       
increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases 
in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the   
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings  
and the ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of     
deposits nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or         
profitability of banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk  
of investment in the securities issued by such institutions.                    

The statutory requirements applicable to, and regulatory supervision of,  
banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have         
undergone substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes  
are embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,
enacted in August 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. The impact of    
these laws on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Securities 
in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The                
Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial services overhaul legislation allows banks,        
securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial             
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors.
This legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened 
competition among existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to    
liberalize interstate banking has been enacted in recent years. Under the       
legislation, banks are able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any    
state. Since mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into      
branches. Consolidation may continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Financial Accounting Standards Board require the expanded use of market     
value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for
investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale. Adoption  
of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported     
health of the industry, and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such    
problems. Additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For 
example, the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to   
the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and
there can be no certainty as to the effect, if any, that such changes would have
on the Securities in the Trust's portfolio. In addition, from time to time the  
deposit insurance system is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and    
proposed reforms of that system could, among other things, further restrict the 
ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount 
or number of deposits insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce      
profitability, as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become
more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank         
deposits. Banks face significant competition from other financial institutions  
such as mutual funds, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance   
companies, and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of  
regional and national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such     
legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously
prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into  
one unit. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to    
what, if any, manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or  
what ultimate effect such actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.          

The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank   
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by 
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash     
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of       
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and        
acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to
the effect, if any, such laws will have on the Securities or whether such       
approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.                                      

Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are   
subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates,  
and competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes  
in the direction of the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health 
of customers, equity transaction volume, the level and direction of interest    
rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial  
stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies. Additionally,       
competitive pressures, including increased competition with new and existing    
competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need 
for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the 
profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage          
industries. Companies involved in investment management and brokerage activities
are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and             
self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in 
the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could adversely affect   
the stock prices of such companies.                                             

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including but not limited to interest rate movements, the imposition of premium 
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,      
competition and pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other     
natural or man-made disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual     
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the 
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject 
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate  
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or       
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy 
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit  
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of     
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology 
and the pressure to compete globally.                                           

In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the    
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors, 
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:           

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
       property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
         could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
  material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;                                                  

o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be   
          expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
         have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;                                

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
   property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;          

  o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
        appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
  light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
         insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;        

    o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;

    o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
   value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and              

     o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.         

   The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come under
increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered or   
enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance regulators  
are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on        
insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new
laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the  
condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine whether to
promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to predict      
whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or
scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any, such     
legislation would have on the industry.                                         

All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that    
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of  
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as         
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some    
instances, would require divestiture.                                           

     Utility Issuers. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of the public utility industry and the     
risks which such an investment may entail. General problems of the public       
utility industry include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on      
invested capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by 
the public service commissions having jurisdiction, the difficulty in financing 
large construction programs during an inflationary period, the restrictions on  
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental, nuclear 
safety and other regulatory considerations, the difficulty of the capital       
markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities, the difficulty in         
obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, regulatory         
restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the     
retail and business customer, and the effects of energy conservation. There is  
no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the   
future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating 
and other expenses and debt service requirements. All of the public utilities   
which are issuers of the Securities have been experiencing many of these        
problems in varying degrees. Furthermore, utility stocks are particularly       
susceptible to interest rate risk, generally exhibiting an inverse relationship 
to interest rates. As a result, electric utility stock prices may be adversely  
affected as interest rates rise. Similarly, the success of certain companies is 
tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with       
intense competition between companies. There can be no assurance that these     
customers will place additional orders, or that an issuer of Securities will    
obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers.         
Accordingly, a decline in demand of such products, technologies or from such    
customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the Securities.    

  Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, for example, establish the rates which may be charged and the
appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base, which must be approved by 
the state commissions. Certain utilities have had difficulty from time to time  
in persuading regulators, who are subject to political pressures, to grant rate 
increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment. Any unexpected
limitations could negatively affect the profitability of utilities whose budgets
are planned far in advance. In addition, gas pipeline and distribution companies
have had difficulties in adjusting to short and surplus energy supplies,        
enforcing or being required to comply with long-term contracts and avoiding     
litigation with their customers, on the one hand, or suppliers, on the other. In
2001, two California public electric utilities claimed inability to meet their  
obligations to their suppliers in the deregulated wholesale market for          
electricity due to regulatory restrictions on their ability to pass increasing  
costs along to their customers in the retail market. These defaults led their   
wholesale suppliers to threaten to institute involuntary bankruptcy proceedings 
against the utility companies. Subsequently, one of the utility companies filed 
a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code of 
1978. Furthermore, regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and
other pressures, may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting  
or operational policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's        
profitability and its stock price. In late 2001, a trader and marketer of       
utilities, commodities and financial and risk management services filed a       
voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 as a result of being negatively  
impacted by several of these and other factors.                                 

Certain of the issuers of the Securities may own or operate nuclear   
generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review    
existing, and impose additional, requirements governing the licensing,          
construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear generating projects 
in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases,   
construction delays and licensing difficulties. These have been caused by       
various factors, including inflation, high financing costs, required design     
changes and rework, allegedly faulty construction, objections by groups and     
governmental officials, limits on the ability to finance, reduced forecasts of  
energy requirements and economic conditions. This experience indicates that the 
risk of significant cost increases, delays and licensing difficulties remain    
present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear 
project. Also, nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned   
outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new     
regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining  
regulatory approval to return to service. A major accident at a nuclear plant   
anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation, 
construction or licensing of nuclear units.                                     

 In view of the uncertainties discussed above, there can be no assurance
that any utility company's share of the full cost of nuclear units under        
construction ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a     
company could earn an adequate return on its investment in such units. The      
likelihood of a significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of    
concern described above varies, as does the potential severity of any adverse   
impact. It should be recognized, however, that one or more of such adverse      
events could occur and individually or collectively could have a material       
adverse impact on a company's financial condition, the results of its           
operations, its ability to make interest and principal payments on its          
outstanding debt or to pay dividends.                                           

  Other general problems of the electric, gas and water utility industries
(including state and local joint action power agencies) include rising costs of 
rail transportation to transport fossil fuels, the uncertainty of transmission  
service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions, changes in tax   
laws which adversely affect a utility's ability to operate profitably, increased
competition in service costs, recent reductions in estimates of future demand   
for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country, restrictions on        
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental          
considerations, uncertain availability and increased cost of capital,           
unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, including  
the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with conversion to       
alternate fuel sources such as coal, availability and cost of natural gas for   
resale, technical and cost factors and other problems associated with           
construction, licensing, regulation and operation of nuclear facilities for     
electric generation, including, among other considerations, the problems        
associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive
wastes, and the effects of energy and environmental conservation efforts. Each  
of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of
any Securities to make dividend payments and the value of such Securities on    
redemption of your Units.                                                       

Real Estate Investment Trusts. The Trust will invest in shares issued by  
REITs, domestic corporations or business trusts which invest primarily in income
producing real estate or real estate related loans or mortgages. REITs are      
financial vehicles that have as their objective the pooling of capital from a   
number of investors in order to participate indirectly in real estate ownership 
or financing. Thus, an investment in the Trust will be subject to risks similar 
to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate, in addition to    
securities markets risks, because of the Trust's investment in the securities of
companies in the real estate industry. These risks include:                     

o    declines in the value of real estate;                            

o    illiquidity of real property investments;                        

 o    risks related to general U.S. and global as well as local economic
conditions;                                                 

o    dependency on management skill;                                  

o    heavy cash flow dependency;                                      

o    possible lack of availability of mortgage funds;                 

o    excessive levels of debt or overleveraged financial structure;   

o    overbuilding;                                                    

o    extended vacancies, or obsolescence, of properties;              

o   increase in competition;                                          

o   increases in property taxes and operating expenses;               

o   changes in zoning laws;                                           

o   losses due to costs resulting from the clean-up of environmental  
problems;                                                     

 o   liability to third parties for damages resulting from environmental
problems;                                                     

o   casualty or condemnation losses;                                  

o   natural or man-made disasters;                                    

o   economic or regulatory impediments to raising rents;              

o   changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand;                  

o   changes in the appeal of properties to tenants; and               

o   changes in interest rates, tax rates or operating expenses.       

   In addition to these risks, equity REITs may be more likely to be affected by
changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts. Further,   
REITs are dependent upon the management skills of the issuers and generally may 
not be diversified.                                                             

  The above factors may also adversely affect a borrower's or lessee's ability
to meet its obligations to the REIT. In the event of a default by a borrower or 
lessee, the REIT may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or
lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its           
investments.                                                                    

 A significant amount of the assets of a REIT may be invested in investments
in specific geographic areas or in specific property types, e.g., hotels,       
shopping malls, residential complexes, and office buildings. The impact of      
economic conditions on REITs also varies with geographic location and property  
type. Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in   
terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate         
generally and REITs in particular. In addition, you should be aware that REITs  
may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects. REITs
are also subject to                                                             

o    defaults by borrowers,                                           

o    the market's perception of the REIT industry generally,          

 o    the possibility of failing to qualify for tax-free pass-through of
income under the Internal Revenue Code, and                 

   o    the possibility of failing to maintain exemption from the Investment
Company Act of 1940.                                        

  A default by a borrower or lessee may cause the REIT to experience delays in
enforcing its rights as mortgagee or lessor and to incur significant costs      
related to protecting its investments.                                          

Some REITs in the Trust may be structured as UPREITs. An UPREIT owns an   
interest in a partnership that owns real estate. This can result in a potential 
conflict of interest between (1) shareholders of the REIT who may want to sell  
an asset and (2) other partnership interest holders who would be subject to tax 
liability if the REIT sells the property. In some cases, REITs have entered into
"no sell" agreements, which are designed to avoid taxing the holders of         
partnership units by preventing the REIT from selling the property. This        
arrangement may mean that the REIT would refuse a lucrative offer for an asset  
or be forced to hold on to a poor asset. Since parties to "no sell" agreements  
often do not disclose them, the Sponsor does not know whether any of the REITs  
in the Trust have entered into this kind of arrangement.                        

A REIT generally maintains comprehensive insurance on presently owned and 
subsequently acquired real property assets, including (1) liability, (2) fire   
and (3) extended coverage. However, there are certain types of losses, generally
of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes and floods, that may be           
uninsurable or not economically insurable, as to which the REIT's properties are
at risk in their particular locales. The management of a REIT uses its          
discretion in determining (1) amounts, (2) coverage limits and (3) deductibility
provisions of insurance. They generally aim to acquire appropriate insurance on 
their investments at reasonable costs and on suitable terms. This may result in 
insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be       
sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of  
the lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances,       
environmental considerations, and several other factors might make it unfeasible
to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or    
destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds that a REIT receives
might not be adequate to restore its economic position with respect to that     
property.                                                                       

Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be    
liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances 
on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability (1) whether or  
not the owner or operator caused or knew of the presence of the hazardous or    
toxic substances and (2) whether or not the storage of the substances was in    
violation of a tenant's lease. In addition, (1) the presence of hazardous or    
toxic substances, or (2) the failure to remediate the property properly, may    
hinder the owner's ability to borrow using that real property as collateral. We 
cannot give any assurance that one or more of the REITs in the Trust may not be 
currently liable or potentially liable for any of these costs in connection with
real estate assets they presently own or subsequently acquire while the shares  
of those REITs are held in the Trust.                                           

Consumer Staples. Your Trust may invest significantly in issuers that   
manufacture or sell consumer staples. The profitability of these companies will 
be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and   
consumer spending trends. Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a    
recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth,
less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real          
disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both  
consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending  
habits. Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or
reduced market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials 
costs, an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

Industrials. Your Trust may invest significantly in industrials companies.
General risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy,
intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess 
capacity and consumer spending trends. In addition, capital goods companies may 
also be significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic     
cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply  
of key materials, labor relations, government regulations, government contracts 
and e-commerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the      
industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may
have led to the overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in
the industry may face similar scrutiny.                                         

  Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction equipment manufacturers.

   Health Care Issuers. An investment in Units of your Trust should be made with
an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the healthcare industry  
in general. Health care companies involved in advanced medical devices and      
instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care, hospital management/health        
services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the
healthcare field. These companies are subject to governmental regulation of     
their products and services, a factor which could have a significant and        
possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or   
services. Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition   
from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent        
protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological  
advances will render their products obsolete. The research and development costs
of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy governmental  
review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market.   
Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for      
several years. Such companies may also have persistent losses during a new      
product's transition from development to production, and revenue patterns may be
erratic.                                                                        

Legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in Congress from 
time to time. These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and   
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription      
drugs), national health insurance, incentives for competition in the provision  
of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare      
insurance premiums and promotion of pre-paid healthcare plans. The Sponsor and  
the Underwriter are unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if  
enacted, on the issuers of Securities in your Portfolio.                        

     Energy Issuers. Energy companies face risks related to political conditions
in oil producing regions (such as the Middle East), the actions of the          
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the price and worldwide   
supply of oil and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, 
the ability to find and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically      
recoverable, operating hazards, government regulation and the level of consumer 
demand. Political conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in
the past. Political instability or war in these regions could have a negative   
impact on your investment. Oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile.
OPEC controls a substantial portion of world oil production. OPEC may take      
actions to increase or suppress the price or availability of oil. Various       
domestic and foreign government authorities and international cartels also      
impact these prices. Any substantial decline in these prices could have an      
adverse effect on energy companies. Energy companies depend on their ability to 
find and acquire additional energy reserves. The exploration and recovery       
process involves significant operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy
company has no assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves will be
economically recoverable. The industry also faces substantial government        
regulation, including environmental regulation. These regulations have increased
costs and limited production and usage of certain fuels. Furthermore, certain   
companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged         
accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their       
financial results, and other companies in the industry may face similar         
scrutiny.                                                                       

Technology companies. The market for technology products and services,
especially those related to the Internet, is characterized by rapidly changing  
technology, rapid products obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving     
industry standards and frequent new product introductions. The success of       
technology companies depends in substantial part on the timely and success      
introduction of new products. An unexpected change in one or more of the        
technologies affecting an issuer's products or in the market for products based 
on a particular technology could have a material adverse affect on an issuer's  
operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that companies will be
able to respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace.        

The market for certain technology products and services may have only 
recently begun to develop, is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an       
increasing number of market entrants. Additionally, certain technology companies
may have only recently commenced operations or offered equity securities to the 
public. Such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited 
operating history on which to analyze future operating results. It is important 
to note that following its initial public offering, a security is likely to     
experience substantial stock price volatility and speculative trading.          
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, upon redemption of your Units or   
termination of the Trust, you will receive an amount greater than or equal to   
your initial investment.                                                        

    Based on trading history, factors such as announcements of new products or
development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have     
caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to  
fluctuate substantially. In addition, technology company stocks have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the     
operating performance of such companies. This market volatility may adversely   
affect the market price of the Securities and therefore your ability to redeem  
your Units, or roll over your Units into a new trust, at a price equal to or    
greater than the original price paid for such Units.                            

     Some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently
available only from a single source. There can be no assurance that in the      
future suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and 
cost effective manner. Accordingly, an issuer's operating results and customer  
relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for, or
any interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components. Additionally,   
many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base
consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product       
vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards.   
Any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or   
reduction of sales. Because many products and technology are incorporated into  
other related products, certain companies are often highly dependent on the     
performance of other computer, electronics and communications companies. There  
can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that  
an issuer of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders  
from other customers. Similarly, the success of certain companies is tied to a  
relatively small concentration of products or technology with intense           
competition between companies. Accordingly, a decline in demand for such        
products or technology from such customers could have a material adverse impact 
on issuers of the Securities.                                                   

  The life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short,
resulting in volatile sales, earnings and stock prices for many technology      
companies. Additionally, with the rapid evolution of technologies, competitive  
advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls.            
Historically, many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the       
consumer, as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or       
pricing power. Some of the large technology companies have been involved in     
antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future. A slowdown in        
corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company
revenues. Technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part
of their revenues. Any slowdown in international economies could hurt revenues. 

Consumer Cyclicals. The success of companies in the consumer cyclicals
sector depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and 
is subject to severe competition. Therefore, the success of consumer cyclicals  
companies is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international  
economy, and to interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. A slowdown 
in the economy would likely hurt the consumer cyclicals industry. The success of
companies in the consumer cyclicals segment are also strongly affected by       
changes in demographics and consumer tastes.                                    

Consumer Products. Your Trust may invest significantly in issuers that  
manufacture or sell consumer products. The profitability of these companies will
be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and   
consumer spending trends. Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a    
recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth,
less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real          
disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both  
consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending  
habits. Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or
reduced market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials 
costs, an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

   Telecommunications Issuers. Because the Portfolio is also concentrated in the
telecommunications industry, the value of the Units may be susceptible to       
factors affecting the telecommunications industry. The telecommunications       
industry is subject to governmental regulation, and the products and services of
telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence. These factors
could affect the value of Units. Telephone companies in the United States, for  
example, are subject to both state and federal regulations affecting permitted  
rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be offered. Certain types of
companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in fierce competition for a    
share of the market of their products. As a result, competitive pressures are   
intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility.                   

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications    
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

    While a portfolio concentrates on the securities of established suppliers of
traditional telecommunication products and services, the Trust may also invest  
in smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the development  
of new products and services. These smaller companies may present greater       
opportunities for capital appreciation, and may also involve greater risk than  
large, established issuers. Such smaller companies may have limited product     
lines, market or financial resources, and their securities may trade less       
frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger, more established
companies. As a result, the prices of the securities of such smaller companies  
may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of other        
issuers.                                                                        

In addition, recent federal legislation governing the United States     
telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional   
interpretation, which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are   
held by the Trust.                                                              

 Liquidity. Whether or not the stocks in the Trust are listed on a stock
exchange, the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an    
over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading market  
could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks. We cannot     
guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be liquid.
The value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or absent.    

  Voting. Only the Trustee may sell or vote the stocks in the Trust. While
you may sell or redeem your Units, you may not sell or vote the stocks in the   
Trust. The Sponsor will instruct the Trustee how to vote the stocks. The Trustee
will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by other     
shareholders if the Sponsor fails to provide instructions.                      

    No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in the Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

SPONSOR INFORMATION

relates only to the Sponsor and not to the Trust or to any other Series thereof.
The information is included herein only for the purpose of informing investors  
as to the financial responsibility of the Sponsor and its ability to carry out  
its contractual obligations. More detailed financial information will be made   
available by the Sponsor upon request).                                         

Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics    
requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust        
transactions to report personal securities transactions. This code is intended  
to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or     
misconduct with respect to your Trust.                                          

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust as       
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

TRUSTEE INFORMATION                                                             

  The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under the
laws of the State of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit      
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, (800) 221-7668. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and  
examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the     
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    

   The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of Securities for the Trust portfolio.             

     In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books
of record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trust. Such     
records shall include the name and address of, and the number of Units of the   
Trust held by, every Unitholder. Such books and records shall be open to        
inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual business  
hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to  
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the Securities held in the Trust.               

    Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of its responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement by     
executing an instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The    
Trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to   
all Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified 
in such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon        
receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee
promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and
has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring    
Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a 
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee 
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes    
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or    
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee.            

    Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to  
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee   
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or  
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided   
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

TRUST TERMINATION                                                               

The Trust may be liquidated at any time by consent of Unitholders     
representing 66 2/3% of the Units of such Trust then outstanding or by the      
Trustee when the value of the Securities owned by the Trust, as shown by any    
evaluation, is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has     
exceeded $15,000,000). The Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event 
that a sufficient number of Units of the Trust not yet sold are tendered for    
redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of such Trust would be reduced 
to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time they were deposited 
in the Trust. If the Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold    
Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the    
entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement will terminate  
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held thereunder, but in 
no event will it continue beyond the Mandatory Termination Date.                

    Commencing during the period beginning nine business days prior to, and no
later than, the Mandatory Termination Date, Securities may begin to be sold in  
connection with the termination of the Trust. The Sponsor will determine the    
manner, timing and execution of the sales of the Securities. The Sponsor shall  
direct the liquidation of the Securities in such manner as to effectuate orderly
sales and a minimal market impact. In the event the Sponsor does not so direct, 
the Securities shall be sold within a reasonable period and in such manner as   
the Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. At least 30 days before   
the Mandatory Termination Date the Trustee will provide written notice of any   
termination to all Unitholders of the appropriate Trust and in the case of a    
Trust will include with such notice a form to enable Unitholders owning the     
minimum number of Units described in the Prospectus to request an in-kind       
distribution of the Securities. To be effective, this request must be returned  
to the Trustee at least five business days prior to the Mandatory Termination   
Date. On the Mandatory Termination Date (or on the previous business day if a   
holiday) the Trustee will deliver each requesting Unitholder's pro rata number  
of whole shares of the Securities in the Trust to the account of the            
broker-dealer or bank designated by the Unitholder at Depository Trust Company. 
The value of the Unitholder's fractional shares of the Securities will be paid  
in cash. Unitholders not requesting an in-kind distribution will receive a cash 
distribution from the sale of the remaining Securities within a reasonable time 
following the Mandatory Termination Date. Regardless of the distribution        
involved, the Trustee will deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs,
expenses, advances or indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including    
estimated compensation of the Trustee, costs of liquidation and any amounts     
required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other   
governmental charges. Any sale of Securities in the Trust upon termination may  
result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not 
required at such time. The Trustee will then distribute to each Unitholder of   
each Trust his pro rata share of the balance of the Income and Capital Accounts.

  Within 60 days of the final distribution Unitholders will be furnished a
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the   
Trustee in its sole discretion will determine that any amounts held in reserve  
are no longer necessary, it will make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the
same manner.                                                                    

                                                                       EMSPRO390

Summary of Essential Financial Information

 As of November 25, 2009
Sponsor: Van Kampen Funds Inc.
 Evaluator: Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc.
Supervisor: Van Kampen Asset Management (4) 
Trustee: The Bank of New York Mellon

The income, expense and distribution data set forth below have been       
calculated for Unitholders electing to receive monthly distributions.           
Unitholders choosing a different distribution plan (if available) will receive  
a slightly higher net annual interest income because of the lower Trustee's     
fees and expenses under such plan.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

  To the Unitholders of Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 51:

We have audited the accompanying statements of condition (including the   
analyses of net assets and the related portfolio schedules) of Long-Term        
Investment Grade Trust, Series 19 and Insured Income Trust, Series 115 (the     
"Trusts," included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 51) as 
of October 31, 2009, and the related statements of operations and changes in    
net assets for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2009,    
and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended     
October 31, 2009. These financial statements and financial highlights are the   
responsibility of management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on    
these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.        

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public    
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require     
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about        
whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material  
misstatement. The Trusts are not required to have, nor were we engaged to       
perform an audit of their internal control over financial reporting. Our audits 
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis  
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but   
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the        
Trusts' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no   
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence       
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing   
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures 
included confirmation of securities owned at October 31, 2009 by correspondence 
with The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of    
Long-Term Investment Grade Trust, Series 19 and Insured Income Trust, Series    
115 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 51) as of   
October 31, 2009, and the results of its operations and changes in net assets   
for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2009, and the       
financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended October 31,
2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America.

brokers who customarily deal in securities comparable to those held by the      
Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices for comparable securities, (3) by         
determining the value of the securities by appraisal or (4) by any combination  
of the above.                                                                   

Security Cost - The original cost to each of the Trusts (Long-Term        
Investment Grade Trust, Series 19 and Insured Income Trust, Series 115) was     
based on the determination by the Evaluator of the offering prices of the       
securities on the date of deposit (December 4, 2003). Since the valuation is    
based upon the bid prices, such Trusts (Long-Term Investment Grade Trust,       
Series 19 and Insured Income Trust, Series 115) recognized downward adjustments 
of $54,683 and $74,892, respectively, on the date of deposit resulting from the 
difference between the bid and offering prices. These downward adjustments were 
included in the aggregate amount of unrealized depreciation reported in the     
financial statements for each Trust for the period ended October 31, 2004.      

  Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit in each Trust based upon (1) the cash on hand in such Trust or monies in   
the process of being collected, (2) the securities in such Trust based on the   
value determined by the Evaluator and (3) interest accrued thereon, less        
accrued expenses of the Trust, if any.                                          

Federal Income Taxes - For a Trust with a Date of Deposit prior to August
22, 2006, such Trust has been structured to be treated as a grantor trust for   
federal income tax purposes. Thus, such a Trust will not be treated as a        
taxable entity for federal income tax purposes, and each Unitholder will be     
considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of such Trust.   
Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes. For a Trust   
with a Date of Deposit on or after August 22, 2006, each such Trust has elected 
and intends to qualify on a continuous basis for special income tax treatment   
as a "regulated investment company" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended. If such Trust so qualifies, as expected, it will not be subject to     
federal income tax on amounts distributed to Unitholders. Your Trust's Date of  
Deposit is listed above in the section entitled "Summary of Essential Financial 
Information". For a discussion of the federal tax status of income earned on    
Units, see "Federal Tax Status--Grantor Trusts" or "Federal Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies", as applicable, in Prospectus Part II.  

  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - ASC 740, Income Taxes (formerly
an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, FIN 48), clarifies the appropriate 
method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an           
enterprise's financial statements and provides related guidance. ASC 740 does   
not have a material effect on the net asset value, financial condition or       
results of operations of the Trust.                                             

Subsequent Events - Events or transactions that have occurred from the    
balance sheet date through the date of issuance are evaluated by the Sponsor.   

Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of    
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are       
reported on an identified cost basis.                                           

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO                                                              

Ratings - The source of all ratings, exclusive of those designated NR or *
is Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies ("Standard &      
Poor's"). Ratings marked * are by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's")   
as these securities are not rated by Standard & Poor's. NR indicates that the   
security is not rated by Standard & Poor's or Moody's. The ratings shown        
represent the latest published ratings of the securities. For a brief           
description of rating symbols and their related meanings, see "Description of   
Securities Ratings" in the Information Supplement.                              

Redemption Feature - There is shown under this heading the year in which  
each issue of the securities is initially or currently callable and the call    
price for that year. Each issue of securities continues to be callable at       
declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue 
discount securities which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price     
plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if 
applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. 
In addition, the securities may also be subject to redemption without premium   
at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if      
certain events occur.                                                           

"+" indicates that the security has a "make whole" call option and is     
redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a     
redemption price that is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of  
the securities, a "make whole" amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to   
the date of redemption. The "make whole" amount will generally be equal to the  
excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption 
of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest   
accrued to the date of redemption, that would have been payable if redemption   
had not been made, determined by discounting the remaining principal and        
interest at a specified rate (which varies from security to security and is     
generally equal to an average of yields on U.S. Treasury obligations with       
maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the security plus a premium   
rate) from the dates on which the principal amount of the securities being      
redeemed.                                                                       

"S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of
securities. "P.R." indicates a security has been prerefunded.

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued)                                                  

Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption     
pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed       
securities have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over     
par. To the extent that the securities were deposited in the Trust at a price   
higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a loss of 
capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units.     
Conversely, to the extent that the securities were acquired at a price lower    
than the redemption price, this will represent an increase in capital when      
compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Distributions    
will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise     
have been paid with respect to redeemed securities and there will be            
distributed to Unitholders the principal amount in excess of $1 per Unit        
semi-annually and any premium received on such redemption. However, should the  
amount available for distribution in the Principal Account exceed $10.00 per    
Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the Principal Account   
on the next succeeding monthly Distribution Date to holders of record on the    
related monthly Record Date. The estimated current return in this event may be  
affected by such redemptions. For the Federal tax effect on Unitholders of such 
redemptions and resultant distributions, see "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus 
Part II.                                                                        

 Insurance - Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of
all principal and interest on certain of the securities in the Trust may have   
been obtained by the Trust or by one of the Preinsured security Insurers (as    
indicated in the security name), however, certain other securities may not be   
insured. Such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the securities   
or the value of the Units. For securities covered under the Trust's insurance   
policy the insurance is effective only while securities thus insured are held   
in the Trust and the insurance premium, which is a Trust obligation, is paid on 
a monthly basis. The premium for insurance which has been obtained from various 
insurance companies by the issuer of the security involved is payable by the    
issuer.                                                                         

An Accounting and Auditing Guide issued by the American Institute of      
Certified Public Accountants states that, for financial reporting purposes,     
insurance coverage of the type acquired by the Trust does not have any          
measurable value in the absence of default of the underlying Bonds or           
indication of the probability of such default.                                  

  Fair Value Measurements - FASB Accounting Standards Codification, Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820") (formerly FASB statement 157),         
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about   
fair value measurements in financial statements for the Trust for fiscal years  
beginning after November 15, 2007. The various inputs that may be used to       
determine the value of the Trust's investments are summarized in the three      
levels presented below. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities 
are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in      
those securities.                                                               

Level 1 -- Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.      

Level 2 -- Prices determined using other significant observable inputs.   
Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in        
pricing a security, which may include quoted prices for similar securities,     
interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk.                              

Level 3 -- Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In    
certain situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable,    
unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust's own    
assumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing an       
investment, and would be based on the best information available.               

   The following table summarizes the Trust's investments as of October 31, 2009
based on the inputs used to value them:

NOTE 3 - OTHER                                                                  

Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends
to maintain a market for Units and to continuously offer to purchase Units at   
prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid price of    
the securities in the portfolio of the Trust, plus interest accrued to the date 
of settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for other business     
reasons, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. In the  
event that a market is not maintained for the Units, a Unitholder desiring to   
dispose of his Units may be able to do so only by tendering such Units to the   
Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.                                 

Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on the       
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate offering price of the securities per 
Unit on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a sales charge of 4.9% of the  
Public Offering Price which is equivalent to 5.152% of the aggregate offering   
price of the Bonds. The secondary market cost to investors is based on the      
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate bid price of the securities per Unit 
on the date of an investor's purchase plus a sales charge based upon the        
estimated long-term return life of the securities in the Trust. The sales       
charge ranges from 1.0% of the Public Offering Price (1.010% of the aggregate   
bid price of the securities) for a Trust with an estimated long-term return     
life with less than two years to 5.40% of the Public Offering Price (5.708% of  
the aggregate bid price of the securities) for a Trust with a portfolio with an 
estimated long-term return life of twenty-one or more years.                    

  Compensation of Evaluator and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.25 per Unit, not to   
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to the  
Trust). In addition, the Evaluator receives an annual fee for regularly         
evaluating the Trust's portfolio. Both fees may be adjusted for increases under 
the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index.

VAN KAMPEN 
INVESTMENTS 

THE TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Each Trust is a unit investment trust issued under the name Van  
Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series, Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Taxable  
Income Series, Van Kampen Merritt Insured Income Trust, Van Kampen American     
Capital Insured Income Trust, Van Kampen Insured Income Trust or Van Kampen     
Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust. Your Trust was created under the laws of 
the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust   
Agreement"), dated the Date of Deposit among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as Sponsor, 
Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, Van Kampen Asset  
Management, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, or their
predecessors.                                                                   

Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to       
participate in a portfolio of taxable fixed income securities with greater      
diversification than they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification
of a Trust's assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the  
ownership of bonds. In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the   
portfolio of a Trust are often not available in small amounts and may, in the   
case of any privately placed bonds, be available only to institutional          
investors.                                                                      

   On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited the bonds with the Trustee. The
bonds initially consisted of delivery statements relating to contracts for their
purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued 
by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, 
delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the Units. A Trust that holds 
primarily long-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is   
referred to herein as a "Long-Term Trust". A Trust that holds primarily         
intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is     
referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". A Trust that holds a        
portfolio of bonds with "laddered" maturities, as described on the cover of     
Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a "Laddered Trust". A Trust that    
holds only insured bonds is referred to herein as an "Insured Trust". Unless    
otherwise terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will terminate at  
the end of the calendar year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of its execution 
in the case of a Long-Term Trust or a Laddered Trust and at the end of the      
calendar year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in the case of
an Intermediate-Term Trust.                                                     

   Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the
principal and net income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed  
by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in a Trust represented by each
Unit will increase, although the actual interest in a Trust will remain         
unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until 
the termination of the Trust Agreement.                                         

Objectives and Bond Selection. The objective of a Long-Term Trust is to   
provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally     
selected portfolio primarily consisting of long-term bonds. The objective of an 
Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by     
investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of        
intermediate-term bonds. The objective of a Laddered Trust is to provide income 
and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally selected portfolio 
consisting of bonds with laddered maturities of approximately 10, 15, 20, 25 and
30 years from the Date of Deposit. There is, of course, no guarantee that a     
Trust will achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an appropriate investment   
vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income  
bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire           
individually.                                                                   

In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following   
factors, among others: (a) with respect to Insured Trusts, the bonds must have a
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") rating of AAA or a Moody's Investors 
Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating of Aaa and with respect to all other trusts,   
the bonds must have an S&P rating of at least "BBB-", a Moody's rating of at    
least "Baa3" or, if not rated, credit characteristics sufficiently similar to   
those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition
by a Trust in the opinion of the Sponsor, (b) the prices of the bonds relative  
to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the current income       
provided by the bonds; (d) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue  
and location of issuer; (e) the probability of early return of principal or high
legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or 
its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. 
Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered 
in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to    
dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration"). In  
particular, the ratings of the bonds in an Investment Grade Trust or a Long-Term
Investment Grade Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-"  
or "Baa3") during the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the     
bonds. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors".                                          

Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and 
interest on the bonds in certain Trusts has been obtained from a bond insurance 
company. For information relating to insurance on the bonds, see "Insurance on
the Bonds in an Insured Trust". Neither the Public Offering Price nor any       
evaluation of Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects any     
element of value for the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust unless bonds are
in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such   
default. See "Public Offering--Unit Price".                                     

In order for bonds to be eligible for insurance, they must have credit    
characteristics which would qualify them for at least the S&P rating of "BBB-"  
or at least the Moody's rating of "Baa3", which in brief represent the lowest   
ratings for securities of investment grade (see "Description of Ratings" in the 
Information Supplement). Insurance is not a substitute for the basic credit of  
an issuer, but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security.
If an issue is accepted for insurance, a non-cancelable policy for the prompt   
payment of interest and principal on the bonds, when due, is issued by the      
insurer. A monthly premium is paid by a Trust for the insurance obtained by it. 
The Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from a Portfolio Insurer
in connection with the sale of a bond insured under the insurance policy        
obtained from the respective Portfolio Insurer by a Trust upon the payment of a 
single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such    
bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust is eligible to be sold on an    
insured basis. All bonds insured by a Portfolio Insurer or by a Preinsured Bond 
Insurer receive a "AAA" rating by S&P. S&P describes securities it rates "AAA"  
as having "the highest rating assigned by S&P to a debt obligation. Capacity to 
pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong." See "Insurance on the
Bonds in an Insured Trust".                                                     

Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand   
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of    
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one   
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a  
more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment.                   

Current economic conditions. The markets for credit instruments, including
corporate bonds and municipal securities, have experienced periods of extreme   
illiquidity and volatility since the latter half of 2007. The current economic  
environment has made conditions difficult for virtually all industries and      
companies to operate in an efficient manner. General market uncertainty and     
consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers,  
which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety 
of debt securities. These conditions resulted, and in many cases continue to    
result in, greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a    
lack of price transparency, with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of 
uncertain value. These market conditions may make valuation of some of the      
Trust's bonds uncertain and/or result in sudden and significant valuation       
increases or declines in its holdings.                                          

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will    
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise 
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are
often more sensitive to interest rate changes.                                  

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                            

Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original 
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to 
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to  
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less   
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par   
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your 
units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate     
early. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or
mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax   
laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the    
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other events.
The call provisions are described in general terms in Prospectus Part I.        
Additional discussion of call provisions appears in the Information Supplement. 

Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating  
agency decreases the bond's rating.                                             

Bond concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified   
because it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of    
bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be             
"concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are described in the 
following sections.                                                             

Extension risk is the chance that an increase in interest rates or lack of
refinancing opportunities can cause a corresponding increase in the Trust's life
due to a drop in expected prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. As a       
result, the securities in your Trust may become more sensitive to rising        
interest rates and may decrease in value.                                       

  Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could        
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

 Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent, thereby adversely affecting the Trust's net asset
value. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond
because these bonds generally trade in the over-the-counter market (they are not
listed on a securities exchange). Because of the difficulties currently being   
experienced by many companies in the financial services industry, many markets  
are experiencing substantially reduced liquidity. As a result of such           
illiquidity, the Trustee may have to sell other or additional bonds if necessary
to satisfy redemption requests.                                                 

 Insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could
lose income and/or principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond  
both default in making their payment obligations.                               

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or     
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an 
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.                          

 Taxable Municipal Bonds. Your Trust may invest significantly or exclusively
in taxable municipal bonds. States, municipalities and public authorities issue 
these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes. In selecting bonds, the   
Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose. This section briefly 
describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment.   
The types of bonds in your portfolio are listed in Prospectus Part I. These     
bonds are also described in greater detail in the Information Supplement.       

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the    
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or  
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

 Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

 Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease     
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from     
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and claims, and     
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

 Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of
college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,         
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

   Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or improving
industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these projects. The   
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as
the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project, revenues         
generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or other    
regulatory restrictions.                                                        

Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally         
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.    

Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from  
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or 
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate         
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

 Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

 Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

 Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on
variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from     
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail
and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes
and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers
that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                         

Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from 
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

   Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to make    
payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for     
electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and
rate approvals.                                                                 

  State Risk Factors. Your Trust may invest significantly in taxable municipal
bonds of issuers from a particular state. The financial condition of a state may
be affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and
conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by constitutional amendments,     
legislative measures, or voter initiatives on a state and its local governments 
concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain the         
revenue-generating capacity of the state and its local governments and,         
therefore, the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their obligations.

  The economic vitality of a state and its various regions and, therefore, the
ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds, are        
affected by numerous factors, such as natural disasters, complications with     
exports and industry deregulation.                                              

A state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final     
decision could materially affect the state's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. Your Trust may invest
significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell various     
consumer products. General risks of these companies include the general state of
the economy, intense competition and consumer spending trends. A decline in the 
economy which results in a reduction of consumers' disposable income can        
negatively impact spending habits. Competitiveness in the retail industry will  
require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout        
equipment to control inventory, track the sale of items and gauge the success of
sales campaigns. Retailers who sell their products over the Internet have the   
potential to access more consumers, but will require sophisticated technology to
remain competitive. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect 
the demand for, and the success of, consumer products and services in the       
marketplace.                                                                    

Financial Services Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds  
issued by financial services companies. Any negative impact on this industry    
will have a greater impact on the value of Units than on a portfolio diversified
over several industries. You should understand the risks of this industry before
you invest.                                                                     

The effects of the sub-prime mortgage crisis that began to unfold in 2007 
continue to manifest in nearly all the subdivisions of the financial services   
industry. Sub-prime mortgage related losses and write downs among investment    
banks and similar institutions reached significant levels in 2008. The impact of
these losses among traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and      
insurers has forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation 
or combination, while drastically increasing the credit risk, and possibility of
default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles. Many of
the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance   
their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital. In    
some cases, the U.S. government has acted to bail out or provide support to     
select institutions, however the risk of default by such issuers has nonetheless
increased substantially.                                                        

   While the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve Board and Congress
have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with financial
institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated with          
investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result of   
these steps.                                                                    

Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse   
effects of economic recession; volatile interest rates; portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans; and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. In addition, banks   
and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and   
state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulation. Bank         
profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital      
funds, and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to     
increased competition. Economic conditions in the real estate markets have      
deteriorated and have had a substantial negative effect upon banks because they 
generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real      
estate.                                                                         

Banks face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as   
regulatory changes, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act financial services       
overhaul legislation, permitting new entrants to offer various financial        
products. Technological advances such as the Internet allow these nontraditional
lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer   
data. Banks continue to face tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage   
firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish       
services that were traditionally offered by banks.                              

 Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the 
volatility of the securities markets in general. Adverse changes in the         
direction of the securities markets, investor confidence, equity transaction    
volume, the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging   
markets could adversely affect the financial stability of these companies.      
Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition with new   
and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses 
and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could         
adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management   
and brokerage industries. Companies involved in investment management and       
broker-dealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government 
agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or 
rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could       
adversely affect such companies.                                                

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a       
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and   
pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other disasters and the   
effects of client mergers. Already extensively regulated, insurance companies'  
profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulations or tax law
changes.                                                                        

 Health Care Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
health care companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced     
medical devices and instruments, drugs and biotechnology, managed care, hospital
management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face           
substantial government regulation and approval procedures. Legislative proposals
concerning health care are proposed in Congress from time to time. These        
proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and price controls (which 
might include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs), national health    
insurance, incentives for competition in the provision of health care services, 
tax incentives and penalties related to health care insurance premiums and      
promotion of pre-paid health care plans. The government could also reduce       
funding for health care related research. The Sponsor is unable to predict the  
effect of any of these proposals, if enacted, on the issuers of Securities in   
your Portfolio.                                                                 

Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing      
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of   
patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a       
product will never come to market. The research and development costs of        
bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial. This process  
involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval. These         
companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years,
if at all. The failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a    
substantial negative impact on a company and its stock. The goods and services  
of health care issuers are also subject to risks of product liability           
litigation.                                                                     

   Health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services, the
ability of the facility to provide required services, confidence in the         
facility, management capabilities, competition, efforts by insurers and         
government agencies to limit rates, expenses, the cost and possible             
unavailability of malpractice insurance, and termination or restriction of      
government financial assistance (such as Medicare, Medicaid or similar          
programs).                                                                      

 Industrials Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
industrials companies. General risks of industrials companies include the       
general state of the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and  
international politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. Capital   
goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending  
and leverage levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in         
modernization, limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations,         
government regulations, government contracts and e-commerce initiatives.        
Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their    
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, labor disputes, changes in government budget       
priorities, changes in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable    
business travel. The number of housing starts, levels of public and             
non-residential construction including weakening demand for new office and      
retail space, and overall construction spending may adversely affect            
construction materials and equipment manufacturers.                             

  Information Technology Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by information technology companies. These companies include companies   
that are involved in computer and business services, enterprise                 
software/technical software, Internet and computer software, Internet-related   
services, networking and telecommunications equipment, telecommunications       
services, electronics products, server hardware, computer hardware and          
peripherals, semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductors. These companies
face risks related to rapidly changing technology, rapid product obsolescence,  
cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent new product  
introductions. An unexpected change in technology can have a significant        
negative impact on a company. The failure of a company to introduce new products
or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology, can have a       
negative impact on the company's results. Information technology securities tend
to experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading.             
Announcements about new products, technologies, operating results or marketing  
alliances can cause securities prices to fluctuate dramatically. At times,      
however, extreme price and volume fluctuations are unrelated to the operating   
performance of a company. This can impact your ability to redeem your Units at a
price equal to or greater than what you paid.                                   

Telecommunications Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds  
issued by telecommunications companies. These companies are subject to          
substantial governmental regulation. For example, the United States government  
and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of       
services that a company may offer. This industry has experienced substantial    
deregulation in recent years. Deregulation may lead to fierce competition for   
market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies. Recent federal
legislation governing the United States telecommunications industry remains     
subject to judicial review and additional interpretation, which may adversely   
affect the companies whose securities are held by your Trust. Competitive       
pressures are intense and values of telecommunications company securities can   
experience rapid volatility. Certain telecommunications products may become     
outdated very rapidly. A company's performance can be hurt if the company fails 
to keep pace with technological advances.                                       

  Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have
illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies. 
High debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the   
1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt and stock prices to trade at
distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost 
of capital for needed additional investment. At the same time, demand for some  
telecommunications services has fallen sharply, as several key markets have     
become oversaturated, some local customers have switched to substitute providers
and technologies, and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak.  
To meet increasing competition, companies may have to commit substantial        
capital, particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new 
technologies. As a result, many companies have been compelled to cut costs by   
reducing their workforce, outsourcing, consolidating and/or closing existing    
facilities and divesting low selling product lines. Furthermore, certain        
companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged         
accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their       
financial results, and other companies in the industry may face similar         
scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of owning the          
securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may  
continue to rise.                                                               

Certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than  
larger, established issuers. Smaller companies may have limited product lines,  
markets or financial resources. Their securities may trade in lower volumes than
larger companies. As a result, the prices of these securities may fluctuate more
than the prices of securities of other issuers.                                 

Utility and Energy Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds  
issued by utility and energy companies or in companies related to the utility or
energy industries. Many utility and energy companies, especially electric and   
gas and other energy related utility companies, are subject to various          
uncertainties, including:                                                       

o    risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;            

    o    restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;     

  o    regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;            

o    coping with the general effects of energy conservation;          

    o    technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;                                       

o    the effects of local weather, maturing markets and difficulty in 
 expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors;

o    the potential impact of natural or man-made disasters;           

 o    difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
       frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;

o    the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;

o    difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities; and                                      

o    increased competition.                                           

Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the 
supply of or demand for electricity, natural gas, water or other energy, which  
could adversely affect the profitability of utility and energy company bond     
issuers and the performance of the your Trust.                                  

Utility and energy companies are subject to extensive regulation at the   
federal and state levels in the United States. At the federal level, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"), the Federal Trade Commission (the    
"FTC"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and the Nuclear     
Regulatory Commission (the "NRC") have authority to oversee electric and        
combination electric and gas utilities. The value of utility and energy company 
stocks may decline because governmental regulation controlling these industries 
can change. This regulation may prevent or delay the company from passing along 
cost increases to its customers which could hinder the company's ability to meet
its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures,      
including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary     
bankruptcy proceedings, by its creditors against such company. Furthermore,     
regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and other pressures,  
may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting or operational    
policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's profitability and its 
stock price. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial         
deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently more       
similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition 
and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original    
geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities 
may permit certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional        
regulated rates of return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend     
their core business and may be less profitable. Mergers in the these industries 
may require approval from several federal and state regulatory agencies,        
including FERC, the FTC, and the SEC. These regulatory authorities could, as a  
matter of policy, reverse the trend toward deregulation and make consolidation  
more difficult, or cause delay in the merger process, any of which could cause  
the prices of these stocks to fall.                                             

More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds, 
other information about the bonds is also listed in the "Portfolio" in          
Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the     
bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.            

Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.         

  Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type of
bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par   
value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during     
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

  "When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually
issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust "when,  
as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be delayed
or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your Trust 
until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to adjust your   
tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery
date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you   
purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your Trust. This could    
lower your first year estimated current return. You may experience gains or     
losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even though your Trust   
has not yet received them.                                                      

 No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Estimated Current Returns and the Estimated Long-Term Returns are set 
forth in the Prospectus Part I. Estimated Current Return is calculated by       
dividing the estimated net annual interest income per Unit by the Public        
Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest income per Unit will vary with
changes in fees and expenses of your Trust and with the principal prepayment,   
redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds. The Public Offering Price will 
vary with changes in the price of the bonds. Accordingly, there is no assurance 
that the present Estimated Current Return will be realized in the future.       
Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into   
consideration, and determines and factors in the relative weightings of, the    
market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and
the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of the bonds and (2) takes
into account the expenses and sales charge associated with Units. Since the     
value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a Trust will   
change, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Long-Term Return will  
be realized in the future. The Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term 
Return are expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term    
Return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the   
Estimated Current Return calculation includes only net annual interest income   
and Public Offering Price.                                                      

In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or 
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the
First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary  
to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from     
interest payments on the related bonds.                                         

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. The secondary market
public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds, the sales charge 
described below, cash, if any, in the Principal Account plus accrued interest,  
if any. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ      
slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the 
calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.  
The minimum purchase in the primary and secondary market is one Unit. Certain   
broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing 
Unit purchased.                                                                 

 The secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following
table based upon the estimated long-term return life ("ELTR Life") of your      
Trust's portfolio:

The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's     
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return. 
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds.   

 Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's       
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.    
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your broker-dealer of your       
qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a
reduced sales charge.                                                           

Fee Accounts. A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts
described in this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to the
portion of the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the
section called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these purchases.    
Units may be purchased in the initial offering period at the Public Offering    
Price less the maximum applicable concession the Sponsor typically allows to    
brokers and dealers for purchases by investors who purchase Units through       
registered investment advisers, certified financial planners and registered     
broker-dealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage       
services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, 
or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an investment  
account for which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed     
("Fee Accounts") if the Units are purchased for a Fee Account and the Trust is  
subject to a Wrap Fee (i.e. the Trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible"). The Sponsor      
reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of Units described in this        
paragraph by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is      
determined to be detrimental to a Trust.                                        

Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and 
children under 21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or     
fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its   
affiliates and dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public    
Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession. All employee discounts are
subject to the policies of the related selling firm. Only employees, officers   
and directors of companies that allow their employees to participate in this    
employee discount program are eligible for the discounts.                       

Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts 
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I  
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of Units  
on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales charge to  
the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of 
Units outstanding. This price determination was made on the basis of an         
evaluation of the bonds prepared by the Evaluator. During the initial offering  
period, the Evaluator will value the bonds as of the Evaluation Time on days the
New York Stock Exchange is open for business and will adjust the Public Offering
Price of Units accordingly. The "Evaluation Time" is the close of trading on the
New York Stock Exchange on each day that the Exchange is open for trading, or   
earlier on days where the Bond Market Association recommends an early bond      
market close, provided, however, on the Date of Deposit the Evaluation Time will
be the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the  
registration statement filed with the SEC becomes effective, if later. The      
secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will be equal to the aggregate  
bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and    
dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. For secondary market       
purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator as of the Evaluation   
Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary.
The offering price of bonds may be expected to range approximately from 0.125%  
to 1.375% more than the bid price. The Public Offering Price per Unit will be   
effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time on each business 
day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time and orders     
received by authorized financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that
are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time designated by the Sponsor,  
are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders received by the Sponsor after   
the Evaluation Time, and orders received by authorized financial professionals  
after the Evaluation Time or orders received by such persons that are not       
transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time designated by the Sponsor, are  
priced based on the date of the next determined Public Offering Price per Unit  
provided they are received timely by the Sponsor on such date. It is the        
responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit orders received
by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner.             

  The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or
offering prices, as is appropriate, (a) on the basis of current market prices   
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to    
those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are not available, on the basis of
current market prices for comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the     
bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting 
or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market  
prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest    
rates. Unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in    
significant risk of default, the Evaluator will not attribute any value to the  
insurance obtained by your Trust.                                               

 The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant
risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance guaranteeing 
interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will be equal to the
difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise
of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premiums and     
related expenses attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii)  
the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In      
addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of a Portfolio Insurer to meet
its commitments under any insurance policy, including commitments to issue      
Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by an     
Insured Trust, if any, as of the date of this prospectus.                       

A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

 Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although your Trust accrues   
interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount of interest    
earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with respect to   
sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate share of      
accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering Price of
Units of Series other than those described in the following two sections.       
Unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their Units on  
the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest which   
would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount of    
accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First     
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account     
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates  
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the    
amount of interest actually received by your Trust and distributed to           
Unitholders. If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he 
will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from
the purchaser of his Units.                                                     

Accrued Interest (Accrued Interest To Carry). Added to the Public Offering
Price of Units for Insured Income Trust, Series 34 and prior Series is accrued  
interest to carry. Accrued interest to carry consists of two elements. The first
element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of     
unpaid interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid. 
Interest on bonds in the Trust is actually paid either monthly or semi-annually 
to the Trust. However, interest on the bonds in the Trust is accounted for daily
on an accrual basis. Because of this, the Trust always has an amount of interest
earned but not yet collected by the Trustee because of coupons that are not yet 
due. For this reason, the Public Offering Price of Units will have added to it  
the proportionate share of accrued and undistributed interest to the date of    
settlement.                                                                     

The second element of accrued interest to carry arises because of the     
structure of the Interest Account. The Trustee has no cash for distribution to  
Unitholders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in a Trust. The    
Trustee is obligated to provide its own funds, at times, in order to advance    
interest distributions. The Trustee will recover these advancements when such   
interest is received. Interest Account balances are established so that it will 
not be necessary on a regular basis for the Trustee to advance its own funds in 
connection with such interest distributions. The Interest Account balances are  
also structured so that there will generally be positive cash balances and since
the funds held by the Trustee will be used by it to earn interest thereon, it   
benefits thereby. If the Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his    
Units or if the bonds in a Trust are sold or otherwise removed or if the Trust  
is liquidated, he will receive at that time his proportionate share of the      
accrued interest to carry computed to the settlement date in the case of sale or
liquidation and to the date of tender in the case of redemption.                

 Purchased and Accrued Interest. Added to the Public Offering Price of Units
for Insured Income Trust, Series 35-43 is Purchased Interest and accrued        
interest as described below.                                                    

Purchased Interest. Purchased Interest is a portion of the unpaid interest
that has accrued on the bonds from the later of the last payment date on the    
bonds or the date of issuance thereof through the First Settlement Date and is  
included in the calculation of the Public Offering Price. Purchased Interest    
will be distributed to Unitholders as Units are redeemed or bonds mature or are 
called. See "Summary Of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I   
for the amount of Purchased Interest per Unit for each Trust. Purchased Interest
is an element of the price Unitholders will receive in connection with the sale 
or redemption of Units prior to the termination of a Trust.                     

 Accrued Interest. Accrued Interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although a Trust accrues such 
interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an amount of interest earned
but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, the Public Offering Price
of Units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to   
the date of settlement. Unitholders will receive on the next distribution date  
of a Trust the amount, if any, of accrued interest paid on their Units. As      
indicated in "Purchased Interest", accrued interest as of the First Settlement  
Date includes Purchased Interest. In an effort to reduce the amount of Purchased
Interest which would otherwise have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee may  
advance a portion of such accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of  
record as of the First Settlement Date. Consequently, the amount of accrued     
interest to be added to the Public Offering Price of Units will include only    
accrued interest from the First Settlement Date to the date of settlement (other
than the Purchased Interest already included therein), less any distributions   
from the Interest Account subsequent to the First Settlement Date. See "Rights
of Unitholders--Distributions of Interest and Principal." Because of the varying
interest payment dates of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will 
be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a Trust and         
distributed to Unitholders. If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of
his Units, he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the        
Purchased Interest and accrued interest from the purchaser of his Units. Since  
the Trustee has the use of the funds (including Purchased Interest) held in the 
Interest Account for distributions to Unitholders and since such Account is     
non-interest-bearing to Unitholders, the Trustee benefits thereby.              

  Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by broker-dealers
and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest. The Sponsor     
intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states.                        

  Certain commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers on
an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal to
the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the      
banks. Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or
agent. For secondary market transactions, the Sponsor will sell Units to        
broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession
or agency commission of 80% of the applicable sales charge. Dealers other than  
the Sponsor may sell Units in the secondary market to other broker-dealers and  
selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency         
commission not in excess of the secondary market concession allowed to the      
dealer. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency  
commission to dealers and others from time to time.                             

Sponsor Compensation. Broker-dealers will receive a gross sales commission
equal to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved. See "Public
Offering--General". The Sponsor will receive from the broker-dealers the excess 
of this gross sales commission over the amounts set forth in the previous       
section.                                                                        

 In addition, the Sponsor may have realized a profit or loss, as a result of
the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the Sponsor and the cost 
of the bonds to a Trust. The Sponsor or its affiliates may also have realized   
profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the Sponsor from 
underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has not         
participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the            
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds in a Trust were acquired. The      
Sponsor may further realize profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations 
in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of 
Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed, if any) will 
be retained by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will also realize profits or losses in  
the amount of any difference between the price at which Units are purchased and 
the price at which Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary  
market for Units and will also realize profits or losses resulting from a       
redemption of repurchased Units at a price above or below the purchase price.   

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional 
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of a Trust and our   
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of  
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related         
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of a Trust and our other products. Fees may include
payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection with     
trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars of a 
business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for your  
Units.                                                                          

Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to 
maintain a market for Units and offer to purchase Units at prices, subject to   
change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus       
accrued interest and any principal cash on hand, less any amounts representing  
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of your Trust and less any      
accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of Units exceeds demand or if some other  
business reason warrants it, the Sponsor may either discontinue all purchases of
Units or discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not     
maintained and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will  
be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at  
the Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A       
Unitholder who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to
current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in    
excess of the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will 
notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid  
in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per 
Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would 
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions of Interest and Principal. Interest received by your Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless a Unitholder elects
to receive quarterly or semi-annual distributions. Certain Trusts do not offer  
all distribution options. Please refer to Prospectus Part I. The plan of        
distribution selected by a Unitholder will remain in effect until changed.      
Unitholders who purchase Units in the secondary market will receive             
distributions in accordance with the election of the prior owner. Unitholders   
may change their distribution plan by indicating the change on a card which may 
be obtained from the Trustee and return the card to the Trustee with their      
certificates and other documentation required by the Trustee. Certificates      
should be sent by registered or certified mail to avoid their being lost or     
stolen. If the card and certificate are properly presented to the Trustee, the  
change will become effective on the first day after the next semi-annual record 
date and will remain effective until changed.                                   

 Interest received by your Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee, without
interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of 
record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be distributed on
each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date.
All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. Funds in the Principal     
Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee is not       
required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or Interest Account (but
may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these   
funds) nor to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the amount  
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit. However,
should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or  
exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the   
Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record
on the related monthly record date.                                             

Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate  
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the
second distribution date after the purchase, under the applicable plan of       
distribution.                                                                   

Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee, at its Unit Investment Trust Division, 111 Sanders Creek 
Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, of the certificates representing the    
Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of     
transfer with signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, such
as in connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of 
applicable governmental charges, if any. Redemption of Units cannot occur until 
certificates representing the Units or satisfactory indemnity have been received
by the Trustee. No later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender,
the Unitholder will receive an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption     
Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of the tender of      
Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received
by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the Evaluation Time 
on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the    
next day on which that Exchange is open and the Units will be deemed to have    
been tendered to the Trustee on that day for redemption at the Redemption Price.
Redemption requests received by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and      
redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals after the    
Evaluation Time or redemption requests received by such persons that are not    
transmitted to the Trustee until after the time designated by the Trustee, are  
priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price provided they  
are received timely by the Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of    
authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by  
them to the Trustee so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain        
broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing 
redemption requests. Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not subject
to such fees.                                                                   

 Under Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") regulations, the Trustee is required
to withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not  
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such         
regulations or if the IRS notifies your Trust that such withholding is required.
Any amount withheld is transmitted to the IRS and may be recovered by the       
Unitholder only when filing a return or a claim for refund. Under normal        
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".           

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public     
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption    
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price  
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the   
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value 
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts        
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust      
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering Price". In determining the  
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance  
maintained on the bonds in a Trust unless the bonds are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a description of   
the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance obtained by a     
Trust, see "Public Offering--Offering Price". Accrued interest paid on          
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance      
therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be  
withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.     

   The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid by
the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented by   
the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When bonds 
are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may be    
required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in   
lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                                  

   The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary    
weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that trading on
that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of which        
disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for other 
periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme circumstances the 
Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full or partial          
suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.                   

In addition, with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series
119 and subsequent series, the Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any        
redemption of 1,000 or more Units with an aggregate redemption price of         
$1,000,000 or more in an in kind distribution of bonds. An in kind distribution 
of bonds will be made by the Trustee through the distribution of each of the    
bonds in the Trust in bookentry form to the account of the Unitholder's         
broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company. Amounts representing fractional      
portions of a bond will be distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the bonds
included in a Unitholder's in kind distribution to facilitate the distribution  
of whole bonds. Special tax consequences will result if a Unitholder receives an
in kind distribution. See "Tax Status".                                         

Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust   
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Van Kampen
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial        
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new 
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this 
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment    
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax          
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time. The exchange will     
generally be treated as a sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax 
purposes.                                                                       

   Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book entry form unless a Unitholder
makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in certificate form.   
Units are transferable by making a written request to the Trustee and, in the   
case of Units in certificate form, by presentation and surrender of the         
certificate to the Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written        
instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the written       
request, or certificate transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears on the 
records of the Trustee and on the face of any certificate with the signature    
guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program 
("STAMP") or a signature guaranty program accepted by the Trustee. The Trustee  
may require additional documents such as, but not limited to, trust instruments,
certificates of death, appointments as executor or administrator or certificates
of corporate authority. Certificates will be issued in denominations of one Unit
or any multiple thereof. Although no such charge is now made, the Trustee may   
require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee for each certificate re-issued or  
transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, stolen, mutilated or lost         
certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the Trustee of satisfactory      
indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred. Mutilated    
certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.                

  Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to 
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be      
audited annually by independent registered public accounting firm and the report
of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will furnish  
to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a statement     
describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual Trust       
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust information. 
Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the bonds upon     
request to the Trustee. If you have any questions regarding your account or your
Trust, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee. The Sponsor does   
not have access to individual account information.                              

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN AN INSURED TRUST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and   
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in an Insured Trust. An insurance  
policy obtained by an Insured Trust is non-cancelable and will continue in force
so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still 
in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held by the    
Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by the Trust
on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid 
by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any policy is   
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are   
outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The Portfolio  
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers, if any, are described in "Portfolio" 
in Prospectus Part I and the notes thereto. More detailed information regarding 
insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and Portfolio Insurers is        
included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional Information".           

The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust guarantees the timely
payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due. For this     
purpose, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of 
principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer defaults in the     
payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer enters into a bankruptcy        
proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is accelerated, the affected         
Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the outstanding principal amount of the 
bond plus accrued interest to the date of payment and thereby retire the bond   
from an Insured Trust prior to the bond's stated maturity date. The insurance   
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. The 
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the bond (i.e.,         
insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the holder) (the
"Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance     
premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the bond. It is expected  
that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if 
upon exercise the Trust would receive net proceeds in excess of the sale        
proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.                          

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of      
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At the date      
hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be 
submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the    
ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of  
insurance. The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished
by such companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio     
Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and
is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made   
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Sponsor. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of the Trusts. Van Kampen Funds
Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc. ("Van Kampen
Investments"). Van Kampen Investments is a diversified asset management company 
that administers more than three million retail investor accounts, has extensive
capabilities for managing institutional portfolios and has more than $99 billion
under management or supervision as of December 31, 2009. Van Kampen Investments 
is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated     
("Morgan Stanley"), a preeminent global financial services firm that provides a 
wide range of investment banking, securities, investment management and wealth  
management services. On October 19, 2009, Morgan Stanley announced that it had  
reached a definitive agreement to sell its retail asset management business to  
Invesco Ltd. The transaction ("Transaction") includes a sale of the unit        
investment trust business, including the Sponsor. The Transaction is subject to 
certain approvals and other conditions to closing, and is currently expected to 
close in mid-2010. The Sponsor's principal office is located at 522 Fifth       
Avenue, New York, New York 10036. As of December 31, 2009, the total            
stockholders' equity of Van Kampen Funds Inc. was $161,397,932 (unaudited).     

The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Van    
Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to      
report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid    
potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct   
with respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional      
information about the Sponsor. If we fail to or cannot perform our duties under 
the trust agreement or become bankrupt, the Trustee may appoint a new sponsor,  
continue to operate your Trust without a sponsor, or terminate your Trust and   
distribute the liquidation proceeds.                                            

Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company      
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its       
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, 
Brooklyn, New York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. If you have questions       
regarding your account or your Portfolio, please contact the Trustee at its     
principal unit investment trust division offices or your financial adviser. The 
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information. The Bank of New 
York Mellon is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of  
Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance           
Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional information regarding the
Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement, including the Trustee's     
qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a merger        
involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the       
Trustee. See "Additional Information".                                          

Portfolio Administration. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as 
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These     
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain 
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the    
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The          
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description of
circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

  If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of    
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, 
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to 
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the 
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for
inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also instruct the
Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust continues to       
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and to avoid       
imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.                         

Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its 
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been         
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of 
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must 
(i) be long-term or intermediate term (as applicable) corporate or taxable      
municipal bonds, debentures, notes or other straight debt obligations (whether  
secured or unsecured and whether senior or subordinated) without equity or other
conversion features, with fixed maturity dates substantially the same as those  
of the Failed Bonds having no warrants or subscription privileges attached; (ii)
be payable in United States currency; (iii) not be when, as and if issued       
obligations or restricted securities; (iv) be issued after July 18, 1984 if the 
interest is United States source income; (v) be issued or guaranteed by an      
issuer subject to or exempt from the reporting requirements under Section 13 or 
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or  
guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by means of a lease agreement, agreement to 
buy securities, services or products, or other similar commitment of the credit 
of such an issuer to the payment of the substitute bonds; (vi) maintain the S&P 
AAA rating, if any; and (vii) be eligible for (and when acquired be insured     
under) the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all 
Unitholders of a Trust within five days after the acquisition of a Replacement  
Bond and shall make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the 
cost of the Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued  
interest. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales   
charge attributable to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of the Trust and     
distribute the principal and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed 
Bonds to the date of removal from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds   
within 30 days after removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated   
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current  
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be  
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in   
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                        

   Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the Trust
Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision which may 
be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely     
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the      
Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the
number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in      
substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in a Trust, except for the
substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of 
any amendment.                                                                  

Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the Units then    
outstanding (or with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series   
119 and subsequent series, by consent of Unitholders of 75% of the Units then   
outstanding) or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of  
the original principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the       
Trustee in the event that a sufficient number of Units of the Trust not yet sold
are tendered for redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust  
would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time    
they were deposited in the Trust. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder of any
termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any remaining      
bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount than     
might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time. For this 
reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination may  
be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of     
purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share of the       
balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs,        
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Evaluator, Supervisor and Trustee 
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of
any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the   
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any 
action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not  
liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as     
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be        
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by
the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information
available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor, Supervisor or Unitholders for errors in      
judgment.                                                                       

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grantor Trusts                                                            

This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax     
consequences of owning Units of a Trust which has been structured to be taxed as
a grantor trust for federal tax purposes. Please see "Notes to Financial        
Statements" in Prospectus Part I. Tax laws and interpretations change           
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to  
all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not describe your      
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a       
tax-exempt entity, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition,   
this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.   

  This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions   
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the 
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. The    
Trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its     
compliance and reporting obligations.                                           

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

  Assets of the Trust. Each Trust is expected to hold various debt obligations
(the "Debt Obligations") that are treated as debt for federal income tax        
purposes. It is possible that the Trust will also hold other assets, including  
assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those  
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences    
different from or in addition to those described in this section. All of the    
assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets." Neither our counsel nor 
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.   

Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with the
documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income tax 
law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata       
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., interest, accruals of original issue 
discount and market discount, and capital gains, if any) from each Trust Asset  
when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned
the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have your distributions     
reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from Trust Assets that
you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by    
amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses.                            

   Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss Upon Disposition. If your Trust disposes of
Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of your 
Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain or  
loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your      
adjusted tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total     
amount received in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax
basis in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, including     
sales charges, among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the  
date you acquire your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to 
adjust your tax basis after you acquire your Units (for example, in the case of 
accruals of original issue discount, market discount, premium and accrued       
interest, as discussed below).                                                  

If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net   
capital gain is generally 15% (zero for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax
brackets). These capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years  
beginning before January 1, 2011. For later periods, if you are an individual,  
the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 20% (10%
for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The 20% rate is reduced 
to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term capital gains from most  
property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding period of more than    
five years.                                                                     

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital 
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as  
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
however, treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations. 

Dividends Received Deduction. Because the Debt Obligations are treated as 
debt (not equity) for federal income tax purposes, distributions from the Debt  
Obligations are not eligible for the dividends received deduction.              

Discount, Accrued Interest and Premium on Debt Obligations. Some Debt     
Obligations may have been issued with original issue discount. This generally   
means that the Debt Obligations were originally issued at a price below their   
face (or par) value. Original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and       
generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes. Your   
basis of each Debt Obligation that was issued with original issue discount must 
be increased as original issue discount accrues.                                

   Some of the Debt Obligations may give their issuers a right to defer payments
on the Debt Obligations. Such Debt Obligations are subject to special treatment 
under the original issue discount rules. Among other things, this treatment may 
result in you being required to recognize income for federal income tax purposes
in a particular year with respect to a Debt Obligation even though the actual   
cash payments on the Debt Obligation have been deferred to a later year.        

Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a   
market discount. Market discount is generally the excess of the stated          
redemption price at maturity for the Debt Obligation over the purchase price of 
the Debt Obligation. Market discount can arise based on the price your Trust    
pays for a Debt Obligation or based on the price you pay for your Units. Market 
discount is taxed as ordinary income. You will recognize this income when your  
Trust receives principal payments on the Debt Obligation, when the Debt         
Obligation is disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem your Units.   
Alternatively, you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it 
accrues. Whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate    
your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions.               

Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a   
premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any Debt       
Obligation, generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable at    
maturity, such excess is considered premium. You may elect to amortize premium. 
If you make this election, you may reduce your interest income received on the  
Debt Obligation by the amount of the premium that is amortized and your tax     
basis will be reduced.                                                          

If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a Debt Obligation,
you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that Debt Obligation.
When your Trust receives this accrued interest, you must treat it as a return of
capital and reduce your tax basis in the Debt Obligation.                       

This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax   
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,   
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For      
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the          
discussion set forth above in the case of Debt Obligations that were issued with
original issue discount.                                                        

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, the exchange would generally be considered a 
sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes. In general, any 
gain on the sale will be treated as capital gain and any loss will be treated as
capital loss. However, any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be          
disallowed to the extent that Units disposed of are replaced within a period of 
61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of    
Units or to the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or     
enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or   
securities. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to 
reflect the disallowed loss                                                     

In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this   
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units. For an in kind distribution, you will receive Trust Assets   
plus, possibly, cash. You will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive   
whole Trust Assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion
of the same Trust Assets held by your Trust. However, if you also receive cash  
in exchange for a Trust Asset or a fractional portion of a Trust Asset, you will
generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of  
cash you receive and your tax basis in such Trust Asset or fractional portion.  

Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You  
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust to the same   
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat some or
all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.         
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the    
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.                                 

Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other 
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or   
trust), you may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including          
withholding taxes, on some of the income from your Trust or gain from the sale  
or redemption of your Units, provided that certain conditions are met. You      
should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in 
order to be exempt for U.S. tax purposes. You should also consult your tax      
advisor with respect to other U.S. tax withholding and reporting requirements.  

Foreign Taxes. Some distributions by your Trust may be subject to foreign 
withholding taxes. Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you.  
Under the grantor trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your    
share of any foreign taxes that are paid. Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you 
may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.   

   New York Tax Status. Under the existing income tax laws of the State and City
of New York, your Trust will not be taxed as a corporation, subject to the New  
York State franchise tax and the New York City general corporation tax, and the 
income of your Trust will pass through to the Unitholders in the same manner as 
for federal income tax purposes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding  
potential federal, foreign, state or local taxation with respect to your Units  
based on your individual circumstances.                                         

Investors in the Trust may be subject to federal, state, local, or foreign
taxes in connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are encouraged
to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal, state, local, 
and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of an investment  
in the Trust.                                                                   

Regulated Investment Companies                                            

This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax     
consequences of owning Units of a Trust that has elected to be taxed as a       
regulated investment company for federal tax purposes. Please see "Notes to     
Financial Statements" in Prospectus Part I. This section is current as of the   
date of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and    
these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.   
For example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are
a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a tax-exempt entity, or other
investor with special circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe
your state, local or foreign tax consequences.                                  

  This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions   
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the 
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. The    
Trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its     
compliance and reporting obligations.                                           

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Trust Status. The Trust intends to elect and to qualify annually as a     
"regulated investment company" under the federal tax laws. If the Trust         
qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as       
required by the tax law, the Trust generally will not pay federal income taxes. 

 Distributions. After the end of each year, you will receive a tax statement
that specifies your amount of exempt-interest dividends, ordinary income        
distributions and capital gains dividends. Exempt-interest dividends generally  
are excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes. Some or all
of the exempt-interest dividends, however, may be taken into account in         
determining your alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences    
(e.g., they may affect the amount of your social security benefits that are     
taxed). Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax  
rate. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital
gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares. In addition, the Trust 
may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and  
thus will generally not be taxable to you. The tax status of your distributions 
from your Trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in   
additional shares or receive them in cash. The income from your Trust that you  
must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts
used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws may require you to    
treat distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on       
December 31 of the previous year.                                               

Dividends Received Deduction and Qualified Dividend Income. A corporation 
that owns Units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received        
deduction with respect to dividends received from the Trust because the         
dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from  
regulated investment companies. An individual who owns Units generally will not 
be entitled to treat Trust distributions as qualified dividend income currently 
taxed at long-term capital gains rates as it is not expected that Trust         
distributions will be attributable to qualified dividend income received by the 
Trust.                                                                          

Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will   
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain
or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the amount
you receive in the transaction. Your initial tax basis in your Units is         
generally equal to the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges. In
some cases, however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase   
your Units. Further, if you hold your Units for six months or less, any loss    
incurred by you related to the disposition of such a Unit will be disallowed to 
the extent of the exempt-interest dividends you received, if any.               

Capital Gains and Losses. If you are an individual, the maximum marginal  
federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 15% (zero for certain        
taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). These new capital gains rates are   
generally effective for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011. For     
later periods, if you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate  
for net capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 
15% tax brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to
8% for long-term capital gains from most property acquired after December 31,
2000 with a holding period of more than five years.                             

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a 
capital gain dividend from your Trust and sell your Unit at a loss after holding
it for six months or less, the loss will be disallowed to the extent of the     
exempt-interest dividends you received. To the extent, if any, it is not        
disallowed, it will be recharacterized as long-term capital loss to the extent  
of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates for capital gains realized 
from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary    
income. The Code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special     
situations.                                                                     

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, the exchange would generally be considered a 
sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes. In general, any 
gain on the sale will be treated as capital gain and any loss will be treated as
capital loss. However, any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be          
disallowed to the extent that Units disposed of are replaced within a period of 
61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of    
Units or to the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or     
enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or   
securities. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to 
reflect the disallowed loss.                                                    

In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this  
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units. This distribution will be treated as a sale for federal      
income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss, generally    
based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash        
received. The IRS could however assert that a loss could not be currently       
deducted.                                                                       

 Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, expenses incurred by your Trust
will be deducted from the gross income received by your Trust and only your     
share of the Trust's net income will be paid to you and reported as taxable     
income to you. However, if the Units of your Trust are held by fewer than 500   
Unitholders at any time during a taxable year, your Trust will generally not be 
able to deduct certain expenses from income, thus resulting in your reported    
share of your Trust's taxable income being increased by your share of those     
expenses, even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution. In  
this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses; however,      
certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses, may be  
deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  
2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.                                   

Investors in the Trust may be subject to federal, state, local, or foreign
taxes in connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are encouraged
to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal, state, local, 
and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of an investment  
in the Trust.                                                                   

EXPENSES                                                                        
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,     
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may       
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to     
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.     
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until   
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and           
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation, printing
and execution of the Trust Agreement and the certificates, legal and accounting 
expenses, advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial    
evaluation fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor 
at no cost to the Trusts.                                                       

 Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated     
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for     
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio   
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of  
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the     
total cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will   
receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential         
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's         
portfolio. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under    
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be 
reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its       
services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the      
Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses   
and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders.   
These fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on  
the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on       
January 1 for each year thereafter.                                             

   Insurance. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of an Insured
Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As bonds   
covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed by     
their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the premium  
will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the right to
obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent insurance   
will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related bonds.         

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be    
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any special        
custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds in a     
Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of  
the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for advancing funds  
to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may be adjusted      
periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest rates). Each    
Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement    
each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are       
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in  
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts     
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts.

Risk Factors

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor    
nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect   
in any of the bonds.                                                            

Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. Certain Trusts may   
invest significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell      
consumer products. The profitability of these companies will be affected by     
various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending
trends. In the past, there have been major changes in the retail environment due
to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in  
the retail industry, particularly the department store segment. The continued   
viability of the retail industry will depend on the industry's ability to adapt 
and to compete in changing economic and social conditions, to attract and retain
capable management, and to finance expansion. Weakness in the banking or real   
estate industry, a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in
employment growth, less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked            
deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in          
significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely 
affecting consumer spending habits. In addition, competitiveness of the retail  
industry will require large capital outlays for investment in the installation  
of automated checkout equipment to control inventory, to track the sale of      
individual items and to gauge the success of sales campaigns. Changes in        
demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and the success
of, consumer products and services in the marketplace. Increasing employee and  
retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry. In many  
sectors of the retail industry, competition may be fierce due to market         
saturation, converging consumer tastes and other factors. Because of these      
factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries,    
American retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such
as sudden weakening of foreign economies, difficulty in adapting to local       
conditions and constraints and added research costs.                            

Financial Services Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds   
issued by companies within the bank and financial services sector.              

The effects of the sub-prime mortgage crisis that began to unfold in 2007 
continue to manifest in nearly all the sub-divisions of the financial services  
industry. Sub-prime mortgage related losses and write downs among investment    
banks and similar institutions reached significant levels in 2008. The impact   
of these losses among traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and   
insurers has forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation 
or combination, while drastically increasing the credit risk, and possibility   
of default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles.     
Many of the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to   
finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity        
capital. In some cases, the U.S. government has acted to bail out or provide    
support to select institutions, however the risk of default by such issuers has 
nonetheless increased substantially.                                            

While the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve Board and      
Congress have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with 
financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated     
with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result 
of these steps.                                                                 

Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse   
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly     
dependent on net interest margin. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the
availability and cost of capital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when    
interest rates change or due to increased competition. As initial home          
purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest 
rates and other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in the real
estate markets have deteriorated and have had a substantial negative effect upon
banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans   
secured by real estate. Banks and their holding companies are subject to        
extensive federal regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to
state regulation as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements   
and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may  
pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in         
connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may             
substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if
deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the    
safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as       
increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases 
in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the   
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings  
and the ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of     
deposits nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or         
profitability of banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk  
of investment in the securities issued by such institutions.                    

  The statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks
and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone     
substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes are        
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act;    
enacted in August 1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. Many of the      
regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been          
finalized and their impact on the business, financial condition and prospects   
of the securities in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty.  
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act financial-services overhaul legislation allows       
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial      
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to           
investors. This legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and       
heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field.        
Legislation to liberalize interstate banking has been signed into law in recent 
years, allowing banks to be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in   
any state. Since mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into  
branches. Consolidation is likely to continue. The Securities and Exchange      
Commission (the "SEC") and the Financial Accounting Standards Board require the 
expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules         
requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts  
or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may result in          
increased volatility in the reported health of the industry, and mandated       
regulatory intervention to correct such problems. Additional legislative and    
regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory         
authorities have proposed substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act 
and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as  
to the effect, if any, that such changes would have on the bonds in the Trust's 
portfolio. In addition, from time to time the deposit insurance system is       
reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that       
system could, among other things, further restrict the ways in which deposited  
moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits   
insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce profitability, as          
investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and 
as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face     
significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds, 
credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance companies, and          
increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and    
national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such legislation      
allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited 
state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit.   
Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any prediction as to what, if     
any, manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what      
ultimate effect such actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.               

The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank   
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by 
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view     
that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay     
cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in     
ways that would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also 
may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its        
approval of certain applications, including applications for approval of        
mergers and acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any     
prediction as to the effect, if any, such laws will have on the bonds or        
whether such approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.                         

Companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and competition 
from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes in the direction 
of the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level  
and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could       
adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the prices of the          
securities, of these companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including  
increased competition with new and existing competitors, the ongoing            
commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital    
expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of     
companies in the investment management and brokerage industries. Companies      
involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive    
regulation by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and        
changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such laws,   
regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies.                    

Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management      
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business         
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management       
company profits, including but not limited to interest rate movements, the      
imposition of premium rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in     
given underwritings, competition and pressure to compete globally, weather      
catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual   
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the 
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject 
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate  
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or       
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy 
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit  
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of     
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology 
and the pressure to compete globally.                                           

In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the    
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors, 
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:           

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
       property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
         could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
  material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;                                                  

o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be   
          expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
         have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;                                

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
   property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;          

  o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
        appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
  light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
         insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;        

    o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;

    o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
   value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and              

     o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.         

The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come   
under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have           
considered or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state        
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company         
systems. Further, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")  
and state insurance regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations,  
specifically focusing on insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws  
and the development of new laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal      
agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the       
United States to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation. 
The Sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will  
be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance         
industry, or what effect, if any, such legislation would have on the industry.  

All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that    
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of  
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as         
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some    
instances, would require divestiture.                                           

Health Care Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
companies within the health care sector. Health care companies involved in      
advanced medical devices and instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care,      
hospital management/health services and medical supplies have potential risks   
unique to their sector of the health care field. These companies are subject to 
governmental regulation of their products and services, a factor which could    
have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and             
availability of such products or services. Furthermore, such companies face the 
risk of increasing competition from new products or services, generic drug      
sales, termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and 
the risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete. The   
research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial,    
and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the    
product will ever come to market. Many of these companies may have losses and   
not offer certain products for several years. Such companies may also have      
persistent losses during a new product's transition from development to         
production, and revenue patterns may be erratic. The goods and services of      
health care issuers are also subject to risks of product liability litigation.  

Health care facility operators may be affected by events and conditions   
including, among other things, demand for services, the ability of the facility 
to provide the services required, physicians' confidence in the facility,       
management capabilities, competition with other hospitals, efforts by insurers  
and governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing state        
rate-setting agencies, expenses, government regulation, the cost and possible   
unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of   
governmental financial assistance, including that associated with Medicare,     
Medicaid and other similar third-party payor programs.                          

Legislative proposals concerning health care are proposed in Congress from
time to time. These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and   
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription      
drugs), national health insurance, incentives for competition in the provision  
of health care services, tax incentives and penalties related to health care    
insurance premiums and promotion of pre-paid health care plans. The government  
could also reduce funding for health care related research. The Sponsor is      
unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if enacted, on the      
issuers of Securities in your Trust.                                            

Industrials Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
industrials companies. General risks of industrials companies include the       
general state of the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and  
international politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. In        
addition, capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall 
capital spending levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in     
modernization, limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations,         
government regulations, government contracts and ecommerce initiatives.         
Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their    
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, labor disputes or changes in government budget     
priorities, changes in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable    
business travel. The number of housing starts, levels of public and             
non-residential construction including weakening demand for new office and      
retail space, and overall construction spending may adversely affect            
construction equipment manufacturers.                                           

 Information Technology Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by issuers within the information technology industry. Your Trust, and   
therefore Unitholders, may be particularly susceptible to a negative impact     
resulting from adverse market conditions or other factors affecting technology  
issuers because any negative impact on the technology industry will not be      
diversified among issuers within other unrelated industries. Accordingly, an    
investment in Units should be made with an understanding of the characteristics 
of the information technology industry and the risks which such an investment   
may entail.                                                                     

  Information technology companies generally include companies involved in the
development, design, manufacture and sale of computers, computer related        
equipment, computer networks, communications systems, telecommunications        
products, electronic products, and other related products, systems and          
services. The market for information technology products and services,          
especially those specifically related to the Internet, is characterized by      
rapidly changing technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market        
patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions.   
The success of the issuers of the Securities depends in substantial part on the 
timely and successful introduction of new products. An unexpected change in one 
or more of the technologies affecting an issuer's products or in the market for 
products based on a particular technology could have a material adverse affect  
on an issuer's operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that   
the issuers of the Securities will be able to respond timely to compete in the  
rapidly developing marketplace.                                                 

  The market for certain information technology products and services may have
only recently begun to develop, is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an  
increasing number of market entrants. Additionally, certain information         
technology companies may have only recently commenced operations or offered     
securities to the public. Such companies are in the early stage of development  
and have a limited operating history on which to analyze future operating       
results. It is important to note that following its initial public offering a   
security is likely to experience substantial price volatility and speculative   
trading. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that upon redemption of Units   
or termination of a Trust a Unitholder will receive an amount greater than or   
equal to the Unitholder's initial investment.                                   

Based on trading history, factors such as announcements of new products or
development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have     
caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to  
fluctuate substantially. Market volatility may adversely affect the market price
of the Securities and therefore the ability of a Unitholder to redeem units, or 
roll over Units into a new trust, at a price equal to or greater than the       
original price paid for such Units.                                             

Some key components of certain products of information technology issuers 
are currently available only from single sources. There can be no assurance     
that in the future suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in  
a timely and cost effective manner. Accordingly, an issuer's operating results  
and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in 
price for, or and interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components.   
Additionally, many information technology issuers are characterized by a highly 
concentrated customer base consisting of a limited number of large customers    
who may require product vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly          
developing industry standards. Any failure to comply with such standards may    
result in a significant loss or reduction of sales. Because many products and   
technologies are incorporated into other related products, certain companies    
are often highly dependent on the performance of other computer, electronics    
and communications companies. There can be no assurance that these customers    
will place additional orders, or that an issuer of Securities will obtain       
orders of similar magnitude as past orders form other customers. Similarly, the 
success of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of     
products or technologies with intense competition between companies.            
Accordingly, a decline in demand of such products, technologies or from such    
customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the Securities.    

Telecommunications Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds   
issued by telecommunications companies. The telecommunications industry is      
subject to governmental regulation, and the products and services of            
telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence. These        
factors could affect the value of Units. Telephone companies in the United      
States, for example, are subject to both state and federal regulations          
affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be      
offered. Certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in   
fierce competition for a share of the market of their products. As a result,    
competitive pressures are intense and the values of telecommunications company  
securities are subject to rapid price volatility.                               

  Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have
illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies. 
High debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the   
1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt and stock prices to trade   
at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the   
cost of capital for needed additional investment. At the same time, demand for  
some telecommunications services has fallen sharply, as several key markets     
have become oversaturated, some local customers have switched to substitute     
providers and technologies, and corporate profits and the economy generally     
remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies may have to commit       
substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new products and        
services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have been          
compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing, consolidating  
and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines.     
Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also faced         
scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the         
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

  While a portfolio may concentrate on the securities of established suppliers
of traditional telecommunication products and services, a Trust may also invest 
in bonds of smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the     
development of new products and services. These smaller companies may present   
greater opportunities for capital appreciation, and may also involve greater    
risk than large, established issuers. Such smaller companies may have limited   
product lines, market or financial resources, and their securities may trade    
less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger, more       
established companies. As a result, the prices of the securities of such        
smaller companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of          
securities of other issuers.                                                    

In addition, recent federal legislation governing the United States       
telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional   
interpretation, which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are   
held by a Trust.                                                                

 Utility and Energy Issuers. Because certain Trusts may invest significantly
in bonds issued by public utility and energy companies, an investment in Units  
of certain Trusts should be made with an understanding of the characteristics   
of the public utility and energy industries and the risks which such an         
investment may entail. General problems of the public utility and energy        
industries include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on invested   
capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by the      
public service commissions having jurisdiction, the difficulty in financing     
large construction programs during an inflationary period, the restrictions on  
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental, nuclear 
safety and other regulatory considerations, the difficulty of the capital       
markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities, the difficulty in         
obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, regulatory         
restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the     
retail and business customer, and the effects of energy conservation. There is  
no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the   
future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating 
and other expenses and debt service requirements. All of the public utilities   
which are issuers of securities in certain Trusts have been experiencing many   
of these problems in varying degrees. Furthermore, utility and energy stocks    
are particularly susceptible to interest rate risk, generally exhibiting an     
inverse relationship to interest rates. As a result, electric utility stock     
prices may be adversely affected as interest rates rise. Similarly, the success 
of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or 
technologies with intense competition between companies. There can be no        
assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that an issuer  
of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other 
customers. Accordingly, a decline in demand of such products, technologies or   
from such customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of          
securities in certain Trusts.                                                   

Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility  
commissions which, for example, establish the rates which may be charged and    
the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base, which must be         
approved by the state commissions. Certain utilities have had difficulty from   
time to time in persuading regulators, who are subject to political pressures,  
to grant rate increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment. 
Any unexpected limitations could negatively affect the profitability of         
utilities whose budgets are planned far in advance. In addition, gas pipeline   
and distribution companies have had difficulties in adjusting to short and      
surplus energy supplies, enforcing or being required to comply with long-term   
contracts and avoiding litigation with their customers, on the one hand, or     
suppliers, on the other.                                                        

Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in
recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial 
companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been         
permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic       
regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities may permit 
certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates   
of return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend their core business 
and may be less profitable.                                                     

Certain of the issuers of securities in certain Trusts may own or operate 
nuclear generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time   
review existing, and impose additional, requirements governing the licensing,   
construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear generating projects 
in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases,   
construction delays and licensing difficulties. These have been caused by       
various factors, including inflation, high financing costs, required design     
changes and rework, allegedly faulty construction, objections by groups and     
governmental officials, limits on the ability to finance, reduced forecasts of  
energy requirements and economic conditions. This experience indicates that the 
risk of significant cost increases, delays and licensing difficulties remain    
present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear 
project. Also, nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned   
outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new     
regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining  
regulatory approval to return to service. A major accident at a nuclear plant   
anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation, 
construction or licensing of nuclear units.                                     

  In view of the uncertainties discussed above, there can be no assurance that
any utility company's share of the full cost of nuclear units under construction
ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a company could    
earn an adequate return on its investment in such units. The likelihood of a    
significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of concern described  
above varies, as does the potential severity of any adverse impact. It should be
recognized, however, that one or more of such adverse events could occur and    
individually or collectively could have a material adverse impact on a company's
financial condition, the results of its operations, its ability to make interest
and principal payments on its outstanding debt or to pay dividends.             

Other general problems of the electric, gas and water utility industries  
(including state and local joint action power agencies) include rising costs of 
rail transportation to transport fossil fuels, the uncertainty of transmission  
service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions, changes in tax   
laws which adversely affect a utility's ability to operate profitably,          
increased competition in service costs, recent reductions in estimates of       
future demand for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country,          
restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to        
environmental considerations, uncertain availability and increased cost of      
capital, unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices,   
including the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with           
conversion to alternate fuel sources such as coal, availability and cost of     
natural gas for resale, technical and cost factors and other problems           
associated with construction, licensing, regulation and operation of nuclear    
facilities for electric generation, including, among other considerations, the  
problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of   
radioactive wastes, and the effects of energy and environmental conservation    
efforts. Each of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of 
the issuers of any utility and energy bonds to make dividend payments and the   
value of such issues on redemption of your Units.                               

Taxable Municipal Issues. Certain bonds in a Trust may consist of taxable 
obligations of municipal issuers. Obligations of municipal issuers can be       
either general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing 
power of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific     
project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy        
taxes.                                                                          

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the    
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or  
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

 Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

 Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease     
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from     
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments   
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for       
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the     
need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and 
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).    

 Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number   
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,      
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or       
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these       
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on  
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,  
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or 
other regulatory restrictions.                                                  

Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or        
housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally 
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses,         
mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of      
subsidies.                                                                      

Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from  
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or 
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates    
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate     
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

 Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

 Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

 Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends   
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from  
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,     
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation 
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of  
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                 

Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from 
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues  
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to    
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand    
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government           
regulation and rate approvals.                                                  

Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon"   
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer     
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep  
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount      
bond, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at       
higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to   
substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market      
interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.    

Insurance on the Bonds

  Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
certain Trusts, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior to the  
deposit of such bonds in a Trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and    
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in such Insured Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the prospectus. Each insurance policy  
obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is non-cancelable and will continue in    
force so long as such Insured Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio   
Insurer is still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to 
be held by such Insured Trust (see "Portfolio" for the Trust in the Prospectus  
Part I). Non-payment of premiums on a policy obtained by an Insured Trust will  
not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take  
action against the Trustee to recover premium payments due it. The Trustee in   
turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such Insured Trust. Premium 
rates for each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an Insured    
Trust are fixed for the life of an Insured Trust. The premium for any insurance 
policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer, 
and any such policy or policies are non-cancelable and will continue in force so
long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the Portfolio Insurer remains  
in business. If the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable 
to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the      
claims-paying ability of any such insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio Insurers  
have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above
described events.                                                               

The aforementioned Trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of       
principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due. For the purposes of the   
Portfolio Insurance, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for    
the payment of principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a 
bond defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such    
issuer enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is  
accelerated, the Portfolio Insurer involved has the option, in its sole         
discretion, for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest 
to occur of such a default, bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the    
outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of  
such payment and thereby retire the bond from an Insured Trust prior to such    
bond's stated maturity date. The insurance does not guarantee the market value  
of the bonds or the value of the Units. Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust  
is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such Insured Trust. In the   
event of a sale of any such bond by the Trustee, such insurance terminates as   
to such bond on the date of sale.                                               

Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the      
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy     
obtained by an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with  
respect to such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of    
the identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the        
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related    
thereto from the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an 
Insured Trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that   
the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon 
such exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond         
proceeds less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the    
Permanent Insurance) from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such      
bonds were sold on an uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to    
each bond eligible for Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the   
insurability of each bond as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased  
or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of each bond.               

The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an      
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by an Insured Trust     
insurance policy may be sold out of the Insured Trust with the benefits of the  
insurance attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the   
time of sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is 
not the case in connection with any value attributable to such Insured Trust's  
portfolio insurance). See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the Prospectus   
Part II. Because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of
the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option, 
the Sponsor anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be       
comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of
default, it is much less likely that the Insured Trust would need at some point 
in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of Units than if the Insured Trust  
were to have no such option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in
the Prospectus Part II) and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust, 
if the Insured Trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk  
of default, the Insured Trust would not need to hold such bonds until their     
respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the Insured Trust's   
portfolio insurance. (See "Trust Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement"
in the Prospectus Part II.) Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an 
Insured Trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the
present intention of the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance      
(including the right to obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing
the price or redemption value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance   
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of    
such default. The value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between
(i) the market value of a bond which is in default in payment of principal or   
interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the    
right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premium and related     
expenses attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the      
market value of such bond not covered by Permanent Insurance. See "Public
Offering--Offering Price" in the Prospectus Part II for a more complete         
description of an Insured Trust's method of valuing defaulted bonds which have a
significant risk of default.                                                    

  ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). ACA Financial
Guaranty is an insurance subsidiary of ACA Capital Holding, Inc. that is        
organized in the State of Maryland. ACA Financial Guaranty assumes credit risk  
through the issuance of financial guaranty insurance policies across all of its 
business lines. While ACA is subject to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services      
("S&P") guidelines and capital adequacy tests which must be met in order to     
maintain a rating, as well as internal risk management parameters, its insured  
risk portfolio contains exposures of various credit qualities.                  

On August 8, 2008, ACA Financial Guaranty and counterparties to its       
structured finance products reached an agreement on a restructuring plan for    
ACA Financial Guaranty. The plan, approved by the Maryland Insurance            
Administration, provided for settlement of the structured finance obligations   
and protection for ACA Financial Guaranty's municipal policyholders. The        
settlement required that ACA Financial Guaranty make a $209 million cash        
payment and a distribution of surplus notes. The surplus notes provide the      
former CDO counterparties and certain other counterparties with what amounts to 
a 95% economic interest in ACA Financial Guaranty. ACA Financial Guaranty       
continues to operate as a runoff insurance company and focus on actively        
monitoring its remaining insured municipal obligations. ACA Financial           
Guaranty's statutory capital of $174.7 million at September 30, 2008, was down  
from $414.8 million as of December 31, 2007, reflecting in part the cost of the 
settlement.                                                                     

On December 15, 2008, S&P raised the financial strength, financial        
enhancement, and issuer credit ratings on ACA Financial Guaranty to B from CCC, 
with a developing outlook. The upgrade reflects the positive effects of the     
restructuring transaction completed in August 2008 that settled all outstanding 
CDO and reinsurance exposures of the company, including the significantly       
deteriorated CDO of ABS transactions, eliminating a requirement to post a       
significant amount of collateral to the CDO of ABS counterparties. At the same  
time, S&P also withdrew the ratings at ACA Financial Guaranty's request.

 The information relating to ACA Financial Guaranty contained above has been

existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Ambac Financial Group,   
Inc., headquartered in New York City, is a holding company incorporated on      
April 29, 1991. Ambac's activities are divided into two business segments: (i)  
Financial Guarantee and (ii) Financial Services. Ambac provides financial       
guarantee insurance for public and structured finance obligations through its   
principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance Corporation. Ambac Assurance is 
the successor to the founding financial guarantee insurance company, which      
wrote the first bond insurance policy in 1971. As a holding company, Ambac is   
largely dependent on dividends from Ambac Assurance to pay dividends on its     
common stock, to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and to pay its  
operating expenses.                                                             

On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial     
strength rating to AA from AAA, with negative implications. On June 19, 2008,   
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") downgraded Ambac Assurance's        
insurance financial strength rating from Aaa to Aa3, with a negative outlook.   
Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of Ambac Assurance's insurance financial        
strength rating reflects Ambac Assurance's overall credit profile in the current
environment, including its significantly constrained new business prospects, its
impaired financial flexibility and increased expected and stress loss           
projections among its mortgage-related risk exposures relative to previous      
estimates. Moody's noted, however, that these risks are mitigated somewhat by   
Ambac Assurance's substantive capital cushion at the current rating level and   
that this was an important consideration in arriving at the Aa3 insurance       
financial strength rating. On November 5, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength rating of Ambac from Aa3 to Baa1, with a developing outlook, 
as a result of greater than expected mortgage-related losses in the third       
quarter. On November 19, 2008, S&P lowered its insurance financial strength     
rating of Ambac to A from AA, with a negative outlook. The November 19, 2008    
rating action on Ambac reflects S&P's view that Ambac's exposures in the U.S.   
residential mortgage sector and particularly the related collateralized debt    
obligation structures have been a source of significant and comparatively       
greater-than-competitor losses and will continue to expose the company to the   
potential for further adverse loss development. On April 13, 2009, Moody's      
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac from Baa1 to Ba3,   
with a developing outlook, reflecting Ambac's weakened business position and    
very constrained financial flexibility, as well as its weakened risk adjusted   
capitalization, as Moody's loss estimates on RMBS securities have increased     
significantly. In Moody's view, these higher loss estimates increase the        
estimated capital required to support Ambac's sizable direct RMBS portfolio     
(including securities owned as well as securities guaranteed) and also the      
insurer's large portfolio of ABS CDO risks. On June 24, 2009, S&P lowered the   
counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of   
Ambac to BBB from A with negative implications. The June 24, 2009 rating action 
on Ambac reflects S&P's view that Ambac is effectively in runoff and the        
likelihood of the company continuing as an operating entity capable of writing  
new business has decreased significantly. On July 28, 2009, S&P lowered the     
counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of   
Ambac to CC from BBB, with a developing outlook. The July 28, 2009 rating action
on Ambac reflects S&P's view of the significant deterioration in the Ambac's    
insured portfolio of nonprime residential mortgage-backed securities and related
CDOs, which has required the company to strengthen reserves to account for      
higher projected claims. In S&P's view, the additional reserves will have a     
significant negative effect on operating results, which will likely cause       
surplus to decline to below regulator-required minimums. On July 29, 2009,      
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac from Ba3 to 
Caa2, with a developing outlook, reflecting Moody's belief that, as a result of 
Ambac's recently announced large loss reserve increase and credit impairment    
charge estimated for the second quarter of 2009 which would reduce Ambac's      
regulatory capital to levels below the required minimum threshold, there will be
increased pressure on Ambac's counterparties to commute outstanding exposures on
terms that could imply a distressed exchange.                                   

There have been a number of recent developments with respect to ratings   
actions by the rating agencies. In light of the ongoing nature of ratings       
actions or announcements by the rating agencies, one should consult             
announcements by the rating agencies, the websites of the rating agencies and   
Ambac's website for the then current publicly available information. These      
ratings actions have had a significant impact on Ambac Assurance's ability to   
compete in the financial guarantee business. As a result of these rating agency 
actions, as well as investor concern with respect to these actions, Ambac       
Assurance and its operating subsidiaries have been able to originate only a de  
minimis amount of new financial guarantee business since November 2007.         

Ambac Assurance is subject to insurance regulatory requirements of the    
States of Wisconsin and New York, and the other jurisdictions in which it is    
licensed to conduct business. Statutory capital and surplus was $1,554,448 and  
$3,316,443 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Qualified statutory     
capital was $3,484,057 and $6,422,605 at December 31, 2008 and 2007,            
respectively. Statutory net income (loss) for Ambac Assurance was ($4,034,666), 
$53,964 and $788,989 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Statutory capital   
and surplus differs from stockholders' equity determined under GAAP principally 
due to statutory accounting rules that treat loss reserves, consolidation of    
subsidiaries, premiums earned, policy acquisition costs and deferred income     
taxes differently.                                                              

The parent company of Ambac Assurance, Ambac Financial Group, Inc. ("Ambac
Company"), is subject to the informational requirements of the Securities       
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and in accordance        
therewith files reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date

Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty") and Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. ("Assured Municipal") (formerly Financial Security Assurance, Inc.        
("FSA")). Assured Guaranty, a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. ("Assured"),  
is organized in the State of Maryland and provides financial guaranty insurance 
to both the municipal and structured finance sectors. Assured Municipal, also a 
subsidiary of Assured, is a separately capitalized company organized in the     
State of New York and provides municipal bond insurance.                        

On July 1, 2009, Assured completed the purchase of Financial Security     
Assurance Holdings Ltd. ("FSAH"), the parent of financial guaranty insurance    
company, FSA, from Dexia Holdings Inc. (the "FSAH Acquisition"). Effective      
November 9, 2009, FSA was renamed Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. In certain   
states, Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. may operate under its prior name,      
Financial Security Assurance Inc.                                               

On July 1, 2009, S&P published a Research Update in which it affirmed its 
"AAA" counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on Assured Guaranty    
and Assured Municipal. At the same time, S&P revised its outlook on Assured     
Guaranty to negative from stable and continued its negative outlook on Assured  
Municipal. S&P cited as a rationale for its actions the large single risk       
concentration exposure that Assured and Assured Municipal retain to Belgium and 
France related to the residual exposure to FSAH's financial products segment    
prior to the posting of collateral by Dexia S.A., a Belgian corporation, in     
October 2011, all in connection with the FSAH Acquisition.                      

On November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength 
rating of Assured Guaranty from Aaa to Aa2, primarily reflecting Moody's updated
view on Assured Guaranty's exposure to weakness inherent in the financial       
guaranty business model. Also on November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the      
insurance financial strength rating of FSA from Aaa to Aa3, reflecting Moody's  
view of FSA's diminished business and financial profile resulting from its      
exposure to losses on U.S. mortgage risks and disruption in the financial       
guaranty business more broadly. On November 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded the    
insurance financial strength rating of Assured Guaranty from Aa2 to Aa3, with a 
negative outlook. Moody's November 12, 2009 downgrade results from Moody's      
review of the performance of Assured's mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS")      
exposures. Moody's said that adverse trends in RMBS loss estimates have had     
varying effects on Assured's main insurance subsidiaries.                       

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, Assured reported 2008 net    
income of $68.9 million, an increase of $372.2 million over the net loss of     
$303.3 million that Assured reported for 2007. The improvement in 2008 was      
principally due to the change in unrealized gains and losses on credit          
derivatives. Assured had after-tax unrealized gains on credit derivatives of    
$57.1 million ($0.64 per diluted share) in 2008 as compared to after-tax        
unrealized losses on credit derivatives of $480.0 million ($7.06 per diluted    
share) in 2007. Operating income was $74.5 million in 2008, a decrease of 58%   
from $178.0 million in 2007. Operating income in 2008 benefited from a $102.1   
million increase in net earned premiums and a $34.5 million increase in net     
investment income compared to 2007 as a result of the growth of Assured's       
financial guaranty business in 2008. However, the increase in net earned        
premiums and net investment income was more than offset by a $260.0 million     
increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses ($201.7 million after-tax) and a  
$40.1 million increase in incurred losses on credit derivatives ($30.9 million  
after tax) compared to 2007. In both periods, the majority of the loss and loss 
adjustment expenses and incurred losses on credit derivatives were largely      
associated, either directly or indirectly, with the credit deterioration of     
U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities.                                    

  In January 2009, Assured Guaranty finalized an agreement with CIFG Assurance
North America, Inc. to assume a diversified portfolio of financial guaranty     
contracts totaling approximately $13.3 billion of net par outstanding. Assured  
Guaranty received $75.6 million, which included $85.7 million of upfront        
premiums net of ceding commissions and approximately $12.2 million of future    
installments related to this transaction.

  Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp ("BHAC"). BHAC is a bond insurance company
created by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. ("Berkshire") in December 2007, to insure   
municipal and state bonds initially in New York, and later in states including  
California, Puerto Rico, Texas, Illinois, and Florida. On February 12, 2008, CEO
Warren Buffett announced a plan to add up to $5 billion in capital to BHAC to   
enable it to provide reinsurance on municipal bonds currently guaranteed by     
Ambac, MBIA, and FGIC.                                                          

Berkshire is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of 
diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance          
businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis. Berkshire 
also owns and operates a large number of other businesses engaged in a variety  
of activities, as identified herein. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of     
Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is located in Omaha, Nebraska.         

Berkshire's insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally
high levels. This strength differentiates Berkshire's insurance companies from  
their competitors. Collectively, the aggregate statutory surplus of Berkshire's 
U.S. based insurers was approximately $51 billion at December 31, 2008 and $62  
billion at December 31, 2007. The decline in statutory surplus in 2008 was      
primarily due to declines in market values of equity securities. On April 11,
2008, S&P assigned an initial rating of AAA to BHAC's insurance financial       
strength, with a stable outlook. On April 25, 2008, Moody's assigned an initial 
rating of Aaa to BHAC's insurance financial strength, with a stable outlook. On 
April 8, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of    
BHAC from Aaa to Aa1, with a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects Moody's    
view concerning "the impact on Berkshire's key businesses of the severe decline 
in equity markets over the past year as well as the protracted economic         
recession." Moody's noted that Berkshire is also exposed to heightened          
volatility in its earnings and capital base related to market value fluctuations
within its large portfolio of equity derivatives. On February 4, 2010, S&P      
lowered the financial strength rating of BHAC from AAA to AA+, with a stable    
outlook. The February 4, 2010 rating action was taken in anticipation of        
Berkshire's acquisition of Northern Santa Fe Corporation reflecting S&P's       
expectation that a significant part of the internal cash for the acquisition    
will come from Berkshire's core insurance operations and that Berkshire's       
overall capital adequacy has weakened to levels no longer consistent with a AAA 
rating and is not expected to return to extremely strong levels in the near     
term.                                                                           

   As of December 31, 2008, Berkshire had total assets of $267 billion and total
liabilities of $154 billion.                                                    

  The information relating to BHAC and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by BHAC or the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as   
to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any  
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.              

CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). CIFG, through its operating  
companies CIFG Assurance North America, Inc., a New York corporation, and CIFG  
Europe, provides financial guarantees for transactions in the public finance,   
structured finance, and infrastructure finance markets in the United States,    
Europe and around the world.                                                    

   On March 6, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Aaa to A1, with a stable outlook. This rating action reflects      
Moody's assessment of CIFG's weakened capitalization, impaired business         
opportunities, and uncertain strategic direction, as a result, in part, of its  
exposures to the US residential mortgage market. Moody's believed that CIFG's   
significant exposure to the mortgage sector, especially ABS CDOs is indicative  
of a risk posture far greater than would be consistent with a Aaa rating going  
forward. The company's participation in several mezzanine ABS CDOs, in          
particular, contributed to this view. The rating agency noted that CIFG is      
implementing significant changes to its governance and risk management to       
address some of the shortcomings of its prior strategy. Moody's added that CIFG,
as the smallest and most recent entrant to the financial guaranty sector, has   
not yet established a market position on par with its larger competitors and    
that the ongoing credit stress at the firm significantly weakened its franchise,
raising questions about the degree to which it will be able to regain market    
traction within a reasonable timeframe. CIFG's profitability is likely to remain
weak over the near to intermediate term, particularly given the losses that are 
likely to be generated by its insurance portfolio, the expected reduced issuance
volume, and the limited in-force book of business, said Moody's. On May 20,
2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of CIFG to Ba2
from A1, with direction uncertain, reflecting the high likelihood that, absent  
material developments, the company will fail minimum regulatory capital         
requirements in New York and Bermuda due to expected significant increases in   
modeled loss reserves on ABS CDOs. In Moody's view, the breach of such          
regulatory capital requirements would put the company in a precarious position, 
especially in light of the solvency provisions embedded in its CDS exposures. On
October 28, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of 
CIFG from Ba2 to B3, with direction uncertain, reflecting Moody's expectation of
substantially higher mortgage-related losses arising from CIFG's insured        
portfolio, as well as the possibility that certain troubled exposures could be  
commuted. On January 22, 2009, Moody's upgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of CIFG from B3 to Ba3, with a developing outlook, reflecting the        
strengthened capital adequacy profile of CIFG following its restructuring and   
the commutation of substantially all of its ABS CDO risks. Also on January 22,
2009, S&P raised the insurance financial strength rating of CIFG to BB from B,  
with a developing outlook. S&P's January 22, 2009 upgrade results from the      
completion of CIFG's restructuring plan involving key policyholders, creditors, 
and equity owners (counterparties) who had hedged their ABS CDO and commercial  
real estate CDO exposures with CIFG and which were significantly affected by    
defaults and downgrades of the underlying collateral. On June 15, 2009, S&P     
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement  
ratings of CIFG to CC from BB, with a negative outlook, reflecting S&P's view of
the significant deterioration in the company's insured portfolio of nonprime    
residential mortgage-backed securities, which has necessitated that CIFG        
strengthen reserves to account for the higher projected claims. On August 20,
2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of CIFG from  
Ba3to Caa2, resulting from significant deterioration in the company's remaining 
insured portfolio since January, 2009 when CIFG initiated a broad restructuring.
On November 11, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength       
ratings of CIFG from Caa2 to Ca. Also on November 11, 2009, Moody's announced   
that it will withdraw the insurance financial strength rating of CIFG. The      
November 11, 2009 rating actions reflect Moody's view that material             
deterioration in CIFG's insured portfolio adversely affected the guarantor's    
capital adequacy profile and Moody's believes that CIFG may no longer have      
sufficient financial resources to pay all insurance claims.                     

As of December 31, 2008, CIFG had net admitted assets of $306 million and 
total liabilities of $306 million. As of March 31, 2009, total surplus as       
regards policyholders increased from a negative ($2.6) billion in 2008 to $87.9 
million in 2009. The increase in surplus was due to the commutation and capital 
contribution described above, offset by continued deterioration that resulted   
in higher loss reserves on the remaining insured portfolio. Additionally,       
surplus was also reduced due to the reinsurance agreement with Assured Guaranty 
which closed in January 2009. Under the reinsurance agreement, Assured Guaranty 
agreed to assume a diversified portfolio of financial guaranty contracts        
totaling approximately $13.3 billion of net par outstanding. CIFG's surplus     
position as of March 31, 2009 caused the company to fail aggregate, and         
single-risk statutory capital requirements.

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). FGIC is a wholly owned     
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation. The company provides financial guaranty         
insurance and other forms of credit enhancement for public finance and          
structured finance obligations. FGIC typically guarantees the scheduled         
payments of principal and interest on an issuer's obligations when due. FGIC is 
licensed to write financial guaranty insurance in all 50 states, the District   
of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and,     
through a branch, the United Kingdom.                                           

The deterioration in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and the global 
credit markets, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2007 and continued   
throughout 2008, has adversely affected the company's business, results of      
operations and financial condition. Specifically, the company incurred          
significant losses related to its exposure to certain collateralized debt       
obligations of asset-backed securities, which are backed primarily by subprime  
residential mortgage-backed securities, and to certain residential              
mortgage-backed securities, primarily backed by second-lien mortgages. As a     
result of these losses, FGIC's statutory capital and surplus position was       
substantially reduced below historical levels. In addition, the company's       
financial strength and credit ratings were downgraded by various rating agencies
during 2008. The company has ceased writing new business and does not currently 
have any plans to recommence writing new financial guarantee business in the    
foreseeable future and there can be no assurance that the company will ever be  
able to recommence writing new business.                                        

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2007, FGIC's financial strength was rated  
"Aaa" by Moody's "AAA" by S&P, and "AAA" by Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch").      
Moody's, S&P and Fitch have since completed several assessments of FGIC's       
capital adequacy in relation to the company's exposure to ABS CDOs which are    
backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and its exposure to first-lien and           
second-lien RMBS. As a result of these assessments, Moody's, S&P and Fitch      
downgraded the financial strength ratings of FGIC. As of March 31, 2008, Fitch  
had downgraded FGIC from AA to BBB with Rating Watch Negative; Moody's had      
downgraded FGIC from A3 to Baa3 and S&P had downgraded FGIC from A to BB. On    
June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of    
FGIC from Baa3 to B1, reflecting FGIC's severely impaired financial flexibility 
and proximity to minimum regulatory capital requirements relative to Moody's    
estimates of expected case losses. The financial strength ratings downgrades    
have adversely impacted the company's ability to generate new business and,     
unless restored, will impact the company's future business, operations and      
financial results. On November 24, 2008, S&P lowered its insurance financial    
strength rating of FGIC to CCC from BB, with a negative outlook. S&P's November
24, 2008 downgrade results from FGIC's exposure to nonprime and second-lien     
mortgages and related collateralized debt obligations of asset-backed           
securities. On December 19, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial    
strength rating of FGIC from B1 to Caa1, with a negative outlook, reflecting    
Moody's expectation of higher mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's       
insured portfolio and the constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of    
the holding company. On March 24, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance        
financial strength rating of FGIC from Caa1 to Caa3, with a negative outlook,   
reflecting Moody's expectation of higher mortgage-related losses arising from   
FGIC's insured portfolio, insufficient claims paying resources to cover Moody's 
estimate of expected loss, and the constrained liquidity and financial          
flexibility of FGIC's holding company. Also on March 24, 2009, Moody's withdrew 
the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC. On April 22, 2009, S&P lowered 
the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings  
of FGIC to CC from CCC, with a negative outlook. Also on April 22, 2009, S&P    
withdrew the ratings on FGIC and the counterparty credit rating on the holding  
company, FGIC Corporation because of S&P's expectation that timely and          
comprehensive financial information will no longer be available.                

As of December 31, 2008, FGIC had net admitted assets of approximately    
$4,947 million and total liabilities of approximately $4,955 million.           
Statutory-basis surplus of FGIC at December 31, 2008 was $505.5 million.        

On November 24, 2009, FGIC announced that pursuant to an order of the New 
York Insurance Department, the company must suspend any and all claims payments 
until it has removed the impairment of its capital and restored to compliance   
its minimum surplus to policyholders requirement.

National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National Guarantee")      
(formerly MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois")). MBIA, Inc., a    
Connecticut corporation, conducts its financial guarantee business through      
though its wholly-owned subsidiaries MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA Corp.")  
and MBIA Illinois. MBIA Corp. is the successor to the business of the Municipal 
Bond Insurance Association, which began writing financial guarantees for        
municipal bonds in 1974. MBIA Corp. is the parent of MBIA Capital Markets       
Assurance Corporation ("CapMAC"), a financial guarantee insurance company that  
was acquired by MBIA Corp.                                                      

On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded MBIA Corp.'s insurance financial strength 
rating to AA from AAA. On June 19, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance       
financial strength ratings of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from Aaa  
to A2. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its insurance          
affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s limited financial flexibility and impaired     
franchise, as well as the substantial risk within its portfolio of insured      
exposures and a movement toward more aggressive capital management within the   
group. On November 7, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength 
rating of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from A2 to Baa1, with a       
developing outlook. Moody's November 7, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its    
insurance affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s diminished business and financial    
profile resulting from its exposure to losses from US mortgage risks and        
disruption in the financial guaranty business more broadly. On February 18,
2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp.  
from Baa1 to B3, with a developing outlook, reflecting MBIA Corp.'s substantial 
reduction in claims-paying resources relative to the remaining higher-risk      
exposures in its insured portfolio, given the removal of capital, and the       
transfer of unearned premium reserves associated with the ceding of its         
municipal portfolio to MBIA Illinois, as well as the continued deterioration of 
MBIA Corp.'s insured portfolio of largely structured credits, with stress       
reaching sectors beyond residential mortgage-related securities. Also on        
February 18, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and 
financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB+ from AA, with a negative    
outlook. The February 18, 2009 rating action on MBIA Corp. reflects S&P's view  
that MBIA Corp.'s retained insured portfolio lacks sufficient sector diversity  
and with time could become more concentrated, and that MBIA Corp.'s 2005--2007  
vintage direct RMBS, CDO of ABS, and other structured exposures are subject to  
continued adverse loss development that could erode capital adequacy. At the    
same time, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of
MBIA Illinois to AA- from AA, reflecting MBIA Illinois's uncertain business     
prospects and capital. On June 5, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,    
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB from 
BBB+, with a negative outlook, resulting from MBIA Corp.'s increased loss       
assumptions on its 2005--2007 vintage direct RMBS and CDO of ABS and a change in
the assumed tax benefit of tax-loss carryforwards. Also on June 5, 2009, S&P    
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement  
ratings of National Guarantee to A from AA-, with a negative outlook, reflecting
S&P's view of National Guarantee's uncertain business and capital-raising       
prospects. On September 28, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BB+ from BBB, with 
a negative outlook, reflecting S&P's view that macroeconomic conditions continue
to contribute to losses on the group's structured finance products.             

Virtually all of the insurance policies issued by MBIA Corp. provide an   
unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of the payment to a designated paying   
agent for the holders of the insured obligations of an amount equal to the      
payment of the principal of, and interest or other amounts owing on, insured    
obligations when due or, in the event that MBIA Corp. has the right, at its     
discretion, to accelerate insured obligations upon default or otherwise, upon   
such acceleration by MBIA Corp. In addition, certain of MBIA Corp.'s insurance  
policies guarantee payments due under credit or other derivatives, including    
termination payments that may become due upon the occurrence of certain events. 
On February 25, 2008, MBIA Corp. announced that it ceased insuring new credit   
derivative contracts within its insurance operations except in transactions     
related to the reduction of existing derivative exposure. In the event of a     
default in payment of principal, interest or other insured amounts by an        
issuer, MBIA Corp. promises to make funds available in the insured amount       
generally on the next business day following notification. MBIA Corp. generally 
has an agreement with a bank which provides for this payment upon receipt of    
proof of ownership of the obligations due, as well as upon receipt of           
instruments appointing the insurer as agent for the holders and evidencing the  
assignment of the rights of the holders with respect to the payments made by    
the insurer.                                                                    

Because MBIA Corp. generally guarantees to the holder of the underlying   
obligation the timely payment of amounts due on such obligation in accordance   
with its original payment schedule, in the case of a default on an insured      
obligation, payments under the insurance policy cannot be accelerated against   
MBIA Corp., except in certain limited circumstances, unless MBIA Corp. consents 
to the acceleration. In the event of a default, however, MBIA Corp. may have the
right, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the obligations and pay them in    
full. Otherwise, MBIA Corp. is required to pay principal, interest or other     
amounts only as originally scheduled payments come due. Typically, even if the  
holders are permitted by the terms of the insured obligations to have the full  
amount of principal, accrued interest or other amounts due, declared due and    
payable immediately in the event of a default, MBIA Corp. is required to pay    
only the amounts scheduled to be paid, but not in fact paid, on each originally 
scheduled payment date. MBIA Corp.'s payment obligations after a default vary by
deal and by insurance type. There are three primary types of policy payment     
requirements: i) timely interest and ultimate principal; ii) ultimate principal 
only at final maturity; and iii) payments upon settlement of individual         
collateral losses as they occur upon erosion of deal deductibles.               

  At December 31, 2008, the net par amount outstanding on MBIA Corp.'s insured
U.S. public finance obligations (including obligations assumed from FGIC) was   
$554 billion. At December 31, 2008, net insurance in force, which includes all  
insured debt service, was $908 billion. At December 31, 2008, the net par       
amount outstanding on MBIA Corp.'s insured obligations, including insured       
obligations of MBIA UK, MBIA Mexico, and CapMAC but excluding obligations that  
were ceded or assigned to MBIA Illinois as of January 1, 2009 and also          
excluding $8.4 billion of MBIA insured investment agreements and medium-term    
notes for MBIA Asset Management, LLC ("MBIA Asset Management") was $233         
billion. Net insurance in force for the above portfolio, which includes all     
insured debt service, at December 31, 2008 was $290 billion.                    

As of December 31, 2008, MBIA, Inc. had admitted assets of $30 billion    
(unaudited), total liabilities of $29 billion (unaudited), and total capital    
and surplus of $3.5 billion (unaudited), determined in accordance with          
statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory  
authorities. MBIA, Inc. recorded a net loss of $2.7 billion, or $12.29 per      
share, for the full year 2008, compared with a net loss of $1.9 billion, or     
$15.17 per share, for the full year 2007.                                       

 On February 18, 2009, MBIA, Inc., the parent company of MBIA, announced the
restructuring of its financial guaranty insurance operations following the      
approval of the New York and Illinois insurance regulators. The restructuring   
involves the segregation of its financial guaranty insurance operations into    
two separately capitalized sister companies, with MBIA Illinois assuming the    
risk associated with its US municipal exposures, and with MBIA insuring the     
remainder of the portfolio, including all international and structured finance  
exposures. Business recently ceded to MBIA from FGIC has been assigned to MBIA  
Illinois. To provide additional protection for its municipal bond               
policyholders, MBIA Illinois has also issued second-to-pay policies for the     
benefit of the policyholders covered by the reinsurance and assignment. The     
second-to-pay policies, which are a direct obligation of MBIA Illinois, will be 
held by The Bank of New York Mellon as insurance trustee. These policies        
provide that if MBIA or FGIC, as applicable, do not pay valid claims of their   
policyholders, the policyholders will then be able to make a claim directly     
against MBIA Illinois under the second-to-pay policies. MBIA Illinois intends   
to apply for approval to redomesticate from Illinois to New York. On March 19,
2009, MBIA Illinois formally changed its name to National Public Finance        
Guarantee Corporation. National Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA, 
Inc. and independently capitalized with $5.5 billion in claims-paying resources 
as of June 30, 2009. In certain states, National Public Finance Guarantee       
Corporation may operate under its prior name, MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois.

 Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian"). Radian Group Inc. ("Radian Group")
is a global credit risk management company headquartered in Philadelphia with   
significant operations in New York and London. Financial guaranty insurance     
typically provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty to the holder of a 
financial obligation of full and timely payment of principal and interest when  
due.                                                                            

   On March 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating
of Radian, as well as the ratings of its operational affiliates, from A3 to Ba1,
with a stable outlook, reflecting the substantial deterioration in the credit   
profile of Radian Guaranty, the group's main mortgage insurance operating       
company and parent of Radian, coupled with increased loss estimates on Radian's 
pooled corporate exposures. On November 24, 2009, S&P lowered the financial     
strength, financial enhancement, and corporate credit ratings of Radian to BB   
from BBB- and left the ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications,       
reflecting S&P's view that adverse loss development in Radian's insured         
portfolio has resulted in higher capital charges and could result in further    
losses.                                                                         

As of December 31, 2008, Radian had total assets of $8.1 billion, total   
liabilities of $6.1 billion, and had statutory policyholders' surplus of $968   
million and a contingency reserve of $515 million.                              

The information relating to Radian and its affiliates contained above has 
been furnished by Radian or the rating agencies. No representation is made      
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the         
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date     
hereof.                                                                         

 Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee") (formerly XL Capital Assurance
Inc. ("XLCA")). On March 17, 2006, XL Capital Ltd formed Syncora Holdings Ltd   
("Syncora Holdings"), (formerly known as Security Capital Assurance Ltd), as a  
wholly-owned Bermuda based subsidiary holding company. On July 1, 2006, XL      
Capital Ltd contributed all its ownership interests in its financial guarantee  
insurance and financial guarantee reinsurance operating businesses to Syncora   
Holdings. The aforementioned operating businesses included Syncora Guarantee.   

In February 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength     
ratings of XLCA to A3 from Aaa. On June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the        
insurance financial strength rating of XLCA from A3 to B2, reflecting XLCA's    
severely impaired financial flexibility and proximity to minimum regulatory     
capital requirements relative to Moody's estimates of expected case losses. On  
October 24, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of 
Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee", formerly XLCA). On November 18,
2008, S&P lowered its insurance financial strength rating of Syncora Guarantee  
to B from BBB- with developing expectations. S&P's November 18, 2008 downgrade  
resulted from the Syncora Guarantee's delay in implementing its restructuring   
plan and slow progress in its negotiations with counterparties of its           
collateralized debt obligation of asset-backed securities exposure. On January
29, 2009, S&P lowered the issuer credit and financial strength ratings of       
Syncora Guarantee to CC from B, with a negative outlook. S&P's January 29, 2009 
downgrade resulted from S&P's recent update to its distressed exchange          
criteria. On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength 
rating of Syncora Guarantee from Caa1 to Ca, with a developing outlook, as a    
result of the large loss reserve and credit impairment charges taken by Syncora 
Guarantee on its mortgage-related exposures during the fourth quarter, which    
have resulted in a $2.4 billion statutory deficit at Syncora Guarantee as of    
December 31, 2008. Moody's said that Syncora Guarantee's capital position is    
now below minimum statutory capital regulations under New York law, which       
heightens the risk of regulatory action. On April 27, 2009, S&P revised the     
financial strength and financial enhancement ratings of Syncora Guarantee to R  
from CC (an issuer rated "R" by S&P is under regulatory supervision because of  
its financial condition). Also on April 27, 2009, S&P revised the counterparty  
credit rating of Syncora Guarantee to D from CC (an issuer rated "D" by S&P has 
failed to pay one or more of its financial obligation when it became due).      
S&P's April 27, 2009 rating actions resulted from Syncora Guarantee's           
announcement that pursuant to an order of the New York Insurance Department,    
the company must suspend any and all claims payments until it has restored its  
policyholders' surplus to a level greater than or equal to $65 million, the     
minimum the state requires.                                                     

As a result of the material increase in adverse development relating to   
anticipated claims on its guarantees of ABS CDOs and reserves for unpaid losses 
and loss adjustment expenses on its guarantees of RMBS recorded during 2008,    
Syncora Guarantee reported a statutory policyholders' deficit of $2.4 billion   
as of December 31, 2008. Operating expenses were $230.8 million for the year    
ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $131.9 million or 133.4%, as compared   
to $98.9 million for 2007.

The information relating to Syncora Guarantee and its affiliates contained
above has been furnished by Syncora Guarantee or the rating agencies. No        
representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such            
information, or as to the existence of any adverse changes in such information  
subsequent to the date hereof.                                                  

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by        
jurisdiction, but New York and most other jurisdictions have laws and           
regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of      
dividends, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions  
or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings.                

In order to be in an Insured Trust, bonds must be insured by one of the   
Preinsured Bond Insurers or be eligible for the insurance being obtained by     
such Trust, if any. In determining eligibility for insurance, the Preinsured    
Bond Insurers and the Portfolio Insurers have applied their own standards which 
correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the     
insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the 
criteria used in the selection of bonds by the Sponsor. To the extent the       
standards of the Preinsured Bond Insurers and the Portfolio Insurers are more   
restrictive than those of the Sponsor, the previously stated Trust investment   
criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds. This decision is made     
prior to the Date of Deposit, as debt obligations not eligible for insurance    
are not deposited in an Insured Trust. Thus, all of the bonds in the portfolios 
of the Insured Trusts are insured either by the respective Trust or by the      
issuer of the bonds, by a prior owner of such bonds or by the Sponsor prior to  
the deposit of such bonds in a Trust.                                           

An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is to    
obtain a higher yield on the portfolio of such Trust than would be available if 
all the bonds in such portfolio had S&P "AAA" rating and yet at the same time   
to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest and           
principal, when due, on the bonds. There is, of course, no certainty that this  
result will be achieved. Preinsured Bonds in an Insured Trust (all of which are 
rated "AAA" by S&P) may or may not have a higher yield than uninsured bonds     
rated "AAA" by S&P. In selecting such bonds for an Insured Trust, the Sponsor   
has applied the criteria hereinbefore described.                                

  In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in respect of
a bond, a Portfolio Insurer shall make such payment after the respective        
insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened    
(but not earlier than the date such payment is due). The insurer, as regards    
any payment it may make, will succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect   
thereof. All policies issued by the Portfolio Insurers, if any, and the         
Preinsured Bond Insurers are substantially identical insofar as obligations to  
an Insured Trust are concerned.                                                 

The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter ruling which holds in    
effect that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted      
municipal obligations paid to holders of insured bonds, under policy provisions 
substantially identical to the policies described herein, will be excludable    
from federal gross income under Section 103(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code  
to the same extent as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal 
obligations. Holders of Units in an Insured Trust should discuss with their tax 
advisers the degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling.     
However, counsel for the Sponsor at the time of the closing of the Insured      
Trust, had given an opinion to the effect such payment of proceeds would be     
excludable from federal gross income to the extent described under "Federal Tax
Status" in Prospectus Part II.                                                  

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of      
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder at some
time in the future. At the date hereof, it is reported that no claims have been 
submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which
would materially impair the ability of any such company to meet its commitment  
pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio insurance.                        

The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished by  
such companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio        
Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities    
and is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is    
made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the     
absence of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates 
thereof.                                                                        

Portfolio Administration

The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units      
tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may 
not be available, such of the bonds designated by the Evaluator as the Trustee  
in its sole discretion may deem necessary. The Evaluator, in designating such   
bonds, will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b)    
market value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are 
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption        
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve 
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, the overall quality  
of the bonds remaining in the Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. The      
Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose of    
bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.                                    

 The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution    
for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the       
Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take   
any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the 
issuer is in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of 
the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the   
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution 
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust    
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within   
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for      
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each        
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted          
therefor. Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement
Bonds" in Prospectus Part II regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds    
for Failed Bonds, the acquisition by the Trust of any bonds other than the      
bonds initially deposited is not permitted.                                     

If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs 
and no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio  
insurance, or otherwise, within 30 days, the Trustee is required to notify the  
Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee to sell or to     
hold such bonds within 30 days after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor 
of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted bond and  
not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.                    

Sponsor Information 

  Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of the Trusts. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc. ("Van Kampen

(This paragraph relates only to the Sponsor and not to the Trust or to any other
Series thereof. The information is included herein only for the purpose of      
informing investors as to the financial responsibility of the Sponsor and its   
ability to carry out its contractual obligations. More detailed financial       
information will be made available by the Sponsor upon request.)                

The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Van    
Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to      
report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid    
potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct   
with respect to your Trust.                                                     

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Trustee Information 

 The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit        
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to 
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New  
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits 
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent          
permitted by law.                                                               

The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not 
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.  
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of  
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such       
records shall include the name and address of, and the certificates issued by   
the Trusts to, every Unitholder of the Trusts. Such books and records shall be  
open to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual   
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from 
time to time be required under any applicable state or Federal statute, rule or 
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the bonds held in the Trusts.                   

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has      
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee 
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes    
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or    
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any        
corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be          
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to  
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee   
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or  
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided   
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

Termination of the Trust Agreement

  A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
51% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding (or, with respect to Van Kampen  
Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 119 and subsequent series, by consent of     
Unitholders representing 75% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding) or by  
the Trustee when the value of the Trust, as shown by any semi-annual            
evaluation, is less than 20% of the original principal amount of bonds.         

A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient  
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,   
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to   
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If the Trust is     
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the   
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by  
such purchaser.                                                                 

The Trust Agreement provides that the Trust shall terminate upon the      
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but   
in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth 
anniversary of the Trust Agreement (twentieth anniversary for intermediate term 
trusts). In the event of termination of the Trust, written notice thereof will  
be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder of the Trust at his address appearing 
on the registration books of the Trust maintained by the Trustee, such notice   
specifying the time or times at which the Unitholder may surrender his          
certificate or certificates for cancellation. Within a reasonable time          
thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any bonds then held in the Trust and     
shall deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs, expenses or         
indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation   
of the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve   
to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges.   
The sale of bonds in the Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount    
than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time.   
For this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon         
termination may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds        
represented by the Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then        
distribute to each Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and      
Principal Accounts. With such distribution the Unitholders shall be furnished a 
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the   
Trustee in its sole discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve 
are no longer necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in   
the same manner.                                                                

Description of Ratings

Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &  
Poor's long-term debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the      
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This 
opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of 
guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.    

The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to  
purchase, sell or hold the debt obligation, inasmuch as they do not comment as  
to market price or suitability for a particular investor.                       

The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based on current         
information furnished by the obligor or obtained by Standard & Poor's from      
other sources it considers reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an      
audit in connection with any credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on        
unaudited financial information. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended or    
withdrawn as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or 
based on other circumstances.                                                   

 The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based, in varying degrees,
on the following considerations:                                                

     I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
          its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.                                          

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

  III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
          the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangement under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

The credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As  
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are   
typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in  
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has    
both senior and subordinate obligations, secured and unsecured obligations or   
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of 
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.   

  AAA--An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the          
obligation is extremely strong.                                                 

  AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
obligation is very strong.                                                      

A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in         
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial  
commitment on the obligation is still strong.                                   

BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.   
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely  
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment  
on the obligation.                                                              

Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having   
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

  Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major     
rating categories. r--This symbol is attached to the ratings of instruments     
with significant non-credit risks. It highlights risks to principal or          
volatility of expected returns which are not addressed in the credit rating.    

NR--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is       
insufficient information on which to base a rating or that Standard & Poor's    
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.                    

Moody's Investors Service. Municipal long-term rating scale. Moody's      
municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of issuers and issues  
in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate  
Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these        
issuers and issues. The default and loss content for Moody's municipal          
long-term rating scale differs from Moody's general long-term rating scale.     

Municipal ratings are based upon the analysis of five primary factors     
relating to municipal finance: market position, financial position, debt        
levels, governance, and covenants. Each of the factors is evaluated             
individually and for its effect on the other factors in the context of the      
municipality's ability to repay its debt.                                       

 Aaa--Issuers or issues rated Aaa demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                 

Aa--Issuers or issues rated Aa demonstrate very strong creditworthiness   
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                 

  A--Issuers or issues rated A present above-average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                          

  Baa--Issuers or issues rated Baa represent average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                          

Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," Ca" and "C" are regarded as having    
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating    
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or       
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the  
lower end of that generic rating category.                                      

General long-term rating scale. Moody's long-term obligation ratings are  
opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income obligations with an        
original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a      
financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Such ratings reflect both 
the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of       
default.                                                                        

Aaa--Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with  
minimal credit risk.                                                            

  Aa--Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to
very low credit risk.                                                           

 A--Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to
low credit risk.                                                                

Baa--Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are  
considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative             
characteristics.                                                                

Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," Ca" and "C" are regarded as having    
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating    
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or       
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the  
lower end of that generic rating category.

Weighted Avg P/B

Weighted Avg Market Cap (MM) 
$92,265.90




Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.

This could result in a reduction in the value of your Units. The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.

A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter.

The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities.

Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.








The Amazon.com eTextbooks Store




Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Well, you can save up to 80% off the print list price when you rent and up to 60% off the print list price when you buy eTextbooks. Renting eTextbooks couldn’t be easier.
