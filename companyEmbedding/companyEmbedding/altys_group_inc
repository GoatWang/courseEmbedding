About Us
Company Profile







Our business is enabling the lead-acid battery for advanced energy storage applications.
As a manufacturer of lead oxides and chemicals for industry, Hammond Group Inc. traces its beginnings to 1930 in Hammond, IN. where they operate to this day. For more than 80 years, Hammond has served industry’s evolving demand for lead oxides with products that include red lead, litharge, lead silicates, carbonates, and sulfates. To meet global demand, Hammond Group has built manufacturing locations in Pottstown, PA, Gateshead, England, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Today, Hammond serves niche lead applications while specializing in lead oxides for industrial and automotive batteries, including the new AGM technology. As Hammond’s commitment to lead-acid battery manufacturers grew, they developed expertise in the formulation and production of negative plate expanders essential to battery life. Hammond produces expanders in the U.S., UK, and Malaysia, offering a wide range of formulations tailored to a battery’s specific operating environment.
Hammond’s newest advanced expander line is designed to extend battery life in demanding, High Rate Partial State of Charge (HRPSoC) operations including Idle Stop-Start and Micro-Hybrid automotive applications.
Hammond has just begun an important expansion of their Hammond, IN battery laboratory first established in 2000 to complement a new, high-capacity expander production plant.

VIDEO: What makes a company a strong IPO candidate

Posted on September 16, 2016 | 1 comment



.
As you’ll hear from our experts, the decision to go public, whether traditional IPO or mini-IPO, is a mosaic of many factors:
Business

Does the business provide a unique service or product that doesn’t have direct competitors?
If the business has publicly traded competitors, what makes it unique?
Cost structure (e.g. more efficient manufacturing, differentiated geographic footprint)?

Size / Scale

Does the company currently have size and scale?
If no, is there an opportunity and plan to reach a sufficient size to be meaningful for institutional investors?

Rational

Use of proceeds
Additional capital required to grow
Employee recruitment and retention

Company Readiness

Adequacy of internal financial reporting and accounting controls (Sarbanes-Oxley)
Short-term and long-term business outlook
Financial performance trends and metrics for valuation
Predictability of operations and confidence in projections

Management Readiness

Quality and depth of management team
Public company experience
Performance expectations

Successful IPOs can make founders, owners and senior executives millionaires overnight, at least on a spread sheet. Equally, millions of equity financing can also be raised overnight—dollars that will be essential for fueling growth initiatives: new products, expanded markets, employee hires, research and development and acquisitions

REPORT: 90% of investors say infographics drive understanding

Posted on September 15, 2016 | Leave a comment


Certainly, it’s not breaking news that people like visuals – but that over 60% of institutional investors (and individual!) report that visuals affect their actual buying decisions is very actionable information for shareholder communicators.

Emphasize with visuals
Audio earnings calls are the cranky-old-men of investor relations. Stubborn to change, yet a valuable part of the family.
However, shareholder communications is now (and forever) a visual, web-based media and not utilizing this storytelling strength is a mistake. Embedding a few key PowerPoint slides into your quarterly reporting – both the webcast and the news release – will improve your storytelling as well as the discoverability of your news.
One point: keep GAAP and non-GAAP at equal visual prominence.

LEARN MORE INCLUDING VERBATIM “OTHER” COMMENTS: Our new “Shareholder Confidence 365 Study booklet is now available. You can order a printed copy here.

About the study:
Initially launched in 2012, the Shareholder Confidence 365 Study is an ongoing survey targeted at two key constituents with whom public companies communicate: institutional investors and individual investors. It was the first study of its kind — directly asking investors how they consume investor relations content. In 2014, we published an updated study.
For this 2016 iteration, we have segmented and compared the results between institutional investors and individual investors. To date. we have accumulated over 6,870 responses from a pool of 16,000 buy-side analysts & portfolio managers and from over 15,000 long-term holding retail investors. There are 29 questions.

Posted on September 9, 2016 | Leave a comment


Understanding Wall Street and Main Street investors drive conversations at annual event in Boston MA, Sept 18 – 21

NEW YORK, Sept 9, 2016 / PR Newswire / — PR Newswire & Vintage, the capital markets and corporate services division of PR Newswire, today announced that the company will be presenting their Investor Relations and Regulatory Compliance solutions at the National Investor Relations Institute (NIRI) 2016 IR Fundamentals Conference, Boston MA, Sept 18 – 21.

Of special discussion this year will be the distribution of Shareholder Confidence 365 Study: How Wall Street and Main Street Compare When Researching Stocks.
Order your free copy of this 30-page report. (click image)
Initially launched in 2012, the Shareholder Confidence 365 Study is an ongoing survey targeted at two key constituents with whom public companies communicate: institutional investors and individual investors. It was the first study of its kind — directly asking investors how they consume investor relations content. In 2014, we published an updated study.
The report may be ordered here: http://e.prnewswire.com/Shareholder-confidence-365-study.html
For this 2016 iteration, the report segments and compares the results between institutional investors and individual investors. To date, 6,870 responses have been accumulated from a pool of 16,000 buy-side analysts & portfolio managers and from over 15,000 long-term holding retail investors. There are 29 questions.
Questions include:

How often do you visit IR websites?
Why do visit IR websites?
Do you use Twitter for stock research?
Would a CEO video instill trust?
Do you use earnings estimates?

Currently, Vintage – PR Newswire has over 1000 PR and IR websites. Please visit Vintage today for more information: www.thevintagegroup.com

“Thanks for your speedy work last night. Hopefully, you can turn around this one quickly also!”

Posted on September 8, 2016 | Leave a comment


Fast turns and spot-on execution has redefined Vintage, helping us to be a top three solution in North America. Our work is highlighted every Monday in our “IPOs and Transactions of the Week” blog and email.  Importantly, our week’s success is further highlighted (and celebrated) by the appreciative notes our operations people receive each day from our clients.

We can’t not share the good news (anonymized for privacy). Sales can offer you full named references. 
Here is just a handful of the week’s notes: 
.

Kudos to our Mutual Funds team

Thanks SO much for all your help [with our prospectus]! I couldn’t have done it without you! You guys are the best!
.


.Kudos to our EDGAR team
I wanted to thank you all for your assistance yesterday getting our Form 10-Q filed yesterday.  It is very nerve wracking coming down to wire like we have the past two quarters.
I just wanted to say thank you for making sure that our changes went in and our 10-Q filed. Thanks again and hope you all have a relaxing day!
.


.Kudos to our XBRL team
I just had a very pleasant conversation with [client’s peer].
While I could not address his questions about preparing 8k’s and Form 4, I did tell him the system was very user friendly and the support from the staff is unbeatable.
 


.Kudos to our Print team
You guys were great. Thank you for the push to finish today.
.


.Kudos to our EDGAR team
Thank you very much [Vintage]! Once again, you guys have been awesome to deal with!!! Best Regards, [client].
.


.Kudos to our XBRL team
THANK YOU!!!  YOU ARE GREAT TO WORK WITH!!
.

Our rebrand was not just a logo change – it was a systemic and cultural reform throughout our operations. Our president, Liam Power, challenged his team to deliver the industry’s intelligent value, measured as fast turns and spot-on execution of services. You can meet Liam Power on this video. 
Thanks to our experts for delivering intelligent value!
