Common Questions
Beneficiary information 



What is a beneficiary?
The beneficiary is the person(s) designated in the policy to receive the death proceeds in the event of the Insured's death.


Can I designate my minor child as a beneficiary?
Yes. If proceeds become payable to a child during his/her minority, we will pay the court-appointed guardian for the estate of the child. The minor's parent automatically serves as guardian of the minor's person but not his/her estate.
Alternative suggestion: The policy owner should consider designating a Custodian to receive, manage, invest and distribute the proceeds for the minor under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. Ex: John Doe as custodian for Bobby Smith, a minor born 3/3/98, under the NY UTMA. When the minor reaches the age of majority, the custodianship terminates and the balance of any funds are distributed to the child.


Can I designate my revocable trust as beneficiary?
Yes, simply indicate the name of the trustee(s), the name of the trust, the date of the trust and the name(s) of the grantors in Section 1 of the Title Change Form. Sample wording: XYZ Bank as trustee or the successor trustee under an agreement known as the John Smith Living Trust dated 01/01/98, made by and between John Smith and said trustee. Click here for a printable form.


When is my change of beneficiary effective?
Any change of beneficiary will take effect as of the date the form was signed, provided is has been accepted and recorded at the Operations Center, subject to any payment made by us or action taken by us before receipt of the request at our Operations Center.


Can I designate multiple persons as primary beneficiary?
Yes. Simply indicate the relationship(s) to the insured person(s) along with the full names of the proposed beneficiaries. All primary beneficiaries should be listed in Section 1 under First Beneficiary(ies). Joint beneficiaries will receive equal shares proportionate to the number of those beneficiaries who survive the insured.


What should I do to change my beneficiary now that I am recently married?
A Title Change form (10481) should be completed, dated and signed. Indicate the new beneficiaries in Section 1 (be sure to indicate the full name and relationship of each person to the insured). Your change of name can also be indicated on the form in the space directly under the policy number. Click here for a printable form.


Must I complete a new change of beneficiary request form to reflect a change in the beneficiary's name due to marriage or divorce?
No. Simply write to us at
MONY Life of AmericaP. O. Box 4830Syracuse, NY 13221
advising us that your beneficiary, Jane Doe, has changed her name to Jane Smith. Provide her new address, if appropriate. We will make note of this information. No forms are necessary. Please be sure to include your policy number(s).


Can I use one form to change the beneficiary on all of my MONY policies/contracts?
Multiple policies may be indicated on each Title Change form (10481). However, separate forms must be used for each insured,except in the case of a Multi-Life policy. Click here for a printable form.


What is a Rights holder?
The person who can exercise rights is the rights holder of the policy. This term is synonymous with Owner, the individual who can exercise all rights under the provisions of the policy.


How does a Divorce impact my Beneficiary Designation?
If you are required to designate an ex-spouse or children as beneficiary(ies) pursuant to a divorce decree or order, then the decree should be submitted to us. We will conform the beneficiary designation to the terms of the decree. If you currently have your ex-spouse listed as beneficiary, then you should either change the beneficiary to reflect your new choice of beneficiary or to reconfirm your desire to designate the ex-spouse despite the divorce. In most states, a divorce does not automatically extinguish the rights of an ex-spouse as beneficiary. Therefore, an Insured who inadvertently leaves his/her ex-spouse as beneficiary of record may cause payment of the death benefits to the ex-spouse even though such payment is contrary to his/her intent.



Lost policy



How do I replace a policy that has been lost?
Once you have determined that the policy is lost and not temporarily misplaced, please advise us by completing a Certification of Loss or Destruction of Policy/Contract form(3551)and mailing it to the address shown.
Click here for a printable form.(If someone is holding the policy and refusing to surrender it due to an adverse death claim, the policy is not considered lost and you should advise us of the circumstances of the claim.)



Dividends



What are policy dividends?
Policy dividends are a return of divisible surplus to the owners of participating policies. Dividends are based on factors which change from year to year including investment earnings, mortality experience and expenses. Dividends are not guaranteed.


What are the available dividend options?
MONY has a wide variety of dividend options to choose from. For example, dividends can be: used to purchase paid-up additional insurance coverage

sent in cash
used to reduce the premium
left with the company to earn interest (which would be reported to the IRS via a 1099INT).

Other dividend options may be available from time to time.


Can dividends be withdrawn?
Yes. The available cash value of any dividend additions and/or deposits may be: withdrawn in cash

used to pay premiums on the same policy 
used to repay outstanding loan balances 

Such withdrawals will affect the total death benefit payable but will not affect the base policy face amounts.



Payments



What are the billing options available on my policy?
We offer a number of payment modes that may be available to pay premiums. Annual billing is the least expensive due to our lower billing costs and immediate interest earnings on the annual premium received.

Annual - Will require payment of the full year's payment on the policy anniversary date
Semi-Annual - Will require payments at six-month intervals, with one premium due on the policy anniversary date
Quarterly - Will require a payment at three-month intervals, with one premium due on the policy anniversary date
Monthly - Automatic payments under our MONY-Matic plan. Click here for a printable form.



Do I have an option to have premiums automatically withdrawn from my checking account?
Yes! We offer a convenient MONY-Matic payment method, which allows monthly premiums to be automatically withdrawn from your checking account. You can do this by completing our MONY-Matic Authorization form. Click here for a printable form.

Policy values



What is total death benefit?
The amount payable to a beneficiary upon the death of the insured. This generally represents the face amount of the base policy, the face amount of any additional coverage on the insured provided under a rider, the face amount of any dividend additions, the cash value of any dividend deposits, less any outstanding indebtedness (loan balance and loan interest).


What is total policy cash value?
This represents the guaranteed cash value of the base policy, if any, the cash value of any riders, the cash value of any accumulated dividends, less any outstanding indebtedness (loan balance and loan interest) that would be paid upon termination of the contract.


How can I access the funds in my policy and keep my valuable insurance protection?
There are several options that may be available to you

Withdraw any dividend for cash 
Withdraw any dividend cash value to help pay premiums 
Withdraw available dividend cash value to reduce any outstanding loan balance and/or pay loan interest 
Take a loan against the policy's cash value 
Take a policy loan to help pay premiums

Note: Please keep in mind when borrowing against the cash value, that loan interest will accrue daily and will be due on the policy anniversary date. Any outstanding indebtedness will be deducted from and will reduce the proceeds payable at surrender, lapse, or payment of a claim. Furthermore, withdrawals of dividend cash value will reduce the proceeds payable at surrender, lapse or payment of claim.


How can I obtain investment information on my Variable Life Policy?

Completing an online form called Transfer Request Click here for a printable form.

If the Owner of the policy is a corporation or a trust, and not an individual, we require the owner's written request for transfer. Complete and return to the address on the form.



Loans 



How does a policy loan affect my coverage?
Any outstanding indebtedness will be deducted from the proceeds payable at lapse, surrender, maturity, or payment of the death claim. Therefore, it is in the client's best interest to make loan repayments whenever possible. Loan repayments will also reduce future loan interest payments.


How can loan repayments be made?
Loan repayments can be made at your convenience in amounts of $10.00 or more by sending a check indicating the policy number and how the money is to be applied, to MONY Life of America, PO Box 4830, Syracuse, NY 13221. Additional loan repayment options are available such as

What is loan interest?
Like most financial institutions, we charge loan interest on the policy anniversary date to compensate for our loss of investment earnings from the borrowed amount. Please refer to your contract for details concerning your policy's loan interest rate.


How is loan interest charged?
Loan interest accrues daily on the unpaid loan balance and is due once a year on the policy anniversary date or upon full repayment of the loan principal. In most circumstances, if the loan interest remains unpaid at the end of the 31-day grace period, it will automatically be added to the existing loan balance, becoming interest-bearing loan principal.


How can I access the funds in my policy and keep my valuable insurance protection?
There are several options that may be available to you

Withdraw any dividend for cash 
Withdraw any dividend cash value to help pay premiums 
Withdraw available dividend cash value to reduce any outstanding loan balance and/or pay loan interest 
Take a loan against the policy's cash value 
Take a policy loan to help pay premiums 

Note: Please keep in mind when borrowing against the cash value, that loan interest will accrue daily and will be due on the policy anniversary date. Any outstanding indebtedness will be deducted from and will reduce the proceeds payable at surrender, lapse, or payment of a claim.

How can I confirm my policy's current cash value?

Net Cash Surrender Value reflects deductions from your policy's cash value for any loan and loan interest and any surrender charges, if they apply.

By calling our toll-free number at (800) 487-6669 and speaking to a Customer Service Representative



Do I have to repay the loan?
You can repay all or part of your loan at any time. Please note that unpaid policy loan balance and interest will reduce your policy's death benefit and cash value.
Interest will be billed annually, on your policy's anniversary. If you do not pay the amount due, it will be added to the amount of the loan and next year's interest will be based on this new loan amount. If the cash surrender value is ever insufficient to pay the loan balance, including unpaid loan interest, the policy could lapse.


What is the effect of a loan on a policy that is a MEC (Modified Endowment Contract)?
If your policy is a MEC (Modified Endowment Contract) the tax treatment of any death benefit provided under the contract will still qualify for income tax free treatment. However, you may be subject to additional taxes and penalties on any distributions from your policy during the lifetime of the insured. Any distribution from a policy that is a MEC will be taxed on an "income-first" basis. Distributions for this purpose include a loan (including any increase in the loan amount to pay interest on an existing loan or an assignment or a pledge to secure a loan) or withdrawal. Any such distributions will be considered taxable income to you to the extent there is gain in the policy at the time of distribution. That is, the distribution will be includible in income up to the amount your account value exceeds your basis in the policy.
A 10% penalty tax also will apply to the taxable portion of most pre-age 59 1/2 distributions from a policy that is a Modified Endowment Contract.

�GIO Transfer Period�). See �Transferring your money among our investment options � Transfers you can make� (or other applicable sections regarding transfers) in your Prospectus. We are relaxing our policy rules so that,
beginning on the business day after the Allocation Date and thereafter, you may transfer any amount of unloaned policy account value out of the guaranteed interest option to any other investment option whether or not you are within the GIO Transfer
Period until further notice.  � You can request a transfer via the Internet
by visiting our axa.com, or us.axa.com website for those outside of the U.S. and registering for online account access. If you need assistance, please contact a customer service representative by calling 1-800-777-6510. You can also write to us at our Administrative Office. In general, transfers take effect on the date the request is received. However, any written,
telephone, Internet or facsimile transaction requests received after 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) take effect the next business day.  �
Please note that this offer does not apply to any amounts that we are holding as collateral for a policy loan or as �restricted� amounts as a result of
your election to receive a living benefit, if available under your policy. In addition, if you elect to transfer account value to the Market Stabilizer Option (�MSO�), if available under your policy, there must be sufficient funds
remaining in the GIO to cover the applicable MSO charges. Finally, depending on your policy, there may be a charge for making this transfer. Your Prospectus will specify if your policy imposes a charge for this transfer.

  Prospectus Supplement Dated August 7, 2015 
   
  This Supplement modifies certain information in the above-referenced prospectus,
supplements to prospectus and statement of additional information (together the Prospectus) offered by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (AXA Equitable) and MONY Life insurance Company of America (MONY
America). You should read this Supplement in conjunction with your Prospectus and retain it for future reference. Unless otherwise indicated, all other information included in your Prospectus remains unchanged. The terms we use in this
Supplement have the same meaning as in your Prospectus. We will send you another copy of any prospectus or supplement without charge upon request. Please contact the customer service center referenced in your Prospectus. 
  The purpose of this Supplement is to provide you with information regarding certain
changes to the Prospectus. As applicable to your policy, please note the following changes:    In More information about procedures that apply to your policy, under Policy Issuance, under Register date, the first and second bullets are deleted in their entirety and
replaced with the following:   


 

 
 If you submit the full minimum initial premium to your financial professional at the time you sign the application and before the policy is issued, and we issue
the policy as it was applied for, then the register date will be the later of (a) the date you signed part I of the policy application or (b) the date a medical professional signed part II of the policy application. 
 


 

 
 If we do not receive your full minimum initial premium at our Administrative Office before the issue date or, if we issue the policy on a different basis than
you applied for, the register date initially will appear on your policy as the date the policy is issued; however, we will move the register date to the date we deliver the policy provided we received your full minimum initial premium. This will
ensure that premiums and charges will commence on the same date as your insurance coverage. If your policy was delivered on the 29th, 30th or 31st of the month, we will move the register date to the 1st of the following month. We will determine the
interest rate applicable to the guaranteed interest option based on the Register Date. This rate will be applied to funds allocated to the guaranteed interest option as of the date we receive the full minimum initial premium at our Administrative
Office.    AXA Equitable Life Insurance

Common Questions
Account values



What is my total contract value?
The value of your annuity contract is the sum of the values of each of the investment options in which you are currently invested. The value of each option is determined by the number of units owned for an option multiplied by the most recent business day's price.This value would be reduced by any applicable surrender charges, market value adjustments, contract charges, outstanding loan and any loan interest to determine the net amount that would be available to you. You can view your contract values online, via the AXA web site. Login or Register


How can I obtain investment information on my Variable Annuity?
The AXA web site, your online information source for the status and current values of your MONY life and annuity contracts, does provide you with the most recent closing price for all the investment portfolios you have available to you. Login or Register You can also access monthly and quarterly annualized rates of return for the portfolios available within most of our variable life and annuity contracts. Choose the Performance Information option from the dropdown box on the right side of the Portfolio Summary page.


How can I transfer amounts between investment options in my Variable Annuity?
If you are the Owner, you may transfer amounts between investment options:

Online, through the AXA web site. Login or Register From the Portfolio Summary screen, select "Transfer Funds" from the "Choose an Option" drop down box. 
By mail or fax, completing a Transfer Request Form. Click here for a printable form.

If the Owner of the policy is a corporation or a trust, and not an individual, we require the owner's written request for transfer. Complete and return to the address on the form.



Beneficiary information



What is a Beneficiary?
The beneficiary is the person(s)designated in the contract to receive the death proceeds in the event of the Annuitant/Owner's death.


Can I designate my minor child as beneficiary?
Yes. However, if proceeds become payable to a child during his/her minority, we will pay the court-appointed guardian for the estate of the child. The minor's parent automatically serves as guardian of the minor's person but not his/her estate.
Alternative suggestion: The contract owner should consider designating a Custodian to receive, manage, invest and distribute the proceeds for the minor under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. Ex: John Doe as custodian for Bobby Smith, a minor born 3/3/98, under the NY UTMA. When the minor reaches the age of majority, the custodianship terminates and the balance of any funds are distributed to the child.


Can I designate a revocable trust as beneficiary?
Yes, simply indicate the name of the trustee(s), the name of the trust, the date of the trust and the name(s) of the grantors in Section 1 of the Title Change Form. Sample wording: XYZ Bank as trustee or the successor trustee under an agreement known as the John Smith Living Trust dated 01/01/98, made by and between John Smith and said trustee. Click here for a printable form.


When is my change of beneficiary effective?
Any change of beneficiary will take effect as of the date the form was signed, provided it has been accepted and recorded at our Operations Center, subject to any payment made by us or action taken by us before receipt of the request.


Can I designate multiple persons as primary beneficiary?
Yes. Simply indicate the relationship(s) to the Annuitant(s) along with the full names of the proposed beneficiaries. All primary beneficiaries should be listed in Section 1 under First Beneficiary(ies). Joint beneficiaries will receive equal shares proportionate to the number of those beneficiaries who survive.


What should I do to change my beneficiary now that I am recently married?
A Title Change form (10481) should be completed, dated and signed. Click here for a printable form. Indicate the new beneficiaries in Section 1 (be sure to indicate the full name and relationship of each person to the Annuitant). Your change of name can also be indicated on the form in the space directly under the contract number.


Must I complete a new change of beneficiary request form to reflect a change in the beneficiary's name due to marriage or divorce?
No. Simply write to us at:
MONY Life of AmericaP. O. Box 4830Syracuse, NY 13221
Advise us that your beneficiary, Jane Doe, has changed her name to Jane Smith. Provide her new address, if appropriate. We will make note of this information. No forms are necessary. Please be sure to include your contract number(s).


Can I use one form to change the beneficiary on all of my MONY policies/contracts?
Multiple policies may be indicated on each Title Change form (10481). However, separate forms must be used for each Annuitant, except in the case of a Joint-Life contract. Click here for a printable form.


What is a Rights holder?
The person who can exercise rights is the rights holder of the contract. This term is synonymous with Owner, the individual who can exercise all rights under the provisions of the contract.


How does a Divorce impact my Beneficiary Designation?
If you are required to designate an ex-spouse or children as beneficiary(ies) pursuant to a divorce decree or order, then the decree should be submitted to us. We will conform the beneficiary designation to the terms of the decree. If you currently have your ex-spouse listed as beneficiary, then you should either change the beneficiary to reflect your new choice of beneficiary or to reconfirm your desire to designate the ex-spouse despite the divorce. In most states, a divorce does not automatically extinguish the rights of an ex-spouse as beneficiary. Therefore, an Annuitant who inadvertently leaves his/her ex-spouse as beneficiary of record may cause payment of the death benefits to the ex-spouse even though such payment is contrary to his/her intent.



Death benefits



How do I file a Death Claim?
You can start by filing a Death Benefit Claim. You can also contact Claims at (800) 659-1058.


What documents are required?
Documents required when a claim for death benefits is being filed:

Original annuity contracts (or "life insurance policies") if available. 
A certified copy of the death certificate 
Certificates of appointment (if you are filing as executor, administrator, or in any other fiduciary responsibility) 
Completed Death Claim forms 

Click here for Death Claim forms.


How will I receive the annuity proceeds?
There may be different ways in which you may receive your annuity proceeds. The best payment method for you depends on the amount of your annuity proceeds and your own financial situation. In some cases, a payment method has been chosen for you by the policyholder (or contract holder). But in many cases, you are eligible to choose one or more methods of payment. Some of these options require a minimum amount. Your Financial Professional can help you determine which option is best for you. Note that death claims are payable only on policies/contracts that are in force at the time of Insured's/Annuitant's death.

165 F.Supp.2d 1276 (2001)


Ivey GILMORE, Plaintiff,
v.
MONY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA, Defendant.


United States District Court, M.D. Alabama, Northern Division.
October 9, 2001.








Attorney(s) appearing for the Case
 K. Stephen Jackson, Jeffrey S. Daniel, Jackson & Shuttleworth PC, Birmingham, AL, for Ivey Gilmore, plaintiff.
James W. Gewin, Michael R. Pennington, Julie S. Elmer, Bradley, Arant, Rose & White, LLP, Birmingham, AL, for Mony Life Insurance Company of America, a corporation defendant.





OPINION
MYRON H. THOMPSON, District Judge.
Plaintiff Ivey Gilmore filed this lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Barbour County, Alabama against defendant MONY Life Insurance Company of America alleging several Alabama state-law claims stemming from his purchase of a variable annuity contract from MONY. Gilmore seeks to represent a class of persons similarly situated to himself. MONY removed the lawsuit to this court under the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA), Pub.L. No. 105-353, 112 Stat. 3227, 15 U.S.C.A. § 77p(c), and 28 U.S.C.A. § 1441. This lawsuit is currently before the court on Gilmore's motion to remand and MONY's motion for summary dismissal or judgment on the pleadings. For the reasons that follow, the court will deny Gilmore's motion and grant MONY's "pursuant to SLUSA's directive that all such class actions be based exclusively on federal law." Lander v. Hartford Life & Annuity Insur. Co., 251 F.3d 101, 104 (2nd Cir.2001).
I. FACTUAL SUMMARY
The facts, as alleged by Gilmore, are as follows: Gilmore opened an individual retirement account (IRA) with MONY; the IRA provided for tax deferment on investment earnings. However, a MONY sales agent told Gilmore that, in order to invest in mutual funds on a tax-deferred basis  through his IRA, he would have to purchase a variable annuity. The agent recommended that Gilmore purchase a MONY variable annuity, called the Flexible Payment Variable Annuity Contract, which Gilmore then purchased. Gilmore, however, did not need the variable annuity in order to receive income tax deferral on mutual funds or other investments in his IRA.
On December 10, 1999, Gilmore filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Barbour County, Alabama against MONY. He asserted state-law claims for unjust enrichment, money had and received, conversion, breach of contract, negligent-and-wanton training, negligent-and-wanton supervision, breach of fiduciary duty, deceit, and continuing deceit. Gilmore seeks to represent a class consisting of (1) "[a]ll persons throughout the United States who have purchased a variable annuity from MONY in a tax deferred qualified retirement plan"; (2) "[a]ll persons throughout the United States who were charged unnecessary fees for double tax deferral for variable annuities held in qualified retirement accounts"; and (3) "[a]ll persons throughout the United States who were sold variable annuities while owning a tax deferred qualified retirement plan from MONY." Gilmore requests compensatory damages totaling $ 74,999 for himself and for each putative class member.
MONY filed a notice of removal in this court on January 27, 2000. Gilmore filed a motion to remand on February 25, 2000. On March 10, 2000, MONY filed a motion for summary dismissal or judgment on the pleadings.
II. DISCUSSION
MONY removed this lawsuit based on four theories of federal jurisdiction. First, according to MONY, Gilmore's claims are superpreempted by SLUSA, and, therefore, Gilmore's lawsuit is removable under 15 U.S.C.A. § 77p(c). Second, MONY contends that Gilmore's claims are superpreempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.A. §§ 1001-1461. Third, MONY contends that Gilmore's lawsuit presents a federal question because federal tax laws form an integral element of his state-law claims. And, fourth, MONY contends that the court has diversity jurisdiction over Gilmore's claims. Gilmore disagrees with each of MONY's theories.
Under SLUSA, a private party cannot maintain certain class-action law-suits alleging violations of state law in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. Specifically, subsection (b) of § 77p of SLUSA provides:
"No covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any State or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any State or Federal court by any private party alleging —
(1) an untrue statement or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security; or
(2) that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security."
15 U.S.C.A. § 77p(b). And subsection (c) of § 77p provides that a class-action lawsuit brought in state court that satisfies subsection (b) is removable to federal court: "Any covered class action brought in any State court involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection (b), shall be removable to the Federal district court for the district in which the action is pending, and shall be subject to subsection (b)." 15 U.S.C.A. § 77p(c). As a result, subsections (b) and (c) together provide for the removal and dismissal of certain lawsuits based on state law. Through SLUSA and other statutes, Congress intended to preempt state law and "provide national,  uniform standards for the securities market and nationally marketed securities." Lander v. Hartford Life & Annuity Insur. Co., 251 F.3d at 111.
MONY contends that Gilmore's lawsuit is subject to removal and dismissal because it satisfies the requirements of subsections (b) and (c). In response, Gilmore argues that the MONY variable annuity is not a "covered security" as required by SLUSA in subsections (b) and (c) of § 77p.1 Instead, Gilmore contends that MONY is an insurance company that is regulated under state insurance laws and that the MONY variable annuity is an insurance product. In addition, according to Gilmore, even if the MONY variable annuity satisfies the definition of a "covered security," the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1011-1015, operates to preclude the construction of "covered security" to include insurance products, such as the MONY variable annuity.
Gilmore does not dispute that his lawsuit is a "covered class action" as required by subsections (b) and (c) of § 77p. Therefore, for purposes of resolving the motions currently before the court, the only issue in dispute is whether the MONY variable annuity is a "covered security."
The SLUSA adopts the definition of "covered security" given subsection (2) of 15 U.S.C.A. § 77r(b).2 See 15 U.S.C.A. § 77p(f)(3). Subsection (2) provides: "Exclusive Federal registration of investment companies [:] A security is a covered security if such security is a security issued by an investment company that has registered, or that has filed a registration statement,  under the Investment Company Act of 1940." 15 U.S.C.A. § 77r(b).
Subsection 2) contains three requirements, each of which must be satisfied in order to have a "covered security": (1) there must be a security; (2) the issuer or the security must be an investment company; and (3) the investment company must be registered, or have filed a registration statement, under the Investment Company Act of 1940. See 15 U.S.C.A. § 77r(b)(2). The court will examine whether each of these elements is satisfied in the present case.
In Securities and Exchange Commission v. Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company of America, 359 U.S. 65, 79 S.Ct. 618, 3 L.Ed.2d 640 (1959), the Supreme Court considered whether variable annuities are `securities.' There, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought to enjoin Variable Annuity Life from issuing its variable annuity contracts to the public without registering them under the Securities Act of 1933 and complying with the Investment Company Act of 1940. See 359 U.S. at 66, 79 S.Ct. at 619. The SEC maintained that the variable annuities are "securities" and, therefore, must be registered. See id. at 66-68, 79 S.Ct. at 619-20. Variable Annuity Life responded that its variable annuities are contracts of insurance and thus are expressly exempt from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws. See id. at 67, 79 S.Ct. at 620. It also argued that, even if the variable annuities are "securities," the McCarran-Ferguson Act bars the SEC from requiring their registration because Variable Annuity Life and the variable annuities are regulated under state insurance laws. See id. at 67, 79 S.Ct. at 619-20.
Agreeing with the SEC, the Supreme Court held that variable annuities are "securities," not insurance, and therefore that neither the McCarran-Ferguson Act nor the exemptions to the federal securities laws save Variable Annuity Life's variable annuities from the SEC's registration requirements. See id. at 71-72, 79 S.Ct. at 622.
In reaching its holding, the Supreme Court began by comparing traditional fixed annuities with variable annuities. See id. at 69-70, 79 S.Ct. at 621. The Court found that fixed annuities offer the annuitant specified, definite amounts beginning with a certain year of his or her life, see id. at 69, 79 S.Ct. at 621; in contrast, with variable annuities, premiums are invested more heavily in stocks, and benefit payments vary with the success of the investment policy. See id. "The holder of a variable annuity cannot look forward to a fixed monthly or yearly amount in his advancing years. It may be greater or less, depending on the wisdom of the investment policy." Id.
The Supreme Court acknowledged that actuarially fixed and variable annuities are calculated by identical principles. See id. Specifically, with each type of annuity, the issuer assumes the risk of mortality from the moment the contract is issued. See id. Even so, according to the Court, the dispositive difference between the two types of annuities is that "absent some guarantee of fixed income, the variable annuity places all of the investment risks on the annuitant, none on the company," while the fixed annuity places those risks on the company. Id. at 71, 79 S.Ct. at 621. That difference precludes variable annuities from being insurance because "the concept of `insurance' involves some investment risk-taking on the part of the company." Id. at 71, 79 S.Ct. at 622. Insurance requires a guarantee that at least some fraction of the benefits will be payable in a fixed amount. See id. Although the companies that issue variable annuities assume the risk of failure, they do not guarantee  anything to the annuitants except an interest in a portfolio of common stocks or other equities, "an interest that has a ceiling but not floor." Id. at 71-72, 79 S.Ct. at 622. As such, the Court concluded that variable annuities present the issuer with no true underwriting risk, the earmark of insurance. See id. at 72, 79 S.Ct. at 622-23.
In Securities and Exchange Commission v. United Benefit Life Insurance Company, 387 U.S. 202, 87 S.Ct. 1557, 18 L.Ed.2d 673 (1967), the Supreme Court expressly clarified the implications of Variable Annuity Life. There, the SEC sought to enjoin United Benefit Life from offering its Flexible Fund Annuity contract without undertaking the registration requirements of federal securities laws. See 387 U.S. at 204, 87 S.Ct. at 1558. The Flexible Fund is a deferred annuity plan having characteristics similar to those of the variable annuities in Variable Annuity Life. See id. However, the Supreme Court found that there are significant differences between the Flexible Fund and the variable annuities at issue in Variable Annuity Life. See id. United Benefit Life claimed that these differences bring the Flexible Fund within the "optional annuity contract" and "insurance company" exemptions of federal securities laws. See id. at 204-05, 87 S.Ct. at 1558-59.
To resolve the issue, the Supreme Court examined the characteristics of the Flexible Fund. See id. at 205, 87 S.Ct. at 1559. It found that the major part of the Flexible Fund is invested in common stocks. See id. Prior to the Flexible Fund's maturity, purchasers are entitled to their proportionate share of the Flexible Fund and may withdraw all or part of this interest. See id. The purchasers are also entitled to an alternative cash value measured by a percentage of their net premiums. See id. At the Flexible Fund's maturity, the purchasers are entitled to receive either the cash value of their policies or a net premium payment, which is a certain fixed-amount payment life annuity. See id. at 205-06, 87 S.Ct. at 1559.
In the district court, the parties agreed that the provisions of the Flexible Fund dealing with the operation of the fixed-payment annuity at maturity were purely conventional insurance provisions, and thus are beyond regulation by the SEC. See id. at 206, 87 S.Ct. at 1559. However, the SEC argued that the portion of the Flexible Fund that dealt with the prematurity, or accumulation, period was separable and constituted a `security.' See id. The district court rejected the SEC's position and found that the entire Flexible Fund is an insurance contract because it provided a guarantee of a fixed-payment annuity. See id. Relying on Variable Annuity Life, the court of appeals affirmed. See id. The appellate court read Variable Annuity Life to hold that the company must bear a substantial part of the investment risk associated with the contract in order to qualify its products as insurance. See id. at 206-07, 87 S.Ct. at 1559. The appellate court held that the Flexible Fund met this test because of the Fund's net premium guarantee and conversion to payments element, which included an interest element during the fixed-payment period. See id. at 207, 87 S.Ct. at 1559-60. The Supreme Court reversed. See id. at 207-12, 87 S.Ct. at 1560-63.
The Supreme Court agreed with the SEC that the Flexible Fund's accumulation period is separable and must be assessed independently of the maturity period. See id. at 207-10, 87 S.Ct. at 1560-61. The Court reasoned that the accumulation period and the maturity period present two entirely distinct promises and their operation is separated at a fixed point in time. See id. at 207, 87 S.Ct. at 1560. Specifically, during the accumulation period,  United Benefit Life "promises to serve as an investment agency and allow[s] the policyholder to share in its investment experience." Id. at 208, 87 S.Ct. at 1560. In contrast, during the maturity period, United Benefit Life is acting in a role similar to that of a savings institution. See id.
Under these circumstances, the Supreme Court held that the accumulation portion of the Flexible Fund does not constitute insurance. See id. at 210-11, 87 S.Ct. at 1562. "[W]hile the guarantee of cash value based on net premiums reduces substantially the investment risk of the contract holder, the assumption of an investment risk [by the company] cannot by itself create an insurance provision...." Id. at 211, 87 S.Ct. at 1562. The Supreme Court stated that the appellate court read Variable Annuity Life too narrowly when it interpreted that decision to have turned solely on the absence of any substantial investment risk-taking on the part of the insurer. See id. at 210, 87 S.Ct. at 1561-62.
The United Benefit Life Court further held that the accumulation provisions of the Flexible Fund constitute an "investment contract" under federal securities laws. See id. at 211, 87 S.Ct. at 1562. As such, the Supreme Court concluded that the accumulation provisions of the Flexible Fund are nonexempt securities and must be registered with the SEC. See id. at 212, 87 S.Ct. at 1562.
Under United Benefit Life, the touchstone for determining whether a variable annuity is not insurance, for purposes of the McCarran-Ferguson Act and exceptions to federal securities laws, is whether its issuer "promises to serve as an investment agency ... allow[ing] the policyholder to share in its investment experience." Id. at 208, 87 S.Ct. at 1560. The assumption of an investment risk by the issuer does not alone allow a variable annuity to constitute insurance. See id. at 210-11, 87 S.Ct. at 1561-62. In light of these principles, the court will examine the terms of the MONY variable annuity to determine whether it is insurance.
The MONY variable annuity provides that the annuitant must make purchase payments to MONY. The annuitant's purchase payments are allocated, at the annuitant's choice, to the Guaranteed Interest Account and/or the subaccounts of MONY America Variable Account A. Those purchase payments can accumulate for a period of time and create `cash values' for the annuitant. The annuitant may chose the length of time such purchase payments accumulate and may also chose to receive annuity benefit payments in the future based upon the accumulated "cash values."
MONY America Variable Account A is a separate investment account of MONY. Only purchase payments for the MONY variable annuity are permitted to be allocated to the MONY America Variable Account A. The assets in the MONY America Variable Account A are kept separate from MONY's other assets and accounts of MONY. The MONY America Variable Account A consists of nine subaccounts. The annuitant may allocate some or all of his purchase payments into one or more of these subaccounts. Each of these subaccounts invests in, among other things, money market instruments, bonds, and stocks. The purchase payments allocated "among the various subaccounts on MONY America Variable Account A may increase or decrease in value on any day depending on the investment experience of the subaccounts ... select[ed]. There is no guarantee that the value of the purchase payments ... allocate[d] to any of the subaccounts ... will increase or that the purchase payments [made] will not lose value." Similarly, the annuitant "bear[s] the entire investment risk for all  amounts allocated to MONY America Variable Account A subaccounts."
Unlike the MONY America Variable Account A, the Guaranteed Interest Account is part of MONY's general account. Purchase payments allocated to the Guaranteed Interest Account earn an interest rate to be determined by MONY, but not less than 3.5 %.
The court finds that the MONY variable annuity is similar to the Flexible Fund in United Benefit Life in that it contains a portion — the MONY America Variable Account A — which, like the accumulation portion of the Flexible Fund, places all of the investment risk on the purchaser and another portion — the Guaranteed Interest Account — which, like the maturity portion of the Flexible Fund, offers the annuitant a fixed return. This similarity to the Flexible Fund requires the court to analyze the MONY America Variable Account A separate from the Guaranteed Interest Account for purposes of determining whether the MONY America Variable Account A is insurance or a security.3 Moreover, the facts of this case warrant analyzing the MONY America Variable Account A separately. Specifically, only the MONY America Variable Account A is relevant to Gilmore because he opted to allocate 100% of his purchase payments to three of its subaccounts. Gilmore did not allocate any of his purchase payments to the Guaranteed Interest Account. For these reasons, the court will examine the MONY America Variable Account A separately to determine whether it is insurance or a security.
As discussed, under the MONY America Variable Account A, the annuitant allocates his purchase payments to subaccounts each of which invests in money market instruments, bonds, stocks, and like instruments. The purchase payments allocated "among the various subaccounts on MONY America Variable Account A may increase or decrease in value on any day depending on the investment experience of the subaccounts ... select[ed]." The annuitant "bear[s] the entire investment risk for all amounts allocated to MONY America Variable Account A subaccounts." In other words, MONY has promised to serve as the annuitant's investment agency, expressly allowing the annuitant to share in the subaccounts' investment experience, be it good or bad. Under similar circumstances, the United Benefits Life Court held that the accumulation portion of the Flexible Fund is not insurance. See id. at 211, 87 S.Ct. at 1562. Therefore, the MONY America Variable Account A is not insurance.
The McCarran-Ferguson Act provides, in relevant part, that "[n]o Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance ... unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance." 15 U.S.C.A. § 1012(b). Because the MONY America Variable Account A is not insurance, the McCarran-Ferguson does not preclude construing the MONY America Variable Account A to be a "covered security." See Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 210-11, 99 S.Ct. 1067, 1073, 59 L.Ed.2d 261 (1979) (recognizing that the McCarran-Ferguson Act applies to the "business of insurance," not the "business of insurers," so as to not exempt from federal antitrust laws insurers' actions which are not properly characterized as the "business of insurance"); Securities and Exch. Comm'n v. National Sec., Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 459-60,  89 S.Ct. 564, 568, 21 L.Ed.2d 668 (1969) (stating that the McCarran-Ferguson Act applies to insurance companies "only when they are engaged in the `business of insurance' "); see also Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. of Am., 359 U.S. at 71-73, 79 S.Ct. at 622-23.
The next issue is whether the MONY America Variable Account A is a "security." Federal securities laws define "security" to include an investment contract. See 15 U.S.C.A. § 77b(a)(1).4 The Supreme Court has defined "investment contract," as used in § 77b(a)(1), to mean "a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party...." Securities and Exch. Comm'n v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 298-99, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1103, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946). The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has divided the Howey test into three elements: " `(1) an investment of money, (2) a common enterprise, and (3) the expectation of profits to be derived solely from the efforts of others.'" Securities and Exch. Comm'n v. Unique Fin. Concepts, Inc., 196 F.3d 1195, 1199 (11th Cir.1999) (quoting Villeneuve v. Advanced Bus. Concepts Corp., 698 F.2d 1121, 1124 (11th Cir.1983)). The MONY America Variable Account A satisfies the Howey test.
Under the first prong of the Howey test, an "investment of money" refers to an arrangement whereby an investor commits assets to an enterprise or venture in such a manner as to subject himself to financial loss. See Securities and Exch. Comm'n v. Friendly Power Co., LLC, 49 F.Supp.2d 1363, 1368-69 (S.D.Fla.1999). The MONY variable annuity requires the annuitant to make purchase payments, for which he or she bears the entire investment risk when they are allocated to the MONY America Variable Account A. Therefore, the MONY America Variable Account A satisfies the "investment of money" prong.
The second, or "common enterprise," prong is satisfied "where `the fortunes of the investor are interwoven with and dependent on the efforts and success of those seeking the investment or of third parties.'" Unique Fin. Concepts, Inc., 196 F.3d at 1199 (quoting Villeneuve, 698 F.2d at 1124). The MONY America Variable Account A consists of nine subaccounts in which annuitants may opt to invest their purchase payments. Each of these subaccounts invests in, among other things, money market instruments, bonds, and stocks. As such, each subaccount is not dependent upon the success of either the annuitant or MONY but, instead, upon the success of those seeking the investment or a third party. Therefore, the MONY America Variable Account A is a "common enterprise."
 The third Howey prong requires that investors expect their profits to come solely from the efforts of others. See 196 F.3d at 1201. " `[T]he crucial inquiry [for the third prong] is the amount of control that the investors retain under their written agreements.'" Id. (quoting Albanese v. Florida Nat'l Bank, 823 F.2d 408, 410 (11th Cir.1987)).
As discussed, the MONY variable annuity allows annuitants to choose the subaccounts of the MONY America Variable Account A into which their purchase payments are invested. Each subaccount has a specified investment objective. Therefore, once an annuitant chooses in which subaccounts to invest, he or she effectively surrenders control of his or her money to the subaccounts' managers, as long as the money remains in those subaccounts. In other words, annuitants depend on the investment expertise of others once they designate into which subaccounts their purchase payments will be invested. As a result, the MONY America Variable Annuity A meets the third prong of the Howey test.
Because the MONY America Variable Account A satisfies the Howey test the court finds that it is an "investment contract" and thus a "security." The next issue is whether the MONY America Variable Account A is issued by an "investment company."
The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides that an
" `investment company' means any issuer which —
(A) is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities;
(B) is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of issuing face-amount certificates of the installment type, or has been engaged in such business and has any such certificate outstanding; or
(C) is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 per centum of the value of such issuer's total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis."
15 U.S.C.A. § 80a-3(a)(1).
MONY argues that the MONY America Variable Account A itself is an "issuer" that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, namely, the MONY America Variable Account A. Therefore, MONY argues, the MONY America Variable Account A is issued by an "investment company."
In response, Gilmore concedes that the MONY America Variable Account A is a "separate investment vehicle" of MONY's that "is registered with the Securities Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a unit investment trust, which is a type of investment company." However, Gilmore contends that MONY is the issuer of the MONY America Variable Account A and that because MONY is an insurance company it is expressly exempted from the definition of "investment company." In support of his position, Gilmore relies solely on Prudential Insurance Company of America v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 326 F.2d 383 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 953, 84 S.Ct. 1629, 12 L.Ed.2d 497 (1964).
Gilmore is correct that Prudential Insurance Company directly addresses the issue of whether the MONY America Variable Account A is issued by an "investment company." However, the court is surprised that Gilmore relies on Prudential Insurance Company because that decision directly contradicts Gilmore's position.
 The issue in Prudential Insurance Company was whether the Investment Company Act of 1940 applies to the Investment Fund resulting from the sale of variable annuity contracts to members of the public by Prudential Insurance Company of America. See 326 F.2d at 384. The variable annuity contracts that Prudential proposed to sell provide that the purchaser will make monthly purchase payments of fixed amounts over a period of years. See id. The purchase payments will be placed in an account, managed by Prudential, consisting of two subaccounts. See id. The first subaccount, the Investment Fund account, will have its assets invested primarily in common stocks. See id. The Investment Fund will be dedicated solely to the variable annuity contract holders and its assets will not be subject to claims of any other contract or policyholder of Prudential. See id. at 384-85. The second subaccount, the Other Assets account, is an administrative account that pays dividends to contract holders. See id. at 385.
At the administrative level before the SEC, Prudential argued that it was not required to comply with the Investment Company Act of 1940 because that Act specifically excludes insurance companies, such as itself, from its scope. See id. The SEC agreed that Prudential itself is not an "investment company" and, therefore, is excluded from the Act. See id. However, the SEC determined that the Investment Fund, created by Prudential, is an "investment company" within the coverage of the Act. See id. The SEC reasoned that the variable annuity contracts render the purchasers an "organized group of persons"; that the variable annuity contracts create a "trust" held by Prudential for these purchasers; and that the Investment Fund, which results from the sale of the variable annuity contracts, is a "fund" within the statutory definition. See id. at 386. As a result, the SEC concluded that the Investment Fund is the "issuer" of the variable annuity contracts and thus is an "investment company" subject to the Act. See id. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit agreed. See id. at 388.
Before the appellate court, Prudential argued that the Investment Company Act of 1940 regulates only identifiable business entities with some sort of internal organization. See id. at 386. Prudential acknowledged that it is such an entity but argued that the Investment Fund is not. See id. Therefore, according to Prudential, the Investment Fund is not subject to the statute. See id.
In rejecting Prudential's argument, the appellate court relied primarily on the legislative history of the Investment Company Act of 1940. See id. at 387. The appellate court found that the Committee reports of both the House and the Senate state that the Investment Company Act of 1940 was drafted principally on the basis of reports submitted by the SEC following an extensive study of investment trusts and investment companies undertaken at the direction of Congress. See id. Investment companies referred to in these reports included
"those involving `an agency relationship between the individual contributors to the fund and the management upon whom they confer substantially a power of attorney to act as agent in the investment of the moneys contributed. The group of individual investors is not a legal entity but rather constitutes in essence a combination of distinct individual interests.'"
Id. (quoting H.R.Doc. No. 707, 75th Cong., 3rd Sess. 24 (1939)). The appellate court also found significant the fact that the reports referred to an investment company known as the "Alexander Fund," which the reports described as "`merely a descriptive name given to the commingled funds of numerous investors who employed W.  Wallace Alexander as their agent to invest such funds.'" Id. (quoting H.R.Doc. No. 707, 75th Cong., 3rd Sess. 46 (1939)).
Under these circumstances, the appellate court rejected Prudential's argument that the broad statutory phrase "`a trust, a fund, or any organized group of persons whether incorporated or not' refers only to recognizable business entities." Id. Instead, the court found that the legislative history compels the conclusion that the Investment Fund is a "fund" as that term is used in the statute. See id. In so finding, the court found three facts significant. First, the Investment Fund is a completely segregated account, devoted to investing in securities. See id. Second, the cash for these investments is derived from payments made by the purchaser of the variable annuity contract. See id. And, third, it is the Investment Fund, and no other entity, in which the purchaser has an interest. See id. Therefore, the appellate court concluded that the Investment Fund is separable from the insurance company. See id. Accordingly, the appellate court further concluded that the Investment Fund, not Prudential, is the "issuer" of these securities for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. See id. at 388. "Prudential would in fact be the writer of the contracts — the insurance and annuity promises and the obligation to set up the investment fund. But the [I]nvestment [F]und, the `company' to which the investment interests relate, is the `issuer' of those interests." Id. (internal quotations omitted).
The MONY variable annuity is materially identical to the variable annuity contracts at issue in Prudential Insurance Company. Specifically, like the variable annuity contracts, the MONY variable annuity provides that, first, the purchaser will make monthly purchase payments of fixed amounts over a period of years; second, the purchase payments will be placed into one or both of two funds — the MONY America Variable Account A and the Guaranteed Interest Account — which are managed by MONY; and, third, the relevant fund — the MONY America Variable Account A — has its assets invested primarily in securities and will be dedicated solely to the variable annuity contract holders, and its assets will not be subject to claims of any other contract or policyholder of MONY. Furthermore, like Prudential, Gilmore argues that the definition of "investment company" in the Investment Company Act of 1940 applies only to identifiable businesses, of which MONY but not the MONY America Variable Account A is one. On the other hand, like the SEC in Prudential Insurance Company, MONY argues that it is separable from the MONY America Variable Account A for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Therefore, the material facts of Prudential Insurance Company are identical to those in the case at bar.
Here, the court finds that the reasoning of Prudential Insurance Company is persuasive and adopts the reasoning of Prudential Insurance Company and applies it here. The court, accordingly, finds that, for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the MONY America Variable Account A is separable from MONY, MONY America Variable Account A is the "issuer" of the MONY variable annuity,5 and MONY America Variable Account A is, therefore, an "investment company." See id. Gilmore concedes that the MONY America Variable Account A is registered  under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
In sum, because the MONY America Variable Account A is a "security" issued by an "investment company" that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, it is a "covered security" under SLUSA. As discussed, the only issue in dispute in this matter is whether Gilmore's claims stem from his purchase of a "covered security." Because the court has answered that question in the affirmative, Gilmore's lawsuit satisfies the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of 15 U.S.C.A. § 77p and accordingly is removable to this court and then due to be dismissed under SLUSA.6 See Lander v. Hartford Life & Annuity Insur. Co., 251 F.3d 101 (2nd Cir.2001) (purchasers' state-court class-action lawsuit was a "covered class action" under SLUSA; variable annuity contracts were "covered securities" under SLUSA; McCarran-Ferguson Act did not preclude application of SLUSA; and, as a result, state-court class-action lawsuit was removable to federal court and then due to be dismissed under SLUSA).
A separate and appropriate judgment will be entered.
JUDGMENT
In accordance with the memorandum opinion entered today, it is the ORDER, JUDGMENT, and DECREE of this court that:
(1) The motion to remand, filed by Plaintiff Ivey Gilmore on February 25, 2000, is denied.
(2) The motion for summary dismissal or judgment on the pleadings, filed by defendant MONY Life Insurance Company of America on March 10, 2000, is granted, and this cause is dismissed without prejudice.
It is further ORDERED that all other pending motions are denied as moot.
15 U.S.C.A. § 77p(f)(2)(A).


FootNotes 
1. A "covered class action" means
"(i) any single lawsuit in which —
(I) damages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons or prospective class members, and questions of law or fact common to those persons or members of the prospective class, without reference to issues of individualized reliance on an alleged misstatement or omission, predominate over any questions affecting only individual persons or members; or
(II) one or more named parties seek to recover damages on a representative basis on behalf of themselves and other unnamed parties similarly situated, and questions of law or fact common to those persons or members of the prospective class predominate over any questions affecting only individual persons or members; or
(ii) any group of lawsuits filed in or pending in the same court and involving common questions of law or fact, in which —
(I) damages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons; and
(II) the lawsuits are joined, consolidated, or otherwise proceed as a single action for any purpose."
15 U.S.C.A. § 77p(f)(2)(A).

2. Section 77r(b) provides:
"For purposes of this section, the following are covered securities:
(1) Exclusive Federal registration of nationally traded securities
A security is a covered security if such security is —
(A) listed, or authorized for listing, on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, or listed, or authorized for listing, on the National Market System of the Nasdaq Stock Market (or any successor to such entities);
(B) listed, or authorized for listing, on a national securities exchange (or tier or segment thereof) that has listing standards that the Commission determines by rule (on its own initiative or on the basis of a petition) are substantially similar to the listing standards applicable to securities described in subparagraph (A); or
(C) is a security of the same issuer that is equal in seniority or that is a senior security to a security described in subparagraph (A) or (B).
(2) Exclusive Federal registration of investment companies
A security is a covered security if such security is a security issued by an investment company that his registered, or that has filed a registration statement, under the Investment Company Act of 1940."
15 U.S.C.A. § 77r(b).

3. Unlike the Flexible Fund, the MONY variable annuity annuitant does not necessarily possess both portions because he may allocate 100 % of his purchase payments to either the MONY America Variable Account A or the Guaranteed Interest Account. However, this distinction is not relevant to the case at bar.

4. Under the federal securities laws the term "security" means
"any note, stock, treasury stock, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a `security', or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing."
15 U.S.C.A. § 77b(a)(1).

5. The Investment Company Act of 1940 defines "issuer" as "every person who issues or proposes to issue any security, or has outstanding any security which it has issued." 15 U.S.C.A. § 80a-2(a)(22). Issuer was defined in a materially identical manner at the time of the Prudential Insurance Company of America decision. See 326 F.2d at 386 n. 4.

6. Because Gilmore's lawsuit is removable under section 77p(b) the court will not address MONY's alternative theories of removal jurisdiction.

                        The available cash value of any dividend additions and/or deposits may be:
                    

withdrawn in cash
used to pay premiums on the same policy
used to repay outstanding loan balances


                        Such withdrawals will affect the total death benefit payable but
                        will not affect the base policy face amounts.
                    

                        If you would like to with withdraw your dividends please contact Customer

                        website here. We will send you confirmation in the mail of the change.
                    







                        How do I transfer amounts between investment options in my Variable Life policy?
                    





                        Fund Transfers can be processed when a specific Fund Transfer Form is completed.

                        How do I understand a policy loan affecting my coverage?
                    





                        Any outstanding indebtedness will be deducted from the
                        proceeds payable at lapse, surrender, maturity, or payment
                        of the death claim. Therefore, it is in the client's best
                        interest to make loan repayments whenever possible. Loan
                        repayments will also reduce future loan interest payments.
                    







                        How do I get a copy of my policy?
                    





                        You can contact customer service at 800-487-6669 and we
                        will provide you with a duplicate policy for a $35.00 fee or a
                        Certificate of Insurance free of charge.
                    







                        Is my spouse's signature required on the beneficiary change form?
                    





                        If you live in a community property state, we recommend that your
                        spouse does sign the form.
                    







                        Beneficiary
                    





                        The person, persons, or other entity designated to receive
                        the policy proceeds.
                    







                        Cash value
                    





                        Cash value is equal to the policy value less a surrender charge
                        and outstanding loan, if any. Cash value can provide a source of
                        funds for the policyowner through loans, partial surrender or
                        full surrender.
                    







                        Death Benefit
                    





                        The death benefit is the amount of money paid to the beneficiary
                        at the time of the insured's death.
                    







                        Death Benefit Option
                    





                        A level death benefit option means the death benefit only includes
                        the face amount of the policy. An increasing death benefit means the
                        death benefit includes the face amount of the policy and policy value.
                    







                        Dividend Options
                    





                        The dividends may be paid in cash each year, kept on the policy
                        to accumulate, earning interest, purchase additional insurance,
                        or be used to pay part of the premium or outstanding loan amount.
                    







                        Endowment Policy
                    





                        Endowments are policies in which the cash value built up inside the
                        policy, equals the death benefit (face amount) at a certain age.
                        The age this commences is known as the endowment age. Endowments are
                        considerably more expensive (in terms of annual premiums) than either
                        whole life or universal life because the premium paying period is shortened
                        and the endowment date is earlier.  Endowment Insurance is paid out
                        whether the insured lives or dies, after a specific period.

                        A policy illustration gives you a projection of future values
                        for your policy. The projection shows premiums, cash values,
                        and death benefit amounts on a year-by-year basis.

                        The Insured is the person whose life the policy insures. The
                        Insured is the Owner of the policy unless someone else is named
                        as Owner.
                    







                        Interest Sensitive Whole Life Policy
                    





                        Interest Sensitive Whole Life (ISWL) is a guaranteed fixed level
                        premium non-participating permanent life insurance policy that
                        offers insurance protection and Cash Value Accumulation. Thesecon
                        MONY ISWL delivers in one product what consumers find the most
                        desirable features of Whole Life and Universal Life Insurance.
                    







                        Last Survivor Universal Life Policy
                    





                        Survivorship, or second-to-die, insurance simultaneously covers
                        two lives and pays a death benefit upon the second death. Survivorship
                        Universal Life provides premium flexibility without losing coverage,
                        so long as the cash value of the policy is sufficient to cover the
                        necessary monthly deductions to maintain coverage. The potential
                        for cash value accumulation is based on the crediting of a competitive
                        interest rate to the fund value on a monthly basis.
                    







                        Last Survivor Variable Universal Life Policy

                        Last Survivor Whole Life Policy
                    





                        Survivorship, or second -to-die, insurance simultaneously covers two
                        lives and pays a death benefit upon the second death.  Last survivor
                        whole life insurance remains in-force during the lifetime of the last
                        insured provided that the premiums are paid as specified in the policy
                        contract.
                    







                        Level Term Life Insurance Policy
                    





                        This is a life insurance policy that provides coverage for a limited
                        period of time with consistent premiums over the length of the coverage.
                    







                        Partial Surrender
                    





                        A partial surrender is simply taking available cash value from the
                        policy while keeping the policy in-force. This action will decrease the
                        death benefit. Partial surrenders may affect how long your policy will
                        stay in-force. Therefore, you may need to increase your premium at some
                        time.

                        This generally represents the face amount of the base policy, the

                        A Universal Life Policy provides either a level or increasing death
                        benefit. The premium can be flexible if there is enough cash value

                        and partial surrenders are permitted on Universal Life policies.
                        However, premiums may need to be increased when loans or partial
                        surrenders are made to offset the monthly mortality and expense charges.
