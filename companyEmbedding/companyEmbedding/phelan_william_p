Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Virginia Credit Union


                                            I was pre qualified for a mortgage loan. They waited until the week before closing and decided that I did not qualify.  This was after i put $500.00 down and paid for the inspection and gave notice to where I was renting .

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

                Code:
            

                A1            













Abstract:

            A method and system for processing tax pertaining to a transaction between a seller and buyer. The transaction triggers a tax due to a tax imposing jurisdiction (TIJ). The transaction has been authorized to be financed for the tax due to the TIJ by a financing network. First transaction data fields are received as data that includes an indication of the tax due to the TIJ and is sufficient for determining the tax due to the TIJ. Second transaction data fields are generated as a copy of the first transaction data fields. A tax transaction identification is assigned to the transaction and appended to the second transaction data fields. An audit and verify process is performed on the second transaction data fields. Results of the audit and verify process are merged into the second transaction data fields. The second transaction data fields are transferred to a transaction data warehouse.

Related Art Buyers of goods and services are becoming quite sophisticated about making purchases of products from sellers who are located outside of the buyer's sales or consumption tax imposing jurisdiction. For example, many buyers purchase products on the Internet. The seller is not responsible for the collection of tax from buyers outside of their jurisdiction, so no sales or consumption tax is collected. Many buyers of goods and services are technically responsible for the voluntary payment of a “use tax” on such purchases, but fail to pay such taxes to the tax imposing jurisdiction in which they reside either because the buyers are not aware of laws governing use tax, or the buyers are simply not going to voluntarily comply with such laws. Thus, tax imposing jurisdictions are experiencing a decline in reported taxable transactions involving goods and services and an associated decline in tax revenues. Each tax imposing jurisdiction finds it difficult to force compliance, since no comprehensive system of compliance currently exists to require buyers and sellers to comply with the applicable laws that should be applied to the transactions in question. In addition, tax imposing jurisdictions, as well as sellers serving as tax agents for the tax imposing jurisdictions, incur substantial collection, administrative, and compliance costs relating to taxes due to the complexity of tax laws which are different across different tax imposing jurisdictions. Thus, there is a need for a method and system that enables a tax imposing jurisdiction to collect taxes from a buyer residing therein for a transaction between the buyer and seller, where the seller is not legally responsible for the collection of such tax. There is also a need for a method and system that simplifies the collection, administration, and compliance process relating to such taxes, while taking into consideration the reality that tax laws will vary among different tax imposing jurisdictions, reflecting the needs of different tax imposing jurisdictions.

Appendix A includes definitions of selected words and phrases appearing herein. Appendix A also serves as a glossary that includes examples illustrating and/or clarifying some of the definitions appearing in Appendix A. The present invention relates processing a “goods and services transaction”, which is a transaction of at least one good and/or a least one service between a merchant (i.e., seller) and a buyer, said transaction having a transaction value payable by the buyer and receivable by the seller, said transaction triggering a tax due to at least one tax imposing jurisdiction (TIJ), said tax due to each TIJ being specific to each TIJ, said buyer being liable for the tax due to each TIJ. The present invention provides a local network, for auditing and transferring transactional and/or consumption based taxes directly to taxing levying authorities. The present invention is directed to methods, computer-based systems and related computer hardware and software products and implementations that will audit and verify tax calculations relating to transactions as (a) the transaction is being authorized for payment in an electronic payment network and/or electronic network, or (b) funds relating to such transactions have been collected by an Electronic Payment Network (EPN) and/or Electronic Network (EN) without an automated authorization process occurring. The Network System of the present invention performs an audit and verify process if the tax laws of appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions are being properly applied to a transaction based upon the data provided by the seller of goods or services and create additional information that can be used by tax imposing jurisdictions through a Clearinghouse for self-directed analysis, collection, compliance, and administrative purposes. To the extent that the audit and verify process determines, based upon the tax laws of the tax imposing jurisdiction, that a tax liability is due from a buyer/consumer and such tax is not the responsibility of the seller to collect, the network system applies the rules of the tax imposing jurisdiction to assist in resolving the matter. The resolution options might include, but not be limited to, immediately charging the same credit card used by the buyer for the purchase of goods or services, to the extent permitted by the laws of the tax imposing jurisdictions as well as any required permissions required between the credit card holder and the credit card company. Other solutions relating to tax collection may include the tax imposing jurisdiction charging additional taxes or penalties to be added to the personal or corporate income tax returns of the party for which there is a tax liability. Another solution might be to enable the buyer/consumer to “opt-in” to a plan that would automatically charge a credit card at the end of the next credit card billing period, or face fines and penalties that would increase after initial notifications were provided. Such notifications might be included in the normal billing statement of the credit/debit card company employed to make the purchase that triggered the associated tax liability. Data in the system is aggregated in a Transaction Data Warehouse (denoted as Database 106 in FIG. 1 and described infra) and made available to tax imposing jurisdictions through a Clearinghouse repository. The tax imposing jurisdictions will have access to appropriate transaction data directly, or by employing the assistance of approved government service providers (“GSP” or “GSPs”). Access to the Transaction Data Warehouse and associated Clearinghouse may be based on and Open Standards architecture and may employ an Application Program Interface (“API”) The present invention, including the methods, principles, computer-based systems and related hardware and software products and implementations, are collectively referred to as a “Network System.”The Network System addresses all of the preceding issues. The Network System leverages and extends existing Electronic Networks and Electronic Payment Networks to create a low-cost infrastructure focused on the needs of tax imposing jurisdictions, as well as the needs of sellers to reduce their role and administrative expense in the collection of tax that is fundamentally imposed on the consumption of goods and services by buyers. Tax imposing jurisdictions are provided with the capability for frequent or more immediate access to information on transactions, tax calculations, and tax finds in a secure Clearinghouse environment. Certain transactions that are passing into or through the network may be selected to be audited and verified electronically, resulting in a reduction in the costs associated with tax collection, compliance, and administration for the tax imposing jurisdiction. Sellers can rely on the-Network System to audit and verify their tax calculations, and transfer taxes collected by the merchant seller automatically to the Clearinghouse, thus eliminating a substantial administrative and compliance burden on the part of the seller. It is conceivable that to the extent transactions are processed through the Network System, merchant sellers could virtually eliminate the need to prepare individual tax returns to the extent that transactions that would normally be compiled and summarized to prepare the tax returns are already reported through the Network System. Additionally, the Network System alleviates tax imposing jurisdictions of the substantial burden associated with auditing and verifying taxes, and instead, enables the tax imposing jurisdictions to focus their scarce resources and attention toward other processes, including analyzing the way in which buyers and sellers are applying tax laws to the transactions they are reporting though the Network System. The tax imposing jurisdictions are free to maintain their own tax rates and laws, and do not have to adopt any common or simplified approach to tax calculations, although they would certainly be free to do so and still employ the Network System. Because the Network System may be designed around Open Standards, each tax imposing jurisdiction may have the freedom and flexibility to access data directly or indirectly through an API so that the Network System might be connected to existing legacy systems of the tax imposing jurisdictions, or to new systems, with the assistance of employees of the tax imposing jurisdictions or with the assistance of approved government service providers, or other service providers, as the case may be. From the operational viewpoint of the tax imposing jurisdictions, the Network System and associated Clearinghouse provides them the flexibility to apply their own laws and business rules to the processing and analysis of transactions they are a party to, rather than being forced to adopt a single way of doing business. The invention provides methods, systems, and computer program product to assist tax imposing jurisdictions in accessing and aggregating data from Electronic Payment Networks and/or Electronic Networks. The present invention provides methods, systems, and computer program product to assist tax imposing jurisdictions in auditing and verifying transactions and their associated tax liabilities, as well as further coding a transaction in an Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network to certify that the transaction has been audited and verified, along with making the transaction data fields, audited transaction data fields, and transaction data packets available to tax imposing jurisdictions through a Transaction Data Warehouse repository. The present invention provides methods, systems, and computer program product to enable the creation of a Clearinghouse along with the associated functionality necessary for the self-directed operation of the Clearinghouse by parties, including-but not limited to, tax imposing jurisdictions, to perform Clearinghouse functions associated with the Clearinghouse. The present invention provides methods, systems, and computer program products, and network available to determine whether the underlying tax calculation has been performed through a tax calculation software program that, in itself, has been certified, and perhaps exempt the transaction from the audit and verify certification, while still accumulating data for the transaction data fields that comprise audited transaction data fields. The present invention provides methods, systems, and computer program products to provide for collection, aggregation, routing, co-mingling, allocating or crediting, and distribution of tax monies to the financial accounts of tax imposing jurisdictions primarily on a self-directed basis. The present invention provides methods, systems, and computer program products for enabling a tax imposing jurisdiction to refund or return taxes to a tax payer via an Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network as a result of the return or refund of a goods or services where the tax on the original transaction was audited and verified by the methods of the present invention. The present invention provides effective methods, systems, and computer program products to charge a tax to the buyer of goods or services when there is no responsibility for the seller of such goods and services to collect taxes as agent for the tax imposing jurisdiction. The present invention provides methods, systems, and computer program products to aggregate audited and verified tax data in the form of audited transaction data fields based upon transaction data fields that have been accumulated from Electronic Networks and Electronic Payment Network sources. The present invention provides methods, systems, and computer program products to furnish tax imposing jurisdictions with an Open Standards development platform enabling each tax imposing jurisdiction to develop its own interface to the Transaction Data Warehouse and associated Clearinghouse features and functionality to apply its own business rules and logic. The present invention provides methods, systems, and computer program products to provide tax imposing jurisdictions with a framework to self direct a system, shared by many tax imposing jurisdictions, and apply tax laws and associated business rules associated with a specific tax imposing jurisdiction. The present invention provides methods, systems, and computer program products to intercept the data stream of an Electronic Network and/or Electronic Payment Network, or access an underlying database containing transaction data, where the underlying system of paying participating sellers for goods and services sold through an Electronic Network and/or Electronic Payment Network employs an authorization and capture process or an authorization and delayed capture process for the purpose of extending credit to a buyer for payment to the seller. The present invention provides methods, systems, and computer program products to intercept the data stream of an Electronic Network and/or Electronic Payment Network, or access an underlying database containing transaction data, where the underlying system of paying participating sellers for goods and services sold through an Electronic Network and/or Electronic Payment Network does not employ an authorization and capture process or an authorization and delayed capture process, but instead relies on other means for payment or settlement including, but not limited to, the receipt of payment from a buyer. The present invention provides a process of separately identifying data collected by tax agents through an Electronic Payment Network or Electronic Network for analytical and data processing purposes, including but not limited to, the aggregation of data relating to tax liabilities assessed by tax agents for further analysis. The present invention provides a process of assigning an identification number to a transaction for purposes of identifying analyzing, and/or auditing and verifying, and/or aggregating, tax data fields and/or tax liabilities or funds associated with such tax liabilities, arising from transactions. The present invention provides a process of conducting statistical, algorithmic, or other sampling techniques on transaction data fields to the extent such calculations are performed by a program or software application or service that has been tested and certified as accurate. The present invention provides a process of segregating tax amounts or tax liabilities from total payments received in settlement of amounts due from customers for the individual (uncoupled) purposes of analysis, data processing, and transfer of funds to tax imposing jurisdictions and/or their financial institutions, where such transfer of funds to such tax imposing jurisdictions or their financial institution is tied primarily to the receipt of funds by the tax agent, either through receipt of funds from the buyer, or authorization by the EN or EPN, rather than to passage of a certain amount of time or existing tax law. The present invention provides a process of operating a Clearinghouse with respect to data. The present invention provides a process of operating a Clearinghouse with respect to the collection and management of funds due, funds collected, funds paid, and funds payable to tax imposing jurisdictions as well as to tax agents and tax payers. The present invention provides a process of collecting transaction data fields relating to individual transactions and making such data available to tax imposing jurisdictions. The present invention provides a process of separately identifying funds relating to tax liabilities collected by tax agents through an Electronic Payment Network or Electronic Network. The present invention provides a process of maintaining co-mingled accounts and related funds on behalf of buyers, sellers, and tax imposing jurisdiction, for purposes of settling amounts relating to tax liabilities, or refunds of such liabilities, between tax imposing jurisdictions, buyers, sellers, and providers of payment or credits, such as a credit card company, and tax agents. The system of the present invention comprises a network, such as a worldwide network or a regional network, for transferring transaction data fields relating to transactions, as well as associated taxes, tax liabilities, and/or funds relating to such taxes and/or tax liabilities, from Electronic Payment Networks or Electronic Networks and/or financial institutions related to such Electronic Payment Networks or Electronic Networks, to tax imposing jurisdictions and/or financial institutions related to such tax imposing jurisdictions. The present invention performs various processing functions on such transaction data fields, including but not limited to, assigning a tax transaction identification to the transaction, auditing and verifying transactions and associated transaction data fields to determine if tax liabilities exist, as well as providing data to the Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network that the transaction associated with the transaction data fields has completed the audit and verify process. Such processes can be performed on individual transactions, groups of transactions, and transmitted individually, in groups, in a batch process, or in any other processing scheme. The Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network is then in a position, based upon further processing performed by the present invention, to transfer, or enable the transfer of, data and/or funds related to taxes that have either been made available for the payment of taxes, either through the authorization of payment process that occurs with certain Electronic Payment Networks (e.g., credit card companies), or through the payment of amounts due to the seller of goods or services, such as a payment made for the purchase of shares of common stock where the transaction and associated tax information is generally recorded through an Electronic Network such as a stock exchange, directly to tax imposing jurisdictions associated with a transaction. Aspects of the present invention may provide for data and system security both from a data encryption standpoint as well as from a permissions standpoint in the handling of data, including transmission via all links to various parts or subsystems of the present invention, while such system security, data encryption, and permission features are not required for the successful operation of the present invention. Aspects of the present invention may be designed to incorporate appropriate fault tolerance or failover technologies, although not required for the operation of the present invention. Software applications, computers, servers, operating systems, or other devices included in the network may have the capabilities of distributed computing designed into the system architecture, although such capabilities are not required for the operation of the present invention. To the extent data links have been described as connecting software applications, servers, computers, databases, peripheral devices, Electronic Networks, Electronic Payment Networks, Tax imposing jurisdictions, or their associated financial institutions once, the data links are assumed to continue operating in the same way for all data communicated between such software applications, computers, servers, devices, Electronic Networks, Electronic Payment Networks, tax imposing jurisdictions, or their associated financial institutions. The present invention is designed to process data that is being created or processed on a real time basis arising from a data stream of an Electronic Network or an Electronic Payment Network, and, as such, the present invention is, by its very architecture and design, a real time system. While the present invention operates on a real time basis, real time operation is not required for the present invention since the system is also capable of delivering data from such real time operation in a delayed or batch processing mode, based upon the preferences of the various parties involved in the operation of the present invention individually or collectively. FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a high level design and system configuration of a Network System, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As shown on FIG. 1, the system of the present invention includes an Intercept Processor 101 connected via data link L101 to an Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network Authorization Processor 102 (“Authorization Processor”), where an action is being taken to authorize a transaction for payment (i.e., financing by a financing network) based upon rules applied by the operator of the financing network, Examples of financing entities include the Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network. An example of an Electronic Payment Network is a credit card company authorizing a charge to the credit card of a buyer, who is a customer of the credit card company, in settlement of a Transaction. In some cases, the Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network may not authorize the payment of amounts in settlement of a transaction and instead relies on the purchaser to make a payment or similar action to cause funds or amounts to be credited to their account on such Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network. In such cases, the Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network Tax Liability Processor 103 (“Tax Liability Processor”) will connect with an Intercept Processor 101 via data link L102. If Intercept Processor 101 were co-located with Authorization Processor 102 the data link L101 might be made through a number of connectivity technologies including, but not limited to, Local Bus, PCMCIA Bus, USB, EIA-232, ISDN, VMEbus, firewire, fiber channels, a LAN, wireless links such as a cellular network, fiber cables, and other successor technologies that advance the capabilities of such connectivity technologies. Hereinafter, the collection of technologies that might be used to accomplish this connection shall be referred to as “local connectivity technologies”In the event that Intercept Processor 101 is in a location which is remote from the Authorization Processor 102, the data link L101 might be made through a number of remote connectivity technologies including but not limited to a PSTN, a dedicated or leased high speed digital land line with T-1 to T-3 bandwidth, ISDN links, WAN, a cable network, DSL, a virtual private network (“VPN”), wireless links such as a cellular network, a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) link, a LEO or GEO satellite link, etc., and other successor technologies that advance the capabilities of such connectivity technologies. Hereinafter, the collection of technologies that might be used to accomplish this remote connection shall be referred to as “remote connectivity technologies”. As an option, the software applications of Intercept Processor 101 may reside physically on Authorization Processor 102. If Intercept Processor 101 were co-located with Tax Liability Processor 103 the data link L102 might be made through local connectivity technologies and/or remote connectivity technologies. As an option, the software applications of Intercept Processor 101 may reside physically on Tax Liability Processor 103. While not required for the operation of the present invention, Intercept Processor 101 may be connected to other Authorization Processors 102 or other Tax Liability Processors 103 via data link L103 for the reasons including, but not limited to, the harnessing the unused processing cycles of other Intercept Processors 101 as well as other design and processing considerations, including, but not limited to, fault tolerance, failover, redundancy, latency, load balance, as well as potential system failure issues. Additionally and while not required for the operation of the present invention, Intercept Processor 101 may be connected to other Intercept Processors 101 via data link L104 for the same or similar reasons. Data link L103 and or L104 may be made through local connectivity technologies and/or remote connectivity technologies. The data links L101, L102 and L103 can transmit transaction data fields associated with transactions to Intercept Processor 101. The software applications that invoke the transmission of data from the Electronic Network or the Electronic Payment Network are integral parts of Intercept Processor 101 as well as Tax Liability Processor 103. The software applications to invoke the transmission of data between Intercept Processor 101 and Authorization Processor 102 may reside on Intercept Processor 101 and alternatively can be accomplished with a similar or companion software application installed on Authorization Processor 102 or through other software applications or methods for accessing such data, including, but not limited to, developing specific programs to accomplish such tasks, or by employing the Application Program Interface 108 or Other Program Communication Methods 109. Intercept Processor 101 transmits data associated with transactions and transaction data fields to Rules Processor 104. Intercept Processor 101 may retain Transaction data fields in volatile memory (e.g., RAM) and/or may write to non-volatile memory (e.g., a hard drive, optical disc, etc) until such data can be transmitted to the Rules Processor 104 via data link L105, L106 or L107. Data link L105, L106 and L107 may employ local connectivity technologies and/or remote connectivity technologies. While not required for the operation of the present invention, Rules Processor 104 may transmit data to other Rules Processor 104 via data link L108 for reasons including, but not limited to, the harnessing the unused processing cycles of other Rules Processor 104 as well as other design and processing considerations, including, but not limited to, fault tolerance, failover, redundancy, latency, load balance, as well as potential system failure considerations. The software applications of Rules Processor 104 may reside on Rules Processor 104 or alternatively on Intercept Processor 101. Rules Processor 104 includes programs and applications containing business rules required to conduct audit and verify functions, including calculating and verifying rates of tax as well as business rules required for the application of such rates of tax to transaction data to determine if the type of tax, as well as the rates of tax, are appropriate for the specific transaction, based upon the transaction data fields obtained from the Electronic Payment Network, or Electronic Network. While not required for the operation of the present invention, Rules Processor 104 may maintain such rates of tax and associated business rules to conduct its audit and verify processes in volatile memory (e.g., RAM) and/or non-volatile memory such as, but not limited to, a hard drive or optical disc. Alternatively, such rates of tax and associated business rules could be accessed by methods that include, but not limited to, Rules Processor 104 communicating with a third party application containing such rates of tax and associated business rules, or via a web services library or an associated Application Program Interface published by a third party application provider. Rules Processor 104 employs tax and business rules to audit and verify transaction data fields. Rules Processor 104 creates, as one of its processes, transaction data packets, which are then transferred to the Aggregation Server 105 or other Aggregation Servers 105 via data link L109, L110, or L111. Data link L109, L110, or L111 may employ local communication technologies or remote communication technologies depending on the amount of data being processed by Aggregation Server 105 or other Aggregation Servers 105. While not required for the operation of the present invention, Aggregation Server 105 may transmit data to other Aggregation Servers 105 via data link L112 for reasons including, but not limited to, the harnessing the unused processing cycles of other Aggregation Servers 105 as well as other design and processing considerations, including, but not limited to, fault tolerance, failover, redundancy, latency, load balance, as well as potential system failure considerations. To the extent that the functions of Rules Processor 104 are performed by a GST or other service provider, the system employs business rules such as, but not limited to, a statistical or other algorithmically derived sampling methods to determine which transactions, if any, are subject to the audit and verify processes. In such a case, Rules Processor 104 creates a transaction sampling scheme to determine which transactions will be subject to the audit and verify process. The audit and verify resulting from execution of Rules Processor 104 are transferred to the Aggregation Server 105 or other Aggregation Servers 105 via data link L109, L110, or L111. Data link L109, L110, or L1 may employ local communication technologies or remote communication technologies depending on the amount of data being processed by Aggregation Server 105 or other Aggregation Servers 105. While not required for the operation of the present invention, Aggregation Server 105 may transmit data to other Aggregation Servers 105 via data link L112 for reasons including, but not limited to, the harnessing the unused processing cycles of other Aggregation Servers 105 as well as other design and processing considerations, including, but not limited to, fault tolerance, failover, redundancy, latency, load balance, as well as potential system failure considerations. Aggregation Server 105 comprises software applications to manage the process of collecting, aggregating, and transferring, separately, collectively, or in any combination, and is not limited to, transaction data fields, audited transaction data fields, transaction data packets, tax liability information, tax information, information arising from the combination or analysis of any data from such sources, as well as associated information relating to funds collected and/or managed, or amounts funds due, funds payable, or funds receivable that arise from their association with or analysis or combination with such information. Such information is referred to as “Data”, and is transferred and stored to a Transaction Data Warehouse (Database) 106. Database 106 is designed for the purpose of storing such Data as well as making such Data available for further processing and analysis. Database 106 is connected to Aggregation Server 105 via data link L113 and L114. Data links L113 and L114 may employ local connectivity technologies and/or remote connectivity technologies. The Database 106 is connected to the Financial/Treasury/Data Services Clearinghouse 107 (“Clearinghouse”) via data link L115. While not indicated in FIG. 1, and not required for operation of the present invention, Clearinghouse 107 may be transfer Data to other Clearinghouses 107 for reasons including, but not limited to, the harnessing the unused processing cycles of other Clearinghouses 107 as well as other design and processing considerations, including, but not limited to, fault tolerance, failover, redundancy, latency, load balance, as well as potential system failure considerations. The Database 106 and the Clearinghouse 107 are accessed by the Application Program Interface 108 or Other Program Communication Methods 109 via data links L116 and L117, respectively, and may employ local connectivity technologies and/or remote connectivity technologies. The software programs and/or applications will access Database 106 and Clearinghouse 107 by including references to, or invoking, certain programs, applications, or objects, or the object program layer and/or other features and capabilities accessed via Application Program Interface 108. In addition to, or as an alternative to accessing Database 106 and Clearinghouse 107, Other Program Communication Methods 109 can be used to access information stored in Database 106 and Clearinghouse 107. These methods include, but are not limited to, software program(s) or application(s) developed that do not require access to Application Program Interface 108 and instead access Database 106 and Clearinghouse 107 directly, processes that communicate certain data via verbal instructions over a telephone to an operator of the present invention, or processes that employ fax machines to communicate written instructions to the operator of the present invention. To the extent Other Program Communication Methods 109 is employed, data links L116 and L117 will be modified, augmented, or extended accordingly. While not required for the operation of the present invention, Network Controller 110 can be employed to monitor the systems, subsystems, and processes occurring on all, or any of, Authorization Processor 102 via data link L118, Tax Liability Processor 103 via data link L119, Intercept Processor 101 via data link L120, Rules Processor 104 via data link L121, Aggregation Server 105 via data link L122, Database 106 via data link L123, Clearinghouse 107 via data link L124, as well as the Application Program Interface 108 via data link L125. The Network Controller 110 enables operators of the Network System to perform operations that include, but are not limited to, monitoring the operation of, and identify problems that might exist within, various aspects of the Network System. Data links L118, L119, L120, L121, L122, L123, L124, and L125 may employ local connectivity technologies and/or remote connectivity technologies depending on the amount of Data being processed by Network Controller 101 as well as other design and processing considerations, including, but not limited to, fault tolerance, failover, redundancy, latency, load balance, as well as potential system failure. While not required for the operation of the present invention, Network Controller 110 may be connected to another Network Controller 110 via data link L126 and may employ local connectivity technologies and/or remote connectivity technologies and may transfer Data to other Network Controllers 110 for reasons including, but not limited to, the harnessing the unused processing cycles of other Network Controllers 110 as well as other design and processing considerations, including, but not limited to, fault tolerance, failover, redundancy, latency, load balance, as well as potential system failure. To the extent that tax calculations are being performed by a government service provider or other provider, as the case may be, data links L118, L119, L120, and L121 may not be required for operation of the system. The principals set forth in FIG. 1 related to distributed computing are not repeated at every aspect, embodiment, or step in the description herein of present invention, but nonetheless may be employed throughout the Network System as applicable. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a high level design and configuration of the Network System of FIG. 1 viewed from a functionality standpoint, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a different view of the system of the present invention as shown in FIG. 1 and is arranged to display the present invention from the perspective of potential users of the present invention, with no references to multiple data link paths or other features required for distributed computing, as well as no references to Network Controller 110 (see FIG. 1) or the data links required to employ Network Controller 110 (see FIG. 1). In FIG. 1, Other Program Communication Methods 109 is shown as being directly connected to the clearinghouse 107 via data link L117, directly connected to the network controller 110 via data link L125, and indirectly connected to the electronic network or electronic networks 102 and 103 via data links L118 and L119, respectively, by making use of the aforementioned connection to the network controller 110. In FIG. 2, Other Program Communication Methods 109 is shown with additional connections L201, L17, and L202 as shown. Groups connected to the present invention include the Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network 201 that employs Other Program Communication Methods 109 (see FIG. 1) such as modifying an existing software program, or developing a unique software program, to establish a programmatic path L201 to accomplish the process of enabling the routing of transaction data fields to the Intercept Processor 101 (see FIG. 1) via data link L101 (see FIG. 1), enabling Intercept Data Processor 101 (see FIG. 1) to conduct its processes, transferring some or all the results of such processes to Rules Processor 104 (see FIG. 1) via data link L105 (see FIG. 1), further enabling Rules Processor 104 (see FIG. 1) to perform its processes, transferring some or all of the results of such processes to Aggregation Server 105 (see FIG. 1) via data link L109 (see FIG. 1), further enabling Aggregation Server 105 (see FIG. 1) to perform its processes, transferring some or all of the results of such processes to Database 106 (see FIG. 1) via data link L113 (see FIG. 1). Database 106 is the repository for all data and is available for processes and/or functions performed by Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1) with respect to Data and/or processes relating to funds associated with such Data. Database 106 (see FIG. 1) and/or Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1) are accessed via the Application Program Interface 108 and/or Other Program Communication Methods 109 via Data links L116 (see FIG. 1). L117 (see FIG. 1), L16 (see FIG. 2), and L17 (see FIG. 2). Multiple parties may link to (via data link L202) and employ the Application Program Interface 108 (see FIG. 1) and/or Other Program Communication Methods 109 (see FIG. 1) to establish an ability to access Database 106 (see FIG. 1) or Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1). Examples of such parties include, but are not limited to, a tax imposing jurisdiction 202 employing Application Program Interface 108 (see FIG. 1) to modify an existing legacy application, a financial institution associated with a tax imposing jurisdiction, hereinafter referred to as a “TIJ Financial Institution” 203 employing Other Program Communication Methods 109 (see FIG. 1) such as a specially created software program designed for performing certain financial or treasury Clearinghouse functions relating to Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1) while also employing Application Program Interface 108 (see FIG. 1) to accomplish other tasks. Certain software products or software service applications 204 might be created for the purpose and offered for the use of tax imposing jurisdictions or other parties associated to such TIJs, such as a government service provider, to either purchase or license for a one time fee, or an ongoing rental or licensing fee. A TIJ Financial Institution might create, or have access to, Custom Applications 205 or services rendered through the use of a combination of employing the Application Program Interface 108 (see FIG. 1) to accomplish certain functions, as well as employing Other Program Communication Methods 109 (see FIG. 1) such as faxing, when policies of the financial institution require a hard copy or facsimile of funds transfer instructions before the instructions relating to such transfer can be performed. A further example of such parties is an Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network 201 that employs a Custom or Product/Service Application 206 designed to invoke the capabilities of Application Program Interface 108 (see FIG. 1) to accomplish tasks in addition to those that may be accomplished connecting Intercept Processor 101 (see FIG. 1) to such Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network 201 via Other Program Communication Methods 109 (see FIG. 1). FIG. 3 is a flowchart depicting a processing of tax aspects of a sale of goods and/or services from a seller to a buyer in conjunction with the Network System of FIGS. 1 and 2, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. FIG. 3 depicts an implementation of the present invention dealing with an Electronic Payment Network (“EPN”) such as a credit card processing network, and the ways by which the present invention accesses transaction data fields associated with transactions which are then processed by Intercept Processor 101 (see FIG. 1). The process may be performed by the Network, or a GST, or other service provider. One of the first steps taken by the credit card processing network is credit card authorization, or authorization, defined as the process of verifying that the credit, debit, corporate, or other Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network card (or account associated with such card) has sufficient funds or credit available to cover the amount of the transaction. An authorization transaction generally does not transfer funds. Rather, the authorization process places a hold on the cardholder's open-to-buy limit, lowering the cardholder's limit by the amount of the amount authorized. This authorization is a “first step” of an authorization and delayed capture transaction, wherein the “second step” of the authorization and delayed capture transaction, namely the capture, occurs at a later point in time when the goods and/or services have been shipped (for goods) or provided (for services) to the buyer. For purposes of the implementation presented in FIG. 3, it is assumed that the credit card transaction being conducted is an authorized transaction. A collection of transaction data associated with one or more transactions is passing through an Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network. This is referred to, or defined, as a “data stream/database” 301. Data stream/database 301, in this example case, is arising through the aggregation of transaction data from many different merchant sellers via many different communication methods and protocols. Data stream/database 301 permits employment of either a data stream or a database alternative. If the data stream alternative of the data stream/database 301 is employed, then step 302 recognizes in transactions and associated transaction data fields in the data stream 301 through a software program or application designed to read or interpret data while in the data stream (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1). The software program or application may read or interpret original data, metadata associated with original data, or a copy of the original data, depending on the particular implementation of the present invention with a particular Electronic Payment Network, or Electronic Network. If the database alternative of the data stream/database 301 is employed, then step 302 obtains data can by accessing a database containing such data, preferably after the authorization process has been completed, although such database could also be accessed prior to the beginning of the authorization process (performed by Authorization Processor 102—see FIG. 1). In step 334, a determination is made as to whether the transaction has successfully completed the authorization process (performed by Authorization Processor 102—see FIG. 1) and received authorization for payment by the credit card company. If the answer in step 334 is “No”, then processing of the transaction and associated transaction data fields terminates in step 333. If the answer in step 334 is “Yes”, two processes next occur with one of the two processes beginning in step 303 and the other of the two processes beginning in step 304, respectively. In step 303, a copy is created (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1) of the transaction data fields associated with the authorized transaction from reading original data, metadata, or a copy of the original data, depending on the specific implementation of the present invention with the Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network. In step 304, a unique tax transaction identification (“ID”) (e.g., a number) is assigned (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1). An alternative implementation is to accept a transaction number already assigned by the credit card company or other credit card authorization service provider to the transaction as the unique tax transaction ID of step 304 (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1). In step 305, the unique tax transaction ID of step 304 is appended to transaction data fields associated with the data stream/database 306 (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1). While not required for the operation of the present Invention, the process of appending may be accomplished by transmitting the tax unique transaction ID 304 (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1) to the credit card company where such data may be either written to a database maintained by the credit card company, or the data could reenter the data stream for association or appending (step 305) while other processes unrelated to the present invention are occurring. To the extent that the unique tax transaction ID in step 304 references a tax transaction number assigned by a credit card company or other credit card authorization service provider, there is no need to append a unique transaction ID to data or a database maintained by a credit card company or Credit Card Authorization service provider. This determination is made in step 305 by Intercept Processor 101 (see FIG. 1). The unique tax transaction ID may be maintained in a database owned by, or for the benefit of, the merchant seller. The result of this is that a transaction that has completed the authorization process 334 has a unique tax transaction ID 304 assigned, but the transaction has not yet been through the steps required for capture and the transaction has not yet completed the audit and verify process of step 308. Step 307 (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1) appends the unique tax transaction ID of step 304 to the copy of transaction data field information previously generated in step 303 (i.e., step 307 is performed after steps 303 and 304 are performed). The transaction data fields are next analyzed by the audit and verify process in step 308 (performed by Rules Processor 104—see FIG. 1) to determine, inter alia, if the tax liability provided in the transaction data fields with respect to the associated transaction is accurate, or within a range deemed acceptable by the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions, based upon their applicable tax laws. Examples of outcomes that may occur in the audit and verify process of step 308 include, but are not limited to: 

 (1) a determination that a re-calculated tax liability (within the audit and verify step 308) is acceptable based upon the tax laws of the tax imposing jurisdiction applied to the transaction data fields associated with the transaction;  (2) a determination based on transaction data fields associated with the transaction that no tax liability exists;  (3) a determination based on transaction data fields associated with the transaction that the seller's use tax or the buyer's use tax is applicable to the transaction but no such taxes were identified for payment since the merchant seller did not have a nexus with the buyer; and  (4) a determination based on transaction data fields associated with the transaction that the original tax calculation, as provided in the transaction data fields from the original data stream is mathematically inaccurate. 

An alternative embodiment of the present invention includes examining the transaction data fields associated with a transaction (performed by Rules Processor 104—see FIG. 1) to determine if data exists relating to the tax calculation software application employed by the merchant seller to perform tax calculations. To the extent the software application that has been certified by an independent party recognized by the applicable tax imposing jurisdiction for producing accurate and reliable tax calculations for the specific type of tax calculation being calculated, the software is deemed a “Certified Tax Calculation Application” and different processes may be applied to transaction data fields associated with tax calculations where such calculations have been performed by a Certified tax Calculation Application. Examples of said different processes include, but are not limited to: 

 (1) accepting such calculations with no separate audit and verify process, while still creating audited transaction data field information in step 309; and  (2) employing a statistical or sampling algorithm to select transactions and associated transaction data fields for auditing and verifying calculation in step 308 (performed by Rules Processor 104—see FIG. 1) where such tax calculations were performed by a Certified tax Calculation Application, while still creating audited transaction data field information in step 309. 

After the audit and verify process of step 308 (performed by Rules Processor 104—see FIG. 1) has been completed with respect to transaction data fields associated with the transaction, audited transaction data fields are created in step 309 (performed by Rules Processor 104—see FIG. 1). The audited transaction data fields comprise the data contained in the transaction data fields as well as such data to indicate the audit and verify process has been completed, including the types of tax or taxes the transaction data fields were tested for, the results of such tests, variances, if any between the tax liability as provided in the transaction data fields, and tax liabilities, as re-calculated in the audit and verify process. The audited transaction data field information created in 309 are appended to, or merged into: (1) the transaction data fields maintained by the credit card company and/or merchant seller (in step 310); and (2) the transaction data fields maintained within the present invention (in step 312). Steps 310 and 312 are performed by Rules Processor 104 (see FIG. 1). In step 314 (performed by Aggregation Server 105—see FIG. 1), the audited tax transaction data fields and any associated Data are transferred to the Database 106 (see FIG. 1) and this portion of the process ends in step 316. While not required for operation of the present Invention, the credit card company and/or merchant appends or merges audited transaction data fields in step 310 to the associated with the data stream/database 311. For an embodiment in which the merchant seller is a legal agent for the collection of tax from the buyer and also for payment of such tax to the appropriate tax imposing jurisdiction(s), step 313 (a “credit” step) makes entries (i.e., “credits”) in the accounts of the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions, thus increasing the balance of the account of the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions by the amount of the tax liability in the audited transaction data fields. A corresponding “counter entry” (i.e., “debit”) is made to the account of the merchant seller in step 315 (a “debit” step) (performed by Aggregation Server 105—see FIG. 1), thus decreasing the balance of the account by the amount of the tax liability that will be transferred to the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions. After step 315, the process ends in step 317. An alternative implementation to eliminate step 305 and reduce step 310 is to retain the copy of the transaction data field information generated in step 303 (for subsequent use in step 310) until a unique tax transaction ID is assigned in step 304 and the audit and verify process step 308 has been completed. The results of step 308 is then combined into the audited transaction data field information of step 309 and is next appended or merged by the credit card company and/or merchant in step 310 (performed by Intercept Processor 101 and/or Aggregation Server 105—see FIG. 1). Since the copy of the transaction data field information of step 303 has been updated to provide for appending the unique tax transaction ID of step 304 and completing the audit and verify process of step 308, the append step 312 is no longer necessary and the audited transaction data Fields are transferred in step 314 to Database 106 (see FIG. 1), and this portion of the process ends in step 316. In an alternative embodiment relating to FIG. 3 in which the buyer finances the transaction through a charge to the buyer's credit card, there is no legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction, and the merchant seller has no legal obligation to report the transaction to a tax imposing jurisdiction that is legally permitted to collect a tax on the transaction. As an example, the transaction may occur over the Internet such that the buyer is legally obligated to pay a use tax to a tax imposing jurisdiction, but the merchant seller is not required to report the transaction to the tax imposing jurisdiction. The process of FIG. 3 applies to this alternative embodiment, with the exception that the credit and debit steps 313 and 315, respectively, are not performed. Nonetheless, all of the transaction data fields have been recorded in the Database 106 in step 314. Since the tax imposing jurisdictions may periodically query the Database 106 via any of the software mechanisms 202, 203, 204, and/or 205 of FIG. 2 as described supra, this alternative embodiment of the present invention offers tax imposing jurisdictions practical mechanisms for tax collection for situations in which no practical tax collection mechanism existed previously in the related art. In an alternative embodiment relating to FIG. 3 in which the buyer finances the transaction through a charge to the buyer's credit card, the credit card company (or other EPN or EN) is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. The process of FIG. 3 applies to this alternative embodiment, with the exception that the debit step 315 is modified as follows. In step 315, the corresponding “counter entry” (i.e., “debit”) is made to the account of the credit card company instead of to the merchant seller, since in this embodiment the credit card company, rather than the merchant seller, is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. In an alternative embodiment relating to FIG. 3 in which the buyer finances the transaction through a charge to the buyer's credit card, the Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1) is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. At the time when authorization for the transaction between the buyer and merchant seller occurs, the financing network (e.g., the credit card company) credits the account of the Clearinghouse 107 for the amount of tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. Otherwise, the process of FIG. 3 applies to this alternative embodiment, with the exception that the debit step 315 is modified as follows. In step 315, the corresponding “counter entry” (i.e., “debit”) is made to the account of the Clearinghouse 107 instead of to the merchant seller, since in this embodiment the Clearinghouse 107, rather than the merchant seller, is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. In an alternative embodiment relating to FIG. 3 in which the buyer finances the transaction through a charge to the buyer's credit card, there is no legal agent to the transaction for the collection of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction, and the tax imposing jurisdiction is legally entitled to receive the tax from the financing network (e.g., the credit card company) when authorization for payment of the transaction by the financing network occurs, at which time the credit financing network pays the amount of tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. Otherwise, the process of FIG. 3 applies to this alternative embodiment, with the exception that the credit and debit steps 313 and 315, respectively, are not performed. In summary in relation to the process of FIG. 3 in which the buyer finances the transaction through a charge to the buyer's credit card, the present invention provides the aforementioned five embodiments revolving around agency relationships and the performance or non-performance of associated credit and debit steps 313 and 315, respectively. In the first such embodiment, the seller is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. In the second such embodiment, there is no legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. In the third such embodiment, the credit card company is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. In the fourth such embodiment, the Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1) is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. In the fifth such embodiment, there is no legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction, and the tax imposing jurisdiction is legally entitled to receive the tax from the financing network (i.e., the electronic network or the electronic payment network) at the time of occurrence of the transaction. If at least two of the aforementioned five embodiments may potentially prevail in a transaction in an implementation of the present invention, then the transaction data field may include an indication of which of the preceding five embodiments applies (and supporting data required for the implementation, if any) for each tax imposing jurisdiction involved in the transaction. Examples of at least two of the aforementioned five embodiments prevailing in a transaction are as follows, wherein the transaction comprises a first TIJ and a second TIJ such that the first and second TIJs are different TIJs. In a first example, there is a first legal agent to the transaction for collection and payment of the tax due to the first TIJ and there is no legal agent to the transaction for collection and payment of the tax due to the second TIJ. In a first special case of the first example, the first legal agent is the seller, the financing network, or the Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1). In a second special case of the first example, the second TIJ is legally entitled to receive its tax due at the time of occurrence of said authorization. In a second example, there is a first legal agent to the transaction for collection and payment of the tax due to the first TIJ and there is a second agent to the transaction for collection and payment of the tax due to the second TIJ, wherein the first and second agents are different agents each selected from the group consisting of the seller, the financing network, and the Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1). Since the buyer engages in only a single credit card transaction regardless of which of the aforementioned five embodiments applies, the implementation details pertaining to the relevant embodiments of the aforementioned five embodiments is essentially or substantially transparent to the buyer, which is a major convenience for the buyer. The following example illustrates the aforementioned five embodiments of FIG. 3. This example illustrates a transaction in which a buyer, who could also be referred to as the taxpayer, is making a purchase from a merchant seller for $100.00 and decides to settle the transaction by paying with a credit card. In the first embodiment of the aforementioned five embodiments for this example, the merchant seller operates an Internet web site and is located in a same tax imposing jurisdiction as the taxpayer buyer. The seller has “nexus”, which is the condition of the merchant seller having sufficient presence in a tax imposing jurisdiction relating to the buyer, to be subject to specific laws of that tax imposing jurisdiction with respect to the collection of tax as a tax agent on behalf of such tax imposing jurisdiction. The merchant seller collects information from the taxpayer buyer including all transaction data fields necessary for the calculation of sales tax, which, in this case, amounts to a total of $8.00 based upon a tax rate of 8%, a rate which combines a 4% rate of tax assessed by the county the buyer is located in, and an additional 4% rate assessed by the state the buyer is located in. The merchant seller completes the calculation of tax via a computer program located on the seller's computer or point of sale device, calculates a total amount due from the buyer ($108.00), comprised of the original amount of the purchase plus associated sales tax, and forwards the details of the transaction and associated transaction data fields to the buyer's credit card company. The merchant seller accepts the buyer's credit card through a “Card Not Present Merchant Account,” which is a merchant account required to be maintained by the buyer, who is also referred to as the “merchant”, when doing business over the Internet. The credit card company receives the information related to the transaction, including the associated transaction data fields, and begins the authorization process with respect to the buyer's credit card. In step 302, the present invention recognizes transaction data fields from the data stream/database 301 of the credit card company, and concludes (in step 334) that the transaction has already been authorized. Thus a copy of the transaction data fields are made in step 303, a unique tax transaction ID is assigned in step 304, and appended to the copy 303 of the transaction data fields in step 307, as well as being appended to the original transaction data fields 306 in step 305. In step 308, the transaction data fields are audited and verified and determined to be accurate. In step 309, the audited transaction data field information is created, indicating accurate tax calculations and a tax liability of $4.00 payable to one tax imposing jurisdiction, namely the county where the buyer and seller are located, as well as $4.00 payable to another tax imposing jurisdiction, namely the state where the buyer and merchant seller are located. In step 311, these audited transaction data fields are appended or merged with the data stream or database containing the original transaction data fields. In step 313, an entry is made in the account of the county to record an amount payable directly to such county for $4.00, and an entry is made in the account of the state to record an amount payable directly to such state for $4.00. In step 315, an entry is made in the account of the merchant seller, recording a total liability of $8.00. In step 312, the audited transaction data fields are appended or merged with the transaction data fields copy and transferred in step 314 to Database 106 (see FIG. 1) where such Data may be further accessed by the respective state and county tax authorities via any of mechanisms 202-205 of FIG. 2. The tax liabilities in this example will be paid to the state and local tax authorities, or made available to them in their Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1) account, as soon as the credit card capture transaction occurs. In the second embodiment of the aforementioned five embodiments for this example, if the merchant seller has no physical location or place of business in the state of the buyer, the seller may not have nexus, and therefore is not responsible (under existing tax law) for the collection of tax from the buyer with respect to the tax imposing jurisdiction of the buyer. Assuming all other facts associated with the transaction remaining the same, the merchant seller calculates the total amount to be charged to the credit card ($100.00). When the transaction data fields are audited and verified in step 308 (performed by Rules Server 104—see FIG. 1) a determination is made (by Aggregation Server 105—see FIG. 1) that while the merchant seller is not responsible for the collection of taxes based upon current law, the buyer is nonetheless responsible for a use tax payable to tax imposing jurisdictions. Audited transaction data field information is created in step 309 and transferred back to the credit card company in step 310 (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1), and also in step 314 to the Database 106 (see FIG. 1) (performed by Aggregation Server 105—see FIG. 1) where it is available for further analysis and further processing by such state and county tax authorities via any of mechanisms 202-205 of FIG. 2. The tax imposing jurisdiction could charge the credit card of the buyer for $4.00 of use tax. The tax imposing jurisdiction (in this case a state tax authority) could also charge the additional $4.00 on behalf of the county if the state had an agency relationship with such county tax authority. However, since the tax has been identified as relating to such county, and the county has access to funds with the credit card company directly (via step 313) or through the Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1) functionality, the county tax authority may want to take direct responsibility for management of its own tax affairs by accessing the Database 106 (see FIG. 1) via a number of different alternatives, such as employing a software product or service application 204 (see FIG. 2). The tax imposing jurisdiction could also access the Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1) through a Custom or Product/Service Application 205 (see FIG. 2). By accessing the Database 106 (see FIG. 1) and/or the Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1) in this way, the state tax authority could choose from a variety of different processing options, including, but not limited to, sending a notice to the buyer, or request the credit card company to include such notice in its next credit card account statement mailed to the buyer, accumulating such use tax liabilities based upon state defined business rules and notifying the taxpayer when the amounts exceed a pre-determined threshold, with amounts below that threshold amount automatically treated as a tax liability that is automatically added to the appropriate state income tax return at year end. The state tax authority might also consider automatically charging a service fee, to defray the cost of individually collecting use tax. In the third embodiment of the aforementioned five embodiments for this example, the credit card company is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. The process of FIG. 3 applies to this third embodiment as compared with the first embodiment, with the exception that the debit step 315 is modified as follows. In step 315, the corresponding “counter entry” (i.e., “debit”) of $8.00 is made to the account of the credit card company instead of to the merchant seller, since in this embodiment the credit card company, rather than the merchant seller, is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. In the fourth embodiment of the aforementioned five embodiments for this example, the Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1) is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. At the time when the transaction between the buyer and merchant seller occurs, the credit card company credits $8.00 to the account of the Clearinghouse 107 for the amount of tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. Otherwise, the process of FIG. 3 applies to this fourth embodiment as compared with the first embodiment, with the exception that the debit step 315 is modified as follows. In step 315, the corresponding “counter entry” (i.e., “debit”) of $8.00 is made to the account of the Clearinghouse 107 instead of to the merchant seller, since in this embodiment the Clearinghouse 107, rather than the merchant seller, is the legal agent to the transaction for the collection and payment of the tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction. In the fifth embodiment of the aforementioned five embodiments for this example, there is no legal agent to the transaction for the collection of the $8.00 tax due to the tax imposing jurisdiction, and the tax imposing jurisdiction is legally entitled to receive the tax $8.00 at the time of occurrence of the transaction. At the time when the transaction between the buyer and merchant seller occurs, the credit card company pays the amount of tax due ($8.00) to the tax imposing jurisdiction. Otherwise, the process of FIG. 3 applies to this alternative embodiment, with the exception that the credit and debit steps 313 and 315, respectively, are not performed. An alternative embodiment of the present invention is the processing of a credit transaction through a credit card relating to returned merchandise seeking credit, or a voided transaction. In such a case the steps outlined in FIG. 3 are all performed, with the exception that all dollar amounts are computed as credits, or negative amounts. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention in FIG. 3, the credit card company determines that it does not want to implement steps required to enable the present invention to connect to the credit card company's data stream/ database 301 for the purpose of assigning a transaction ID in step 304 and conducting audit and verify procedures in step 308. Instead, the credit card company determines it will simply identify tax liabilities relating to transactions, making an entry in the account of the tax imposing jurisdiction 313 and simultaneously making a corresponding counter entry 315 in the account of the merchant seller, followed by providing related transaction data fields available to parties including the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions. FIG. 4 is a flowchart depicting a processing of tax aspects of a sale of goods and/or services from a seller to a buyer in conjunction with the Network System of FIGS. 1 and 2, in accordance with alternative embodiments of the present invention. FIG. 4 relates to situations in which the Electronic Payment Network and/or Electronic Network does not rely on the credit card authorization and capture process, or a similar process to initiate the payment for goods or services rendered. In contrast with FIG. 4, the authorization and capture process of FIG. 3 is fundamentally designed to extend immediate credit to a buyer for immediate, or near immediate, payment of liabilities incurred for the purchase of goods and services. In such case of FIG. 3, the credit risk associated with the payment for goods and services has been eliminated by the seller, and, instead, replaced by a credit risk borne by the credit card company extending credit to the buyer of goods and/or services for near immediate payment to the merchant seller. Absent the authorization and capture process, Electronic Payment Networks and Electronic Networks generally bear the credit risk associated with the sale of goods and services, requiring a different implementation of the present invention. The credit card authorization and capture from a merchant seller's perspective, generally signals payment for goods and/or services rendered. In the embodiments of FIG. 4, the same seller makes a sale and does not collect immediate payment via cash, check, or credit card, and the seller is extending credit to the buyer through the creation of a balance due, or account receivable from the buyer. In such cases, the Intercept Processor 101 (see FIG. 1) communicates with a Tax Liability Processor 103 (see FIG. 1) to collect transaction data fields. Tax Liability Processor 103 (see FIG. 1) is designed to systematically recognize sales made, and payments are received by buyers relating to amounts outstanding from sellers accounts. When payment for the transaction has been received from the buyer, the transaction is classified as a “paid-up” transaction. First the transaction database 402 relating to sales and amounts due, accounts receivable, etc., is polled in step 401 (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1) for information relevant to executing subsequent steps 403 and 404. Step 403 determines if there is any transaction(s) associated new sales booked. If the answer in step 403 is “Yes”, then a sequence of steps 405-409 is next executed. If the answer in step 403 is “No”, then step 404 (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1) determines if there are any new data relating to the collection of amounts due on pending transactions. A “pending” transaction is a transaction that has previously been initiated, but payment by the buyer for the transaction has not yet been detected in step 404. When payment for the transaction has been detected in step 404, the transaction is classified as a “paid-up” transaction. If the answer in step 404 is “Yes”, then a sequence of steps 410-413 is next executed. If the answer in step 404 is “No”, then the process loops back to the polling step 401. Thus the process of FIG. 4 executes the sequence of steps 405-409 when new data on sales books is detected, and the sequence of steps 410-413 when new data relating to the collection of amounts due on previous transactions is detected. In alternative embodiments, the polling step 401 is not a separate step, but is instead performed within step 403 and within step 404. In the execution of steps 405-409 (new data on sales books is detected), step 405 obtains transaction data fields associated with new transactions from the transaction database 402 (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1). Step 406 assigns a unique tax transaction ID to the transaction (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1), appends the unique tax transaction ID to the transaction data fields, and also performs audit and verify on the transaction data fields in a manner that is essentially or substantially the same as the audit and verify step 308 of FIG. 3 (performed by Rules Processor 104—see FIG. 1). After step 406, such data are considered audited transaction data fields (ATDF), which are next appended or merged in step 407 (performed by Aggregation Server 105—see FIG. 1). Step 408 updates the Database 106 (performed by Aggregation Server 105—see FIG. 1) to include the audited transaction data fields. The process ends in step 409, or alternatively the process returns to the loop of steps 401, 403, and 404 (not shown) to resume the polling of the transaction database 402. In the execution of steps 410-413 (new data relating to the collection of amounts due on previous pending transactions is detected so that the transaction has become a paid-up transaction), step 410 obtains audited transaction data fields associated with the transaction from the transaction database 402 (performed by Intercept Processor 101—see FIG. 1). Step 411 makes an entry to credit the account of the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions (performed by Aggregation Server 105—see FIG. 1) to whom the tax is payable to, and the associated funds are transferred to the Clearinghouse 7 (see FIG. 1) relating to such tax liabilities (performed by Aggregation Server 105—see FIG. 1). Step 412 debits the account of the merchant seller by the amount of such tax liabilities. In step 413, Database 106 (see FIG. 1) is updated to reflect the receipt of payment, and the associated audited transaction data fields are updated accordingly. The process ends in step 414, or alternatively the process returns to the loop of steps 401, 403, and 404 (not shown) to resume the polling of the transaction database 402. The following example further illustrates embodiments of FIG. 4. This example illustrates a transaction in which a buyer, who could also be referred to as the taxpayer, is making a purchase from a merchant seller for $100.00 and decides to settle the transaction by requesting the merchant seller to extend credit, providing the buyer with 30 days to pay for his purchase. The merchant seller is located in the same jurisdiction as the buyer. The merchant seller has “nexus”, which is the condition of the seller having sufficient presence in a tax imposing jurisdiction with respect to the collection of tax as a tax agent on behalf of such tax imposing jurisdiction. The merchant seller collects information from the taxpayer buyer including all transaction data fields necessary for the calculation of sales tax, which, in this case, amounts to a total of $8.00 based upon a tax rate of 8%, a rate which combines a 4% rate of tax assessed by the county the buyer is located in, and an additional 4% rate assessed by the state the buyer is located in. The merchant seller completes the calculation of tax by submitting appropriate transaction data fields to the Electronic Network Tax Liability Processor 103 (see FIG. 1) for calculation of tax. In the present example, the Tax Liability Processor 103 is provided by a GST whose programs have been certified as accurate and therefore requiring no further recalculation. The Tax Liability Processor 103 calculates the tax liability of $8.00 which is then combined with the amount of the purchase ($100.00) to determine the total amount due from the buyer ($108.00), comprised of the original amount of the purchase plus associated sales tax, and forwards the details of the transaction and associated transaction data fields to the merchant seller's accounting department to record the sale as an account receivable. Such amount could also be entered into the transaction database 402 of the merchant seller directly through the seller's point of sale or other similar software program. For this example, the iterative looping though steps 401, 403, and 404 proceeds (with possible transient departures from this loop when new data on new sales booked is detected in step 403) until collection of the tax ($8.00) is detected in step 404, which triggers execution of the steps 410-413. Step 411 credits the amount of tax ($8.00) to the account of the tax imposing jurisdiction, step 412 debits the account of the merchant seller by the amount ($8.00) of the tax liability, and step 413 updates the Database 106 (see FIG. 1). An alternative embodiment is to credit the account of the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions in step 411 for tax liabilities based upon the tax laws of the tax imposing jurisdiction, and make a counter entry in the account of the merchant seller, (e.g., at step 403) regardless of whether funds were collected by the merchant seller. An alternative embodiment is to credit the account of the appropriate tax imposing jurisdictions in step 411 and also to transfer funds from the merchant seller to the Financial/Treasury/Data Services Clearinghouse 107 (see FIG. 1) (e.g., at step 403). This could be performed by Intercept Processor 101. (see FIG. 1) or Aggregation Server 105 (see FIG. 1). An alternative embodiment of the present invention, in application to both FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, is to skip, or override, the functions provided by Aggregation Server 105 (see FIG. 1) and enable the processes performed by the Intercept Processor 101 (see FIG. 1) and Rules Processor 104 (see FIG. 1) to poll the Database 106 (see FIG. 1) directly and merge or append updates to such data directly, possibly by accessing metadata relating to the Database 106 (see FIG. 1). As some other examples of the present invention, which examples are by no way an exhaustive list of applications, if a national sales tax was implemented, the infrastructure employed by the system of the present invention could facilitate the distribution of collected revenues to an appropriate revenue agency. Further, issues of distributing a tax collected at only one point to different entities will arise constantly. Many state sales taxes are, in fact, a bundled charge combining different tax imposing jurisdictions such as a county rate along with a state rate of tax. Also, in the formation of the European Union, a tax may only be collected at a final point of sale, but such a tax may be required to be distributed among different revenue agencies, which can encompass different countries. In this instance, the system of the present invention is specifically designed to be effective in ensuring the efficient and appropriate break out and routing of such collected tax revenues. The mechanisms and processes set forth in the present description may be implemented using a conventional and general purpose microprocessor programmed according to the teachings of the present invention, as appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art or arts. Appropriate software coding can readily be prepared by skilled programmers based on the teachings of the present disclosure, as will also be apparent by those skilled in the relevant art or arts. FIG. 5 illustrates a computer system 90 used for implementing any software functionality described herein (e.g., the software functionality performed by the Intercept Processor of FIG. 1), in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The computer system 90 comprises a processor 91, an input device 92 coupled to the processor 91, an output device 93 coupled to the processor 91, and memory devices 94 and 95 each coupled to the processor 91.

The computer code 97 includes algorithms for implementing any software functionality described herein. The processor 91 executes the computer code 97. The memory device 94 includes input data 96. The input data 96 includes input required by the computer code 97. The output device 93 displays output from the computer code 97. Either or both memory devices 94 and 95 (or one or more additional memory devices not shown in FIG. 5) may be used as a computer usable medium (or a computer readable medium or a program storage device) having a computer readable program code embodied therein and/or having other data stored therein, wherein the computer readable program code comprises the computer code 97. Generally, a computer program product (or, alternatively, an article of manufacture) of the computer system 90 may comprise said computer usable medium (or said program storage device). While FIG. 5 shows the computer system 90 as a particular configuration of hardware and software, any configuration of hardware and software, as would be known to a person of ordinary skill in the art, may be utilized for the purposes stated supra in conjunction with the particular computer system 90 of FIG. 10. For example, the memory devices 94 and 95 may be portions of a single memory device rather than separate memory devices. The present invention thus includes a computer-based product which may be hosted on a storage medium and include instructions which can be used to program a computer to perform a process in accordance with the present invention. This storage medium can include, but is not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disk, optical disk, CD-ROMS, magneto-optical disks, ROMS, RAMS, EPROMS, EEPROMS, flash memory, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions. Obviously, numerous additional modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. While particular embodiments of the present invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, many modifications and changes will become apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the appended claims are intended to encompass all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of this invention. APPENDIX A—DEFINITIONS AND GLOSSARY Application Program Interface (“API”)—A set of operating system functions that an application program can use to perform tasks such as, but not limited to, managing files and displaying information on the computer screen. An API can include definitions of the operating system functions available to an application program, and it also describes how the application program should use those functions. Can also include the Object Program Layer and associated Objects. In operating systems that support a graphical user interface, the API can also defines functions to support windows, icons, pull-down menus, and other components of the interface. In network operating systems, an API can define a standard method application programs can use to take advantage of all the network features. An API can also be thought of as a communication protocol or open standard by which two computers or computer systems can communicate. Application Service Provider (“ASP”)—An organization that extends the service or functionality of software applications. An online outsourcer or hosting service for software applications, letting companies rent instead of buy software applications and services such as auctions, exchanges and catalog aggregation. Many application vendors are moving to a hosting model, but ASPs are often application-agnostic, plugging a feature of one application into a marketplace when appropriate, and using another feature from another vendor elsewhere. Audit and Verify (“AV”)—The systematic examination of some or all of the following items: data required for the initial calculation of a transaction including, but not limited to, transaction data fields (as defined) authorization fields collected by the parties to a transaction and employed in determining the propriety, legality, and mathematical accuracy of proposed or consummated transactions. To the extent such processes are performed by software or systems provided by a GSP or other service provider, includes the process of calculating or re-calculating transaction(s) for the determination of tax or taxes. Audited Transaction Data Fields (“ATDF”)—All data contained in the transaction data fields as well as such data to indicate the transaction data fields have been subjected to, including the types of tax or taxes the transaction data fields were tested for, the results of such tests, variances, if any between the tax liability as provided in the transaction data fields, and tax liabilities, as re-calculated in the audit and verify process, either by the Clearinghouse or a GSP. Authorization & Capture Transaction—Authorization followed by immediate capture. Authorization & Delayed Capture Transaction—Certain credit card company regulations prohibit merchants from capturing credit card transaction funds until goods and services have been shipped (for goods) or provided for services) to the buyer. Because of this, most credit card processing networks implement a two-stage processing solution, consisting of credit card Authorization, and Credit Card capture. Batch Processing—A type of data processing where related data is transmitted as a group for processing. Business Object—An Object (as defined) designed to accomplish a specific task that will be required on a regular basis and thus can be designed to be invoked over and over by any user, program, or application, thus providing a consistent result. Card Not Present Merchant Account—A merchant account required by a merchant doing business on the Internet. Certified Tax Calculation Application (“CTCA”)—A software application that has been certified by an independent party recognized by the TIJ for producing accurate and reliable tax calculations for the specific type of Tax calculation being calculated. Clearinghouse—An intermediary, independent organization or component of a larger organization which serves as a central agent that accepts or collects and/or accumulates Data from any source including, but not limited to, electronic transmissions of Data, manual transmissions of Data, data streams, taxpayers, tax agents, Electronic Networks, Electronic Payment Networks, tax imposing jurisdictions, government service providers, financial institutions associated with such taxpayers, tax agents, Electronic Networks, Electronic Payment Networks, tax imposing jurisdictions, government service providers, or other organizations, for the any purpose including, but not limited to, storing, editing, aggregating, processing, analyzing, or otherwise acting upon Data, then disseminating or otherwise making such Data and the byproducts or work products concerning such Data that may arise from editing, aggregating, processing, analyzing, or otherwise acting upon such Data, available to, any party having an interest in, or right to access, such Data, including, but not limited to, taxpayers, tax Agents, Electronic Networks, Electronic Payment Networks, tax imposing jurisdictions, government service providers, financial institutions associated with such taxpayers, tax agents, Electronic Networks, Electronic Payment Networks, tax imposing jurisdictions, government service providers, or other organizations, such as a certified public accountant or firm of certified public accounts, for example, for example, that might serve as a registered agent with respect to tax liabilities of certain parties described herein. While not required for a complete definition, the term Clearinghouse can also mean, whether conducted apart from, or in conjunction with, the Data and related functions and information described above, functions that either individually or in some combination, accomplish all, or any one of, the processes including, but not limited to, the management of funds receivable, funds received, funds payable, and funds paid to, parties which may include, but is not limited to, taxpayers, tax agents, Electronic Networks, Electronic Payment Networks, tax imposing jurisdictions, government service providers, financial institutions associated with such taxpayers, tax agents, Electronic Networks, Electronic Payment Networks, tax imposing jurisdictions, government service providers, or other organizations, such as a certified public accountant or firm of certified public accounts, for example, that might serve as a registered agent with respect to tax liabilities of certain parties described herein. Clearinghouse Functions—Those programs and processes enabling entities using the Clearinghouse to perform tasks relating to the administration of the tax laws of tax imposing jurisdictions with respect to the calculation, administration, compliance and collection of such taxes. Computer—Electronic machine capable of performing calculations and other manipulations of various types of data, under the control of a stored set of instructions. The machine itself is the hardware; the instructions are the program or software. Depending upon size, computers are called mainframes, minicomputers, and microcomputers, servers, or supercomputers, including supercomputers employing massive parallel processing. Microcomputers include desk-top and portable personal computers. Credit Card Authorization and Capture—Authorization, followed by immediate capture. Credit Card Authorization or Authorization—The process of verifying the credit, debit, corporate, or other Electronic Payment Network or Electronic Network card has sufficient funds or credit available to cover the amount of the transaction. An authorization transaction generally does not transfer funds. Rather, the authorization process places a hold on the cardholder's open-to-buy limit, lowering the cardholder's limit by the amount of the amount authorized. Can also be referred to as “first step” to the extent there is an Authorization and Delayed Capture Transaction. Credit Card Capture or Capture—The process of charging a credit card for Goods and Services purchased, where the transaction has already been authorized. Credit Transaction—A transaction used for returns and exchanges, where credit is provided for and amount that is equal to, or a portion of, amounts charged by a seller to a buyer, and generally arising from a transaction that occurred between the parties. In the case where a buyer employed a credit card to pay for the transaction, the credit amount will generally be reflected as a separate transaction that has the effect of reducing amounts owed by the buyer to the credit card company, with respect to the purchase. Data—all Information processed within the Network System which can include, separately, collectively, or in any combination, and is not limited to, transaction data fields, audited transaction data fields, transaction data packets, tax liability information, tax information, information arising from the combination or analysis of any data from such sources, as well as associated information relating to funds collected and/or managed, or amounts finds due, funds payable, or funds receivable that arise from their association with or analysis or combination with such information. Data Stream—A collection of transactional data passing through, or saved and maintained by, an Electronic Network or Electronic Payment Network Data Store—Any medium employed to temporarily hold data prior to its transfer to a database, including, but not limited to, RAM, ROM, hard drive, optical drive, etc. Database—A database is a store of data that describe entities and the relationships between the entities. One or more structured sets of persistent data, usually associated with software (a database management system) to update and query the data. A simple database might be a single file containing many records, each of which contains the same set of fields. A more complex relational database allows the definition of data structures, storage and retrieval operations, and integrity constraints. In such a database, the data and relations between them are organized in tables. Examples of software companies that produce and provide databases include, but are not limited to, IBM Corporation (Example: DB2), Oracle Corporation (example: ORACLE 7 or ORACLE 8), Microsoft Corporation (Example: Microsoft SQL Server 7, Microsoft SQL Server 8, Microsoft SQL Server 2000), Sybase Corporation (Example: SQL). Proprietary or other commercially available databases may also be used. Database Replication—The process of duplicating server shares and database objects (usually tables) in more than one location, including a method of periodically rationalizing (synchronizing) updates to the objects. Database Management System—A software mechanism, program, or application, for managing data in a database. Delayed Credit Card Capture—“Second step” of a two step transaction in which a credit card company charges the card of a buyer for an amount generally equal to or less then an amount which was previously authorized by the buyer in the first step of the transaction relating to amounts authorized. Digital Subscriber Line (“DSL”)—A method for moving data over regular phone lines. A DSL circuit is much faster than a regular phone connection, and the wires coming into the subscriber's premises are the same (copper) wires used for regular phone service. A DSL circuit must be configured to connect two specific locations, similar to a leased line. A commonly discussed configuration of DSL allows downloads at speeds of up to 1.544 megabits (not megabytes) per second, and uploads at speeds of 128 kilobits per second. This arrangement is called ADSL: “Asymmetric” Digital Subscriber Line. Another common configuration is symmetrical: 384 kilobits per second in both directions. In theory ADSL allows download speeds of up to 9 megabits per second and upload speeds of up to 640 kilobits per second. DSL is now a popular alternative to Leased Lines and ISDN, being faster than ISDN and less costly than traditional Leased Lines. Distributed Computing—Distributed computing is a software development architectural and/or programming model in which processing occurs in many different places (or nodes) around a network. The processors for this type of system usually function with control distributed in time and space throughout the network. Processing can occur wherever it makes the most sense, whether that is on a server, Web site, personal computer, handheld device, or other smart device. Associated with the distributed process are distributed data storage facilities, including RAM, ROM, hard drives, as well as archival or storage in data stores. Distributed computing is also referred to as distributed processing, cooperative computing, network computing, or collective computing. The definition for this purpose shall also include the principals associated with Grid Computing, which is a means of network computing that harnesses the unused processing cycles of numerous computers, to solve intensive problems that are often too large for a single computer to handle, such as in life sciences or climate modeling. The definitions will also include the principles of parallel processing, which is type of distributed computing which, instead of distributing the workload across multiple computers, distributes the workload across multiple processors within one computer. EIA-232—The EIA standard that defines the electrical characteristics and pin definitions for the 25-pin DB-25 connector used almost universally to connect DTEs and DCEs. Currently at revision “E”, the complete designation is EIA-232-E. It is commonly identified as RS-232 or RS-232C, where RS designates the EIA recommended standard and “C” an earlier revision. The EIA-232 standard is equivalent to ITU-T v.24 and v.28. Electronic Network (“EN”)—Includes any electronic medium through which a Transaction can be measured or recorded, along with the calculation and application of a Tax that becomes associated with such transaction. Examples of electronic networks include, but are not limited to, systems such as: 

 a telecommunications company billing system which measures usage, calculates, and applies associated taxes to calculate amounts due from the cellular phone customer;  an electronic stock exchange system recording the purchase and sale of securities along with the associated amounts owed and due between the parties, resulting in a stock transfer tax or fee due and payable to a tax imposing jurisdiction;  A business to business electronic exchange processing orders placed between buyers and sellers;  An electronic venue providing buyers and sellers with the ability to set pricing for goods and services through an auction pricing or dynamic pricing format as well as fixed pricing formats;  A shipping or logistics company package tracking and billing system which measures and tracks duties, tariffs, or related taxes relating to the movement of products or packages;  Any network employing an EDI format;  A system which tracks sales electronically;  A system which tracks amounts receivable from customers in an electronic format;  Any point-of-sale system maintained electronically. 

Electronic Payment Network (“EPN”)—Any electronic medium through which a Transaction can be settled or paid by the buyer or buyers, transferring a payment to a seller in settlement of amounts owed. Examples include, but are not limited to, systems such as: 

 Credit Card Networks (Example: MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Optima, JCB, Diners Club);  Credit Card Network Processors (Example: American Express, First Data Merchant Services (FDMS) Nashville, First Data Merchant Services (FDMS) South, Global Payments Central (MAPP), Global Payments East (NDCE), Nova, Paymentech, Vital, Wells Fargo Bank);  Debit Card Networks (Example: Maestro debit card network, Master Money Debit Card);  Online or E-mail Based Payment Networks (Example: PayPal);  Micropayment Processing Networks;  Electronic Bill Payment Networks;  Electronic Funds Transfer Networks;  Automated Clearing House Network (“ACH”);  Other Banking Wire Transfer Networks;  Automated Teller Machine Networks (“ATM”) (Example: Cirrus ATM);  Electronic Funds Transfer Networks (“EFT”);  Electronic Check Networks (Example: TeleCheck);  Voice Recognition Bill Payment Networks;  Cellular Phone Payment Networks (Example: Simpay);  Purchasing Card networks, including commercial cards, corporate cards, procurement cards, business cards (Example: MasterCard Business Services) 

Encrypt or Encryption—The process of changing data into a form that can be read only by the intended receiver. To decipher the message, the receiver of the encrypted data must have the proper decryption key. In traditional encryption schemes, the sender and the receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. Public-key encryption schemes use two keys: a public key, which anyone may use, and a corresponding private key, which is possessed only by the person who created it. With this method, anyone may send a message encrypted with the owner's public key, but only the owner has the private key necessary to decrypt it. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and DES (data encryption standard) are two of the most popular public-key encryption schemes. PGP or other encryption/hashing techniques can employ, for example, data symbol encryption such as with direct sequence or frequency hopping spread spectrum communications, where the communications symbols are spread with a pseudo random noise code. Similarly, error detection and correction coding such as an inner BCH code followed by an outer convolution code adds an additional degree of data protection while serving to preserve information integrity. Environment—A collection of hardware, software, network communications and procedures that work together to provide a discrete type of computer service. There may be one or more environments on a physical platform e.g. test, production. An environment has unique features and characteristics that dictate how they are administered in similar, yet diverse, manners. Fault Tolerance—A design method that ensures continued system operation in the event of individual failures by providing redundant elements. At the component level, designers include redundant chips and circuits and add the capability to bypass faults automatically. At the computer system level, they replicate any elements likely to fail, such as processors and large disk drives. Fault-tolerant operations often require backup or UPS power systems in the event of a main power failure, and may imply the duplication of entire computer systems in remote locations to protect against vandalism, acts of war, or natural disaster. Also referred to occasionally as disaster tolerance. Also includes other successor technologies that advance the capabilities described above. Failover—a process or scheme for the transfer of operation from a failed component (e.g., controller, disk drive) to a similar, redundant component to ensure uninterrupted data flow and operability. For example, in multi path driver, if the current path fails, I/O is rerouted through a redundant path so that the system can continue production operations. Also includes other successor technologies that advance the capabilities described above. Fiber Channel—a highly-reliable, gigabit interconnect technology (using either optical or a copper cable) allows concurrent communications among workstations, mainframes, servers, data storage systems, and other peripherals using SCSI and IP protocols. It provides interconnect systems for multiple topologies that can scale to a total system bandwidth on the order of a terabit per second. File Transfer Protocol (“FTP”)—A way of transferring files over the Internet from one computer to another. FireWire—A way to connect different pieces of equipment so they can quickly and easily share information. FireWire (also referred to as IEEE1394 High Performance Serial Bus) is very similar to USB. It preceded the development of USB when it was originally created in 1995 by Apple. FireWire devices are hot pluggable, which means they can be connected and disconnected any time, even with the power on. When a new FireWire device is connected to a computer, the operating system automatically detects it and prompts for the driver disk (thus the reference “plug-and play”). Financial Institution—Includes, but is not limited to, a commercial, investment, or savings bank, trust company, savings cooperative, credit union, brokerage house, insurance company, Electronic Payment Network, Electronic Network, or other institutions, including ones which participate in financial transactions involving cash or financial products and/or services. Goods and Services—It is widely recognized that there are more than 2,000 classifications of goods, products and services that are referenced by tax imposing jurisdictions in the calculation of, or determination of exemption from, taxes. The classification of goods, products and services will include those items included in the definitions applied by the tax imposing jurisdictions, as modified from time to time, whether delivered to the buyer as a physical product or service, or delivered in a digital, or digitized format, such as an mp3 file containing music and delivered via the Internet. Government Service Provider (“GSP”)—Entities generally providing software, services, or some combination of both, to assist tax imposing jurisdictions in the development of software applications designed to incorporate resources from the Web Services Library to access data from the Tax Transaction Warehouse. Such definition can also include firms authorized by TIJs to employ the Web Services Library to access TDF, ATDF, or TDP and related information, and may also include EN and EPN providers to the extent such firms provide services to a TIJ. Grid Computing—A means of network computing that harnesses the unused processing cycles of numerous computers, to solve intensive problems that are often too large for a single computer to handle, or to employ unused processing cycles to process transactions when certain resources are overused or not available, thus avoiding latency problems. Hard Drive—a storage device or collection of devices, which contains one or more inflexible platters on which data can be recorded. Includes, but is not limited to, technologies such as optical drives, where information is stored on high-density disks in the form of tiny pits “read” by laser, as well as any other successor technologies that advance the capabilities of any such storage technologies. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (“HTTP”)—The protocol for moving hypertext files across the Internet. HyperText—A text on the web page that is linked to another webpage. Browsers usually display hypertext as underlined and in blue color. Integrated Services Digital Network (“ISDN”)—ISDN is a public global network capable of transmitting voice, data and images at speeds up to 2 Mbit/s. The digital technique can transport more signals on the same telephone line than the traditional analogue technique and enables a range of new services. ISDN is also referred to as ISO 8877. Intercept Processor—Recognizes and copies data from the data stream which is then routed and processed simultaneously with the data in the underlying data stream. Internet—A worldwide network of computer networks. It is an interconnection of large and small networks around the globe. The Internet began in 1962 as a computer network for the U.S. military and over time has grown into a global communication tool of many thousands of computer networks that share a common addressing scheme. Unlike online services, which are centrally controlled, the Internet is decentralized by design. Each Internet computer, called a host, is independent. Its operators can choose which Internet services to use and which local services to make available to the global Internet community. ISO 8533—A communication protocol consisting of delimited requests and responses between a client and a server, transmitted over a network pipe. Used by many financial institutions to provide credit card authentication and transaction processing. Latency—The time taken to start up an operation. Typically message latency is the time delay incurred between one processor starting a message send operation, and the recipient processor completing the receive operation. Startup latency is the constant communication overhead incurred in sending a zero length message. Communication networks are often rated in terms of latency and bandwidth. Typical values of startup latency: 1 millisec between workstations connected by Ethernet, and 40 microsec with PVM on the Cray T3D MPP computer. Local Area Network (“LAN”)—A computer communications system limited to no more than a few miles and using high-speed connections (2 to 100 megabits per second).

Local Bus—A PC bus specification that allows peripherals to exchange data at a rate faster than the 8 megabytes per second allowed by the ISA, and the 32 megabytes per second allowed by the EISA definitions. Local bus can achieve a maximum data rate of 133 megabytes per second with a 33 MHz bus speed, 148 megabytes per second with a 40 MHz bus, or 267 megabytes per second with a 50 MHz bus. VESAs video cards have been the main peripheral to benefit from local bus use. Also defined as, a fast expansion bus found on 486 and Pentium computers that operates at a higher speed than the old ISA bus and allows 32-bit data transfers. Two types are commonly found: VESA and PCI. Many 486 comps include several VESA local bus slots, but newer Pentium computers use PCI slots. For best network performance, all servers should have VESA or PCI disk I/O and network interface cards (NICs). Metadata—Metadata describes the attributes of an information bearing object (IBO) such as a document, data set, database, image, artifact, collection, webpage, etc.; metadata acts as a surrogate representation of the IBO. A metadata record can include representations of the content, context, structure, quality, provenance, condition, and other characteristics of an IBO for the purposes of representing the IBO to a potential user—for discovery, evaluation for fitness for use, access, transfer, and citation. Merchant—A word used to describe a seller of goods and services, particularly in cases where the seller employs a credit card merchant account to collected payments made by buyers who pay for such goods and services with a credit card. Merchant Account—An account established by a seller of goods and services with a credit card provider, enabling the seller to charge the credit card of a Buyer for purchases. Network System—The invention described in this document in its entirety, including all subsystems. Nexus—The condition of having a seller having sufficient presence in a tax imposing jurisdiction relating to the buyer to be subject to specific laws of that tax imposing jurisdiction with respect to the seller's responsibility, if any, for the collection of tax from the buyer as tax agent for the tax imposing jurisdiction. For instance, in order to be subject to the taxing authority of a state, a person or organization must have sufficient presence in that state, usually established by operating a business or otherwise engaging in commerce there. The degree of presence and the associated specific conditions necessary for a nexus to be formed is typically established by statutory and case law. Object—In programming terminology, a freestanding chunk of code that defines the properties of something, or performs specific tasks. For example, Java applets are objects that contain scrolling list objects, URL objects, button objects, and window objects, etc.. Object Program Layer—A series or collection of Objects designed to accomplish different tasks or functions, either alone or in conjunction with other Objects, including, but not limited to, business rules functions, data query functions, treasury or funds and account management functions, registration functions, Network System user functions, Permission functions, and data writing, re-writing functions.

All application programs use the operating system to gain access to these system resources as they are needed. Optical Disk—A non-contact, random-access disk typically tracked by optical laser beams and used for mass storage and retrieval of generally digitized text and graphics. Optical disks are sometimes referred to as an optical digital disk or optical digital data disk. Types of optical disks include, but are not limited to, WORM (write once read many), CD-ROM (compact disk—read only memory), CD-I (compact disk—interactive), and erasable optical disks. Other Program Communication Methods—Methods of communicating other than those described by the Application Program Interface. These methods include, but are not limited to, software program(s) or application(s) developed that do not require access to Application Program Interface 108 and instead access Database 106 and Clearinghouse 107 directly, processes that communicate certain data via verbal instructions over a telephone to an operator of the present invention, or processes that employ fax machines to communicate written instructions to the operator of the present invention, as well as certain software programs and/or applications designed to enable the Intercept Processor 101 to receive data from the Authorization Processor 102 or the Tax Liability Processor 103 (see FIG. 1). PCMCIA bus—A Local Bus (as defined) that conforms to the standard of the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association, an industry group organized in 1989 to promote standards for a credit card-size memory or 1/O device that would fit into a personal computer, usually a notebook or laptop computer.

Remote Connectivity Technologies (“RCT”)—a collection of potential remote connectivity technologies that might be used in the invention including, but not limited to PSTN, a dedicated or leased high speed digital land line with T-1 to T-3 bandwidth, ISDN links, a WAN, WWW, a Cable Network, DSL, a virtual private network (“VPN”), wireless links such as a cellular network, a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) link, a LEO or GEO satellite link, etc., and other successor technologies that advance the capabilities of such connectivity technologies. Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”)—a protocol (data transmission procedure) transparent to the user that implements three cryptographic assurances—authentication, confidentially, message integrity—and provides secure key exchange between an Internet Browser and Internet Server. Server—A Server is a computer, or a software application that provides a specific kind of service to client software running on other computers. The term can refer to a particular piece of software, such as a Web Server, or to the computer on which the software is running. A single computer may have several different server software applications running on it, thus providing many different servers to clients on a network. Simple Object Access Protocol (“SOAP”)—is a lightweight protocol for the exchange of information in a decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML-based protocol that consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined data types, and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses. SOAP can potentially be used in combination with a variety of other protocols. Tax Imposing Jurisdiction (“TIJ”)—Shall mean any organization (or subsidiary or division of an organization) formed for the purpose of collecting taxes (as defined) for the benefit of providing financial support for functions and services normally provided for the benefit of the residents of towns, cities, counties, provinces, regions, states, countries, or one or more countries working together or cooperating on trading and/or tax related matters, such as the European Union (“EU”), by such towns, cities, counties, provinces, regions, states, countries, or one or more countries working together or cooperating on trading and/or Tax related matters, such as the European Union (“EU”), or the USA (“United States of America”). Functions and services shall refer to any activity deemed directly or indirectly by the residents of such jurisdictions to be necessary and supported by funds provided directly or indirectly by the residents of the jurisdiction, funds raised through the imposition of taxes, or other governmental entities associated with the jurisdiction.

For purposes of this definition, includes circumstances and roles where the tax liability may be assessed on the seller of goods or services rather than the buyer of such goods and services. Taxpayer—Any Individual or entity with an obligation for a tax liability, which is either payable to a TIJ, paid to a TIJ, to be collected from or refinded by a TIJ, or later collected by such individual or entity from a TIJ. Transaction—An exchange of goods or services (as defined) between any two or more parties where at least one of the parties is located in any tax imposing jurisdiction, and generates a value against which a tax liability is either created, or is determined to be exempt from the imposition of tax. Also includes the provision of goods or services in some combination against which a tax liability is either created, or is determined to be exempt from the imposition of tax. Transaction Data Fields (“TDF”)—Includes all or some of, but is not be limited to: 

 Seller identification data, enabling the system to identify, either at the transaction level, or at the system registration level: 
         Seller's unique tax identification number or numbers;  Seller name;  Seller's address;  Seller's zip code, geo code, postal code, or other unique location identifier;

A verified tax paid or due to be paid to each tax imposing jurisdiction of the transaction. 


It is expressly understood that any, all, or certain combinations of Data described in this definition may, in order to remain compliant with privacy and other laws and practices, need to remain confidential and thus not disclosed through the Clearinghouse or to other participants, including but not limited to, merchants, government service providers, and tax imposing jurisdictions. Tax Liability—The amount of tax owed by a party responsible for the payment of such tax, to a tax imposing jurisdiction, based upon the application of applicable tax law by the tax imposing jurisdictions having jurisdiction applicable to the transaction, regardless of whether such amount is identified and/or calculated as being owed to the appropriate Tax Imposing Jurisdiction. For example, a buyer may make a purchase from a seller having no nexus in the location where the buyer is making a purchase, thus placing the seller in a position where it may not have to calculate an amount of tax payable, since the seller has no responsibility to identify, calculate, or collect such amounts. However, based upon the laws of the applicable tax imposing jurisdiction, a tax liability may exist with respect to such transaction on the buyer based upon applicable tax law, even if the seller does not identify, calculate, or attempt to collect such tax. Tax Transaction Identification Number (“Tax Transaction ID” or “TTID”)—A unique identification number created by the Network System and assigned to a transaction and associated transaction data fields that have occurred with through an EN or EPN. Telnet—A protocol for remote computing on the Internet. It allows a computer to act as a remote terminal on another machine, anywhere on the Internet. This means that when you telnet to a particular host and port, the remote computer (which must have a telnet server) accepts input directly from your computer (which must have a telnet client) and output for your session is directed to your screen. Transaction Data Packet (“TDP”)—A unit of data comprising the information about a single transaction including (a) any or all tax data fields or audited tax data fields, (b) applicable tax or taxes, and (c) associated tax imposing jurisdictions, (d) information relating to the results of the audit and verify process, to the extent such process has been applied, as well as information to later determine the parties with permission to access such data. Such unit of data may or may not be encrypted. Transaction Data Warehouse—A Database containing but not limited to transaction data packets, transaction data fields, and audited transaction data fields, aggregated from one or many different Electronic Networks or electronic payment networks and available to users on a real time basis. Treasury Functions—Those aspects of the current invention associated with the managing and transferring of funds relating to taxes from the EN, EPN, Buyer, Seller, financial accounts managed by the EN or EPN, as well as financial accounts maintained as part of the present invention. Universal Serial Bus (USB)—An interface standard for connecting peripheral devices to computers. Hardware components for implementing a USB interface include connector ports on computers and cables for connecting peripheral devices to the computer. The USB standard supports data transfer rates of 12 Mbps. A single USB port can be used to connect up to 127 peripheral devices. Usenet—A worldwide bulletin board system that can be accessed through the Internet or through many online services. VMEbus—(Versa Module Europa) is a fast, flexible, open-ended bus system that uses the Eurocard standard. It was developed in 1981 by Motorola, Phillips, Thomson, and Mostek. VME bus supports a variety of computing tasks in industrial applications. It is defined by the IEEE 1014-1987 standard. VMEbus supports many specialized applications and industries, including: Industrial controls, military, aerospace, telecommunications, medical, etc. vxi (VMEbus extensions for Instrumentation) is a platform created in 1987 by National Instruments and a Consortium of other companies in order to define a multivendor instrument-on-a-card standard for industrial applications. Web Services Description Language (“WSDL”)—Web Services Description Language. Any protocol, standard, or language which is used by service interfaces and protocol agreements, among others, for describing access to Web Services. WSDL is independent for the underlying service implementation language or component model. Web Services Library—Automated resources accessed via the Internet. Web services are software-powered (automated) resources, applications or functional components whose capabilities can be accessed at an internet URL. Standards-based web services use XML or similar data protocols to interact with each other. This allows them to link up on demand using loose coupling. It is important to note that while the resources might be accessed via the Internet, final implementations can be run through many different computing environments, including distributed computing, and through many different communication methods or environments, including LCT and RCT. Wide Area Information Server (“WAIS”)—A commercial software package that allows the indexing of huge quantities of information, and then making those indices searchable across networks such as the Internet. A prominent feature of WAIS is that the search results are ranked according to how relevant the hits are, and that subsequent searches can find more stuff like that last batch and thus refine the search process. Wide Area Network (“WAN”)—A physical or logical network that provides capabilities for a number of independent devices to communicate with each other over a common transmission-interconnected topology in geographic areas larger than those served by local area networks. World Wide Web (“WWW”)—Loosely used, the WWW (or “www” or “Web”) refers to the whole constellation of resources that can be accessed using gopher, FTP, HTTP, Telnet, Usenet, WAIS, and some other tools, including SSL. The WWW is a hypertext-based, distributed information system originally created by researchers at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, to facilitate sharing research information and has been extended to include many different protocols, computer languages, and data formats. The Web presents the user with documents, called web pages, full of links to other documents or information systems. Selecting one of these links, the user can access more information about a particular topic. Web pages include text as well as multimedia (images, video, animation, sound). Virtual Private Network (“VPN”)—Network scheme in which portions of a network are connected via Internet, but information sent across the Internet is encrypted. The result is a “virtual network” which is also part of a larger network entity. This allows users to privately share private information over a public infrastructure.
