Precision Medicine








Better Health. Precisely.



Precision medicine is an emerging approach for disease prevention, diagnosis and management that considers each person’s individual variability in genes, biochemical profile, environment and lifestyle. Today, the ability of our metabolomics technology to impact human health is becoming more compelling than ever as the promise of precision medicine rapidly approaches a reality.
On a certain level, all diseases are metabolic; there is almost always a physiological manifestation that is reflected in the patient’s metabolites. While genomics may reveal disease risk, Precision Metabolomics™ may provide a snapshot of the current state of health and actionable information to advance clinical decision-making.

 Unmatched Technology & Clinically Validated Metabolomics-Based Tests 
Monitoring patients’ health, diagnosing disease and making the best treatment decisions for an individual based on their unique characteristics, including their metabolomic profile, enables healthcare providers to provide the right care, to the right patient at the right time. Streamlining healthcare providers’ ability to understand the basis of an individual’s health, disease and treatment response using a single metabolomic-based test will enhance their ability to achieve this objective.
We are uniquely positioned to deliver those insights quickly and accurately using our patented metabolomics-based technology and clinically validated tests.
The strength of our technology is supported by more than 800 publications, including leading peer-reviewed journals such as Nature, JAMA and PNAS. Using our platform as the foundation, we develop and deliver metabolomics-based, clinically validated Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) through our CLIA-certified and College of American Pathologists accredited lab.
Bringing Metabolomics to Precision Medicine
Metabolon’s novel LDT’s include META IMD™ (a test for assessing inherited metabolic disorders), QUANTOSE® IR (a blood test for measuring early-stage insulin resistance) and QUANTOSE® IGT (a blood test that measures impaired glucose tolerance). Our growing precision medicine pipeline is focused on obesity-related diseases, including chronic kidney disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and tests providing metabolic insights that enable proactively promoting and maintaining wellness.
Our industry leading metabolomics technology platform is generating new insights into inherited metabolic disorders and difficult to diagnose diseases such as chronic fatigue syndrome. Our platform also is being used by the world's top pharmaceutical companies, precision medicine innovators such as Health Nucleus and Arivale, and national and regional population health studies led by innovative research organizations such as the University of Cambridge.

Clinical Diagnostics
Product Pipeline












Metabolon delivers actionable information to help clinicians to get ahead of important diseases where diagnosis, prevention and treatment are most effective and change the outcomes.We are using our unique metabolomics technology to develop new clinical tests as part of our Precision Medicine product offerings. Our pipeline of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) has the potential for regulatory registration in the future.
accuGFR™:  A More Accurate & Precise Test of Kidney Function
 accuGFR is being developed as a more accurate and precise test of kidney function to aid in the diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The test uses a single, fasted blood draw to measure four metabolites and provide clinicians with an easy means to precisely determine their patients’ level of kidney function. accuGFR may be used for the quantitative determination of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in serum to aid in the diagnosis and management of renal diseases.
Today, 10 percent of the world’s population has some form of CKD, and millions die each year from its complications. Known as a “silent killer,” CKD can go undetected without signs or symptoms until a person has lost 90 percent of their kidney function. The World Health Organization predicts that the prevalence of CKD will increase nearly 20 percent in the next decade, making it a global public health issue.
Providing Clinical Value Beyond Existing Tests
Approximately 200 million serum creatinine tests are done each year in the U.S. to provide estimates of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a measure of kidney function. However, only about two-thirds of eGFR results are within 20 percent of the patient’s measured GFR (mGFR, the gold standard method). While mGFR is the most accurate procedure for determining GFR, it is a complex, invasive and expensive procedure with limited patient access.
In large studies conducted so far, accuGFR has shown to be more precise and accurate than the standards of care eGFR methodologies based on creatinine or cystatin C (MDRD and CKD-EPI equations). We believe that the superior precision of accuGFR and the fact that it does not require demographic variables has great potential to provide, on a global basis, clinical value beyond MDRD.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) test
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in the U.S. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more advanced, serious form of liver disease and has a prevalence of 3 to 5 percent in the general U.S. population. NASH not only involves excess fat accumulation in the liver, but also chronic inflammation that may lead to progressive hepatic fibrosis (scarring of the liver tissue). This, in turn, can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and death.
Being able to identify whether a patient with suspected or confirmed liver disease has NASH or not, and/or what level of liver fibrosis the patient has, would provide new ways to manage and control this condition, especially as new drugs and treatment options become commercially available.
Global Health Assessment
Clinicians are all familiar with metabolites such as cholesterol, glucose and creatinine. In fact, there are a limited number of metabolites routinely measured in clinical practice. But, what if you could measure hundreds of metabolites from a single sample?
We are developing a comprehensive health assessment product to guide diagnostic and life-long clinical management decisions. This all-in-one panel aims to screen key metabolites that reflect a patient’s health across many areas, such as cardiovascular, kidney and liver health, macronutrient balance, metabolic age, microbiome balance, and diabetes, oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. Our team is currently working with key health innovators and healthcare providers to develop the test.
In addition to wellness screening, there are 60 million cases of undiagnosed disease in the U.S. and Europe, and 350 million cases worldwide. Undiagnosed and difficult to diagnose diseases, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, represent a large and expensive medical challenge. We see enormous opportunity to address the needs of clinicians and patients by applying our wide metabolic screening to this formidable diagnostic process.
