Salesforce is an easy-to-use, cloud-based CRM (customer relationship management) solution used by businesses in every industry to increase sales, generate more leads, improve customer service, and ultimately grow. With no hardware or software to maintain, Salesforce scales to your business needs and helps you keep costs down and do more with small teams.
It’s the business management solution for those who don’t want the hassles of business software — and there’s nothing to install. You simply log in through a Web browser and everything you need to succeed with your sales process, lead generation, and account management is at your fingertips.
In fact, Salesforce CRM solutions save your company time and money by automating tasks that can keep your people from focusing on customers and big picture initiatives. And because our products work 100% in the cloud, they eliminate the need for costly on-premises IT staff, costly repairs, downtime, and software upgrades.

Low setup costs. No hardware, no software, no hassle.
Automatic upgrades: 3 times a year.
Out-of-the-box and customizable CRM to run your business in one place.

Improve productivity for you and your team with integrated email, easy collaboration, streamlined processes, and mobile CRM.

With all your information on customers, prospects, and leads stored on a single online platform, everyone in your business has access to the latest information — no more version control headaches or out-of-date spreadsheets. Need to ensure your salespeople have access to the information they need when out at customer meetings? No problem. Our CRM system is fully mobile, so your data is available on any connected device, at any time.
On average, Salesforce helps our customers boost their sales by 37%. But the benefits of Salesforce CRM for small business don’t end when you make a sale. Customer service benefits, too. Our solutions help to build stronger relationships with your current customers, win new ones, and accelerate business growth. And intelligent marketing automation helps you focus resources on the tasks that really add value, while a common platform for all your data helps to build strong relationships across all your channels, including social, Web, email, and customer call centers.

Manage sales - Salesforce.com




















Run and grow your
business with the world's
#1 CRM solution.






What is CRM?
The definition of CRM is customer relationship management. In a nutshell, CRM lets you store and manage prospect and customer information, like contact info, accounts, leads, and sales opportunities, in one central location. You’ll discover that it’s not just a fancy contact list. Ultimately, a CRM solution is a game-changing piece of technology for every industry under the sun — from retail and manufacturing, to real estate, construction, and many more.
As a result, CRM can help you:

Increase leads
Close more deals, faster
Drive customer loyalty and satisfaction

Salesforce gives you all you need to work smarter and faster, and help you keep your customers happy.

Small business CRM from Salesforce
Even if your customer base is small, no one can keep every interaction — ones that have happened, or need to happen — memorized and organized.
At Salesforce, we believe small businesses can use technology as a force multiplier to punch way above their weight. Our cloud-based CRM solution levels the playing field for your small business.
Because Salesforce is in the cloud, it can grow and scale with your business. You can easily add features from tons of apps in our marketplaces without adding costly infrastructure, and Salesforce upgrades are instantly implemented as soon as they’re available without disruption. With all your information on customers, prospects, and leads stored on a single online platform, everyone in your business has access to the latest information — no more version control headaches or out-of-date spreadsheets. Need to ensure your salespeople have access to the information they need when out at customer meetings? No problem. Our CRM system is fully mobile, so your data is available on any connected device, at any time.
On average, Salesforce helps our customers boost their sales by 37%. But the benefits of Salesforce CRM for small business don’t end when you make a sale. Customer service benefits, too. Our solutions help to build stronger relationships with your current customers, win new ones, and accelerate business growth. And intelligent marketing automation helps you focus resources on the tasks that really add value, while a common platform for all your data helps to build strong relationships across all your channels, including social, Web, email, and customer call centers.

Best Territory Mapping Software



Maptitude territory software gives you a suite of tools useful for creating 
			territories for your business mapping needs. 
		Maptitude empowers sales teams with robust territory management 
	software. 
		
Often a territory is an area that is made up of several smaller areas 
		merged together. For example, sales territories or market areas might be 
		made up of groups of postal zones, counties, or other regions (Figure 1). Maptitude 
		has a territory mapper wizard that can build the territories for you and compute the attributes and 
		demographics of each one. 

CASE STUDY:

VIDEOS:

Build 
					territories with the Maptitude territory mapping tools (7:11min)


Create 
					territory map with ZIP Codes (8:25min)

You can use Maptitude to create territories based on a table or Excel 
		spreadsheet of data; interactively by clicking on features in a map such 
		as postal areas; or manually by drawing whatever boundary lines you 
		require using the Maptitude editing tools. It is also possible to create 
		overlapping territories or territories based on streets. Your 
		territories can be stored natively in Maptitude or in formats including 
		Shapefile, Oracle Spatial, or SQL Server Spatial. 


		Unlike many other mapping and GIS software packages that require users 
		to purchase data separately, Maptitude is a professional territory map 
		creator that includes extensive geographic and demographic data so that you can get started creating territories as 
		soon as you install the software. 
Maptitude has powerful tools for creating territories that include:

A territory manager to create a territory map with ZIP Codes, 
			counties, states or other areas that are balanced by population, 
			number of customers, sales volume, or any other variable (Figure 2).
A Wizard for importing your region, county, or postal data 
			directly into a new territory layer. This tool can also create your 
			territories based on data filters and queries. Further, the 
			territories you create can overlap in as many places as required and can be 
			visualized using an "edge" style (Figure 3). 
A street-based territory tool that provides advanced zone 
			creation capabilities. You can create territories around locations 
			based on the time or distance it takes to travel along roads. Such 
			territories can be weighted by the size of the facility, the number of 
			clients, or the amount of revenue, ensuring that the most successful 
			locations dominate smaller ones proportionately. This tool also 
			allows the complete assignment of a market to your list of 
			locations, allowing your probable market coverage, for example, to 
			be easily visualized by sales representatives (Figure 4).
A straight-line distance tool that determines the areas closest 
			to each of your facilities by building areas of influence (Thiessen 
			Polygons or a Voronoi Diagram), then estimates the attributes and 
			demographics within each area to identify areas that are under- or 
			over-served or to give you a quick visualization of your service 
			areas (Figure 5). 
A Merge by Value utility that uses a field already in a table as 
			the basis for creating territories. The areas, such as postal zones, 
			are grouped based on a field that contains the territory codes. The tool automatically computes the attributes 
			of the new areas using any number of additional fields. 
A tool for manually creating, adding, moving, or splitting areas 
			by drawing boundary lines. You can also add and edit areas using 
			lines from features such as roads, railroads, or rivers. Areas in 
			non-native file formats, including Esri Shapefiles and geodatabases 
			which can have overlapping areas, can be edited and Maptitude can 
			automatically "snap" overlaps as you edit. 
			
Point-and-click and lasso tools for individually choosing the 
			features that make up a territory. For each territory you can view 
			demographic totals (e.g., high-income earners, households) and a 
			count of the number of combined zones (such as Postal/ZIP Codes). In 
			addition, there is control over managing territory overlap. 
			


		Automated Territory Creation

		Caliper has tools for automatically creating territories. These 
		territories can be balanced so that they contain equal numbers of 
		customers, sales, population, or any other value.   

Partitioning organizes postal zones, counties, or other 
					regions into territories based on proximity or similarity, 
					to produce territories that are contiguous, compact, and 
					balanced. Partitioning supports service territory alignment, 
					sales and marketing, redistricting, and many other 
					applications. 
Clustering organizes customers, facilities, or areas 
					into groups that are compact and can be serviced 
					efficiently. Territories can be restricted to a certain 
					size, such as a customer or population maximum. Clustering 
					is very flexible and can be used to solve many problems such 
					as sales force deployment. 


		The automatic territory creation tools are available at additional cost. 
		Please contact Caliper Sales at +1 617-527-4700 or
		
		sales@caliper.com for more information.

          information hidden in your data.

(Click here to
            see a short demo of mapping and analyzing your data with Maptitude)

Maptitude is designed to make mapping sales data easy. With Maptitude you can:

                Define Your Market:
          
Use the included Census demographic data to find the characteristics of the people who
          use your products.

Identify the demographic characteristics of the areas where your customers
            live
Use the analysis tools to aggregate the demographic characteristics within a
            particular distance of your business locations


                Find Opportunities:
          
Find locations with desirable demographics before renting marketing lists, buying
          advertising, or planning new facilities. (See Figure 1)

                Locate Your Customers:
          
Pin map the locations of your customers so that you can better serve them and better
          reach them with your sales message. (Figure 2)

Find where your customers or prospects live and identify how well they are served
            by your existing infrastructure
Determine where to purchase billboard space, which community newspapers to
            advertise in, and in which radio markets to purchase time, to best reach your
            customers
Map sales data for your aggregate customers by Postal/ZIP Code, 
			county, or sales territory 


                Build Sales Territories:
          
Create sales territories out of Postal/ZIP Codes, counties, states, 
		  or any other type of area, share territory maps, calculate the 
		  demographic characteristics of your custom territories, and attach 
		  your own data to them (Figure 3). For more information, see the
			Sales Territory 
			Mapping page.

                Use Your Own Data:
          
Maptitude lets you create maps using your own data. Maptitude has direct access for a
          number of database, geographic, and raster file formats. In addition, you can access your
          data via ODBC from a number of data sources such as Access, Oracle, or SQL Server. You
          can also join and aggregate your data to any of the nationwide geographic files included
          with Maptitude such as states, counties, or Postal/ZIP Codes, or to your own custom
          territories.

                Customize Your Message to a Target Audience:
          
Pinpoint locations that are within your sales area and that have desirable
          demographic characteristics and plan your mail or phone campaign message around them.
          (Figure 4)

                Provide Customers with Web Enabled Access to Information:

          specialized version of Maptitude for designing and running interactive map applications

Early Access Game
Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops.
Note: This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you
									should wait to see if the game progresses further in development. Learn more


What the developers have to say:

Why Early Access?
										“The development of Software Inc. is a one-man operation. I chose Early Access because I'll need feedback, since it’s impossible to uncover all design flaws and issues by myself. The support I’ve gained through Early Access has allowed me to work on Software Inc. full time, which has enabled me to greatly speed up development and give it the full attention it deserves.”

										Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
										“Software Inc. will be out of Early Access when I feel it is ready. This is not a race and I don’t have investors pressuring me into releasing it early. I have a great opportunity to make this game as good as I possibly can. Hopefully, the backlog of patch notes will be testament to my ongoing efforts developing the game at a reasonable pace, while adding interesting new features. I’m aiming for a full release in 2018, but I won’t promise anything!”

										How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
										“You can find the roadmap on Trello at https://trello.com/b/9I286Mhu/software-inc. My plans for Software Inc. change often, depending on feedback and suggestions I receive, or if I stumble upon a good compromise. That said, I have a clear goal in mind to keep me from working on the game endlessly.”

										What is the current state of the Early Access version?
										“The game currently features complex and expansive building mechanics, a very deep market simulation and an engrossing simulation of the day-to-day life of a software company. The game still lacks in content, but it has Workshop support with more to come. The game is not fully balanced and the core gameplay is still being revised.”

										Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?
										“The price will increase as the game progresses from alpha to final release. The game is cheaper the earlier you buy it as a “thank you” for supporting the development of Software Inc. in its early stages.”

										How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?
										“The community plays a huge role in the development of Software Inc. I constantly read feedback, take on suggestions, and I often reconsider my stance on certain features. The development process is a big part of the product, which I believe is the way Early Access is supposed to be. It is important to note that as one developer, there are limits to the amount of feedback I can physically absorb, while still finishing the game and making sure I don’t pass out in front of my computer.”

I've updated Unity in hopes that this issue has been fixed, but it is currently out of my hands.Alpha 9.9.10 changes (Accidentally skipped 9.9.9)Updated Unity to 5.5.4p1 for crash fixLimitation of time skipping when bankrupt has been cut down to 3 hours before deadlineFixesClicking cancel when updating a workshop item would decouple files from workshop item disabling updates permanentlyUndoing after splitting a room which caused a staircase to be destroyed would bug gameSerializable vector would generate random hashcodes causing save game issues in rare casesVarious other fixesAlpha 9.9.8 changesChanged how the topbar barchart represents cashflowDifficulty should change how much timing impacts pre-marketingAdded percentage to product unit barchart tooltipFixesReview score aggregate would tend to cap at 9.5Bug when placing room up against room causing wall objects to be deleted and then undoingDeleting room up against room with a window or door, added extra doors or windows when undoing, which could break gameObjects deleted from changing fence style couldn't be recovered from undo (not applicable in vanilla game)Wall objects deleted due to no longer being on a valid wall (exterior or interior, outdoor or indoor) couldn't be recovered from undoGame wouldn't allow transactions with a negative bank balance even if the amount was zeroBug when having the wall delete tool open on a wall and clicking undoVarious other fixesAlpha 9.9.7 fixes room split bug and some undo bugs.Alpha 9.9.6 is a small hotfix.Alpha 9.9.5 changesQuality degrade warning should take into account that the most skilled employees might not be adding to quality right this secondChange contract progress label from x - y to x out of yFixesUndoing deletion of wall objects, windows or doors after merging and splitting rooms had chance to break gameNext print countdown when selecting printer was wrongVarious other fixesOptimizationsSimplified new employee hitbox, as it were causing huge slowdowns from physics updates with more than a few employees/staff in game (Should see huge FPS increases across all platforms)Disabled hitbox when employee is not visibleEmployee arrival times are now only updated at most once per in-game minuteAlpha 9.9.4 changesAbility to replace wall furnitureFixesUndoing room deletion was carried out top-down making the game not create them due to lack of supportUndoing a merge made on a different floor than the current one would place new room on current floorUndoing moving wall furniture didn't work properlyPrint priority sliders weren't refreshed when loading saveVarious other fixesAlpha 9.9.3 changesMade employee window scalableUndo furniture replacementsMoved undo buttonUndo resets at end of day to minimize abuseCooks will now walk to unassigned canteens to serve food if necessaryAdded personality localizations and fixed "Please wait" panelsFixesFixed undoing staircase deletionSelling furniture and undoing could bug game due to furniture being placed back in wrong orderDeleting server farm would not add all its processes to the unsupported listVarious other fixesOptimizationsReplace dot bar used for personalities with manual Graphics renderingFixed legacy plot expansion codePushed update for Linux that fixes the refusing to launch bug.Alpha 9.9.2 fixesBug when deleting chair and PC at the same timePotential fix for end of day crash on computers with specific graphics card driversThere were no cap on initial funding for subsidiariesVarious other fixesI've decided to hold out on the discount feature indefinitely and to delay controlling subsidiary releases until alpha 10. I've decided on this, as I want to get moving on alpha 10. Alpha 9 has already taken too long. Changing existing mechanics takes a lot longer than adding new ones and I've been anxious about the response to the gameplay changes introduced in alpha 9.To make up for not getting discounts and subsidiary control in alpha 9, I've introduced the long awaited Undo button in build mode. When I'm positive the undo button is stable, I'll release alpha 9 officially and move on to alpha 10. In the meantime, the undo button will auto save every time it's clicked with a 5 second cool down, to make sure your game can be recovered.ChangesAbility to undo in build modeDelete walls between rooms as alternative to right click and mergeAdded names to staff list and ability to assign rooms to staff using a listUpdated Steamworks SDKUpdated to Unity 5.5.4f1FixesFixed bugs relating to cooksCompany filter gets stuck for all releases listVarious other fixes

Manage sales - Salesforce.com




















Run and grow your
business with the world's
#1 CRM solution.






What is CRM?
The definition of CRM is customer relationship management. In a nutshell, CRM lets you store and manage prospect and customer information, like contact info, accounts, leads, and sales opportunities, in one central location. You’ll discover that it’s not just a fancy contact list. Ultimately, a CRM solution is a game-changing piece of technology for every industry under the sun — from retail and manufacturing, to real estate, construction, and many more.
As a result, CRM can help you:

Increase leads
Close more deals, faster
Drive customer loyalty and satisfaction

Salesforce gives you all you need to work smarter and faster, and help you keep your customers happy.

Small business CRM from Salesforce
Even if your customer base is small, no one can keep every interaction — ones that have happened, or need to happen — memorized and organized.
At Salesforce, we believe small businesses can use technology as a force multiplier to punch way above their weight. Our cloud-based CRM solution levels the playing field for your small business.
Because Salesforce is in the cloud, it can grow and scale with your business. You can easily add features from tons of apps in our marketplaces without adding costly infrastructure, and Salesforce upgrades are instantly implemented as soon as they’re available without disruption. With all your information on customers, prospects, and leads stored on a single online platform, everyone in your business has access to the latest information — no more version control headaches or out-of-date spreadsheets. Need to ensure your salespeople have access to the information they need when out at customer meetings? No problem. Our CRM system is fully mobile, so your data is available on any connected device, at any time.
On average, Salesforce helps our customers boost their sales by 37%. But the benefits of Salesforce CRM for small business don’t end when you make a sale. Customer service benefits, too. Our solutions help to build stronger relationships with your current customers, win new ones, and accelerate business growth. And intelligent marketing automation helps you focus resources on the tasks that really add value, while a common platform for all your data helps to build strong relationships across all your channels, including social, Web, email, and customer call centers.

Sales management system

Are you getting the most out of your sales contacts or do you feel they could be used better? A sales management system will help you track leads, manage your sales contacts effectively, and monitor the progress of your deals with ease.
What is a sales management system and why do I need it?
A sales management system is a tool that helps salespeople get organized, manage their contacts better, track their sales deals more efficiently and save them time. In short - a tool that helps salespeople sell more. A sales CRM should also give sales managers a simple yet clear overview of how their team is performing - a tool that helps their team sell better. So whether you’re a small-business owner, a salesperson or a sales manager, a good sales management software will help you drive your sales and reduce headaches.
What makes a sales management system good?
There are plenty of things you need to look out for when shopping for a sales CRM. Above all, you need to make sure that the CRM you’re going to choose suits your needs. The aspects that need to be included in a good sales CRM, according to our more than 40 000 users:
Easy to use
Simple to learn, intuitive
Customizable
Notifies you when to take action
Mobile – accessible everywhere.
Good sales reporting
Cross-platform integrations
Good looking, visual


The problem with "once-a-week CRMs"
To get the most out of a sales management system, people need to want to use it – it needs to be helpful in day-to-day business. Far too often CRMs end up being these tedious and tiresome points of data entry on the final day of the week. The problem here? People forget – they forget deals, contacts and deadlines, which makes the “once-a-week CRM” basically useless.
Eye candy, aka why good looks and ease of use make a difference
A good sales management software is visually appealing and gives the user a comprehensive view of the situation. It’s simple to use, as if customization were a religion and drag-and-drop its holy script. Think about it, every businesses are different, but most people generally like simplicity.
A sales management system that can boost your sales
Pipedrive is a webCRM that gets salespeople and business owners organized. Using the sales pipeline view, you will always know which deals you need to concentrate on and which contacts you need to be emailing, calling or meeting. Nearly everything in Pipedrive is customizable, and it integrates with all the tools you need for running your business. The native mobile apps let you take the CRM software everywhere you go, and ensure you never miss an opportunity.

Best sales-focused CRM I've ever used by a mile. The pipeline views and multiple pipelines are the features that really make it for me. Pipedrive blows all those other bloated junk CRMs out of the water.





Paul Murray,Director, Miller Jackson 





Pipedrive is a sales tool for small teams with big ambitions


We’ve built a CRM tool that’s great not only for salespeople, but also anyone wanting to get super organized and close deals in less time.
About half of our customers liked us so much they switched from their existing CRM; the other half didn’t even know they needed Pipedrive until they tried it.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
