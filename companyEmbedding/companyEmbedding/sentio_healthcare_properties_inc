Joy W. 
Senior Caregiver — Ann Arbor, MI 
 I was a caregiver to my mother who had early-onset Alzheimer. My siblings and I made sure she was fed, clothed, cleaned, and cared for during the 5 years we took care of her. So I have much experience in all of the requirements that are need to aide a mentally ill elder. It takes patience and compassion to care for someone with a mental illness, but it can be done. I have much love and respect for those who take care of others.

A Little About Myself — Ann Arbor, MI 
 In the last 15 years, I have accumulated a vast administrative skill set through personal, educational and occupational experiences and since 2007, I have worked with children between the ages of 0-13 years and Seniors whom have a vast amount of physical, behavioral, emotional, social and cognitive disabilities that require a plethora of therapies and care such as occupational, speech and behavioral therapies, orthopedics's and prosthetic and other needs that I am trained and responsible for provide to each client. Working with long-term care for pediatrics and adults has given me firsthand knowledge and different perspectives into what the families are going to be dealing with, thus allowing me to becoming a better caregiver, advocate, and educator for all parties involved. I am also trained in caring for Seniors with memory care, Hospices care, and many other conditions.

Post Grad Helper — Ann Arbor, MI 
 Hello! My name is Jaz and I'm a bright, smiley, and fun post graduate student in search of a job assisting others while I search for my long-term profession. I am reliable and kind and have always enjoyed helping others. I previously worked with my godmother's elderly mother and enjoyed the time that I spent with her. We were able to talk and play games to build a strong bond that made assisting with other daily living needs, that were difficult for her (bathroom needs, dressing, walking, etc), easier. If you need a reliable, caring person to help with your loved ones, please check me out.

 I am currently taking a year off before graduate school before I go back to work on my master's in occupational therapy. I am interested in working with older adults. I enjoy talking with them and getting to hear what different experiences they have had throughout their lives compared to my experiences. My grandfather had Alzheimer's and I have previously worked in a nursing home that specialized in dementia. I also have experience with people who have a had brain trauma, my job before the nursing home was at a rehab facility. I worked with people of all ages. I would make a great companion for any older adult who just needs someone to talk to. I am willing to clean, cook and other household duties that need to be done along with medication administration.

Bridget C. 
 
 I've been a caregiver for 1 year and have experience with someone in a wheelchair. I can also help with any transfers needed (bed, bathroom assistance, etc...). I can also help with cooking and cleaning if needed. I think the best part about being a caregiver is not only becoming a friend but being able to help someone do everyday activities no matter their condition or limitations.

Christy D. 
Capable And Compassionate Caregiver. — Ann Arbor, MI 
 Ever since I was a Teenager I found helping others deeply rewarding. While I was in high school I taught swimming to mentally and physically disabled children. The job was a catalyst for my future in care-giving. I was a live in companion and caregiver for 6 years for a woman who was on dialysis and had early signs of dementia. Recently I have been working with an elderly couple in their home who have late stage Alzheimer's and Hospice care. I am very comfortable with all aspects of their daily needs. Bathing, medications, meal planning, shopping, light house keeping, companionship and take great pride in providing them with dignity and a little humor! o

Carolyn G. 
Warm And Responsible Teacher Looking For Part-time Work With Seniors — Ann Arbor, MI 
 I'm a doctoral student (in education). I'm especially interested in senior care because of the positive influence my grandmothers have had on my life. (They are seriously the strongest and most wonderful women!) I haven't had a lot of experience working with seniors, but I have volunteered for Meals on Wheels for the past year and enjoyed it a lot, so I am already connected to the senior community in Ann Arbor. I'm responsible and self-motivated and interested in helping out with errands or light housework. Looking forward to meeting you and getting to know you!
