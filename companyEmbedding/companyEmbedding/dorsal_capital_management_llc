Dorsal Capital Offers Ray of Light Amid Clouds over SAC 


					January 24, 2013

					 
                    Stephen Taub
				

					The Redwood City, Calif.-spinoff led by Ryan Frick and Oliver Evans reports it more than tripled assets in 2012.
				



Let’s face it. When you think of former SAC
    Capital executives, you think of the individuals who have been
    charged with insider trading and other illegal acts at the
    beleaguered Wall Street hedge fund.
Of the numerous hedge funds that Steve Cohen’s
    SAC Capital Advisors has spawned, however, Dorsal Capital
    Management is one that has turned adversity into
    opportunity—even success.
In 2012, the Redwood City, Calif.-based firm founded by Ryan
    Frick and Oliver Evans in September 2009, more than tripled
    assets to about $732 million, prompting the firm to close the
    fund to new investors. Dorsal has mostly run under the radar
    but in its year-end letter to clients, the firm said the fund
    may reopen sometime this year. It has "begun to study the
    possibility of a capital-raise for later in 2013," the letter
    says.
Dorsal launched its Dorsal Capital Partners fund with about
    $32 million in assets under management. Besides Frick and
    Evans, the two other partners are Jeff Barnett, who joined in
    June 2009 as chief financial officer and Youli Petkov, who came
    onboard the following month and was promoted to partner in
    2012.
The fund, focused on equity long-short, concentrates on
    technology and consumer companies.
Returns were up 11.3 percent in 2012. Since its September
    2009 inception it has surged 42.5 percent in aggregate, more or
    less in line with the S&P 500.
Dorsal is known for its cautious approach to risk
    management. For example, its Sharpe Ratio, a tricky measurement
    of risk-adjusted returns, is 2.1, considered very good.
The firm is your classic bottom-up, long-short stock picker.
    In the fourth quarter, its gross exposure ranged from 173
    percent to 196 percent, while net exposure ranged from 12
    percent to 17 percent. At the end of the year, it had 43 short
    positions compared with just 24 long positions.
"The tight range…underlies our strategy of relying on
    stock-picking to generate alpha and absolute returns, as
    opposed to trying to time the market," the firm states in its
    year-end letter.
Dorsal points out that in 2012 its longs contributed 19.1
    percent to gross returns, while shorts cost it 3.5 percent of
    its return. "Given our average long and short exposure ranges,
    those contributions represent significantly positive (and very
    balanced) alpha generation on both sides of the book," it
    states in the letter.
The fund’s gains last year were driven by the
    semiconductor and internet sectors. In the fourth quarter,
    Dorsal sold its entire long position in Microsoft Corp. and
    covered about half of its short position in Intel Corp.
Looking ahead, Dorsal says it wants to increase its
    volatility bets, with plans to raise gross exposure above 200
    percent after the fourth-quarter earnings season winds
    down.
However, it stresses it will not deviate much from its net
    exposure.
It also may move the portfolio to more concentrated levels,
    the fund says. This could lead to larger
    drawdowns—peak to trough declines—and more
    down months. But Dorsal is confident it could do this without
    sacrificing its Sharpe ratio.
At present, based on its bottom-up analysis, the fund is
    slightly net-long internet stocks and slightly net-short what
    it calls SaaS, or software as a service.
In general, its bias is toward companies with clean balance
    sheets and big net cash positions. "We believe that many
    technology companies are currently getting no credit for their
    cash," Dorsal says.
Possible catalysts for unlocking this cash: Congress passes
    a law that would incentivize companies to bring offshore cash
    back to the U.S. or some companies use the cash to boost
    shareholder value.
Either way, Dorsal indicates these are the kinds of
    companies it would find interesting.
Overall, it says: "Investors will ultimately be rewarded for
    holding companies that grow earnings significantly
    cycle-over-cycle and trade at reasonable valuations, while
    being short companies that will see earnings disappointments
    cycle-over-cycle, especially when their multiples have become
    stretched."

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
