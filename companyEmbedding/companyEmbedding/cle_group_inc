6 Steps to Improved Client Relationships and Communications

What would be possible if you could read your client to figure out what she really wants?  What if your clients really trusted you because they felt understood?  How many clients have you lost because of a personality clash?
This MCLE class will introduce you to the concept of personality as it relates to client communications and interactions.  We have all had clients who: 
- Never seems to be satisfied with your results
- Wants to have their hand held through everything
- Never gets you the information you request on time
-Seems to be afraid of you, or seems to think you're mad at them
- Cries a lot in your meetings  
Differences in personal styles can be a source of either conflict or increased effectiveness in daily interactions.  The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is a tool to help individuals increase awareness of their own strengths and preferred styles while enhancing their understanding and appreciation for the styles of others.  This workshop introduces the Myers-Briggs and begins an exploration of how it can be used to improve client communication and relationships. 

The main topics covered in the course include engaging difficult clients, clients & personality preferences, the action plan and results.  Further topics addressed include your brain on stress, the ABCs, the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), personality preferences, the four type pairs and the benefits of understanding personality differences.    

The course addresses these six common client communication issues:  
1.  Why won't this client stop talking talking talking?  
2.  Why doesn't that client speak up?
3.  Hello?  What the heck is going on in there?
4.  What does your client really want?  
5.  Why is this client so emotional (or such a jerk?)   
6.  Why can't that client do anything on time?     

Christy Cassisa is a coach, teacher and consultant who has found her passion in working with attorneys to build awareness and understanding in themselves and others. Logical Harmony Consulting MBTI workshops for your team or office provide participants with a more in-depth opportunity to learn about preferred means of communication for problem-solving, decision-making, and conflict management.

A Better Deposition: Dealing with Problem Witnesses and Difficult Attorneys

If you are a trial attorney you have inevitably been forced to deal with difficult witnesses and hostile attorneys at some point in your legal career.  Problem witnesses can take many forms - the dishonest witness, the evasive witness, the hostile witness- the witness that doesn't remember what they had for breakfast.  All too often, witnesses try to frustrate the discovery process - and depositions in particular - by their obstructive and abusive behavior. And we all have stories about hostile or bullying opposing counsel.
This CLE course examines strategies to effectively depose some common difficult witnesses and also provides tips on how to deal with difficult attorneys during the deposition process.  Join trial attorney Roy Comer as he discusses the hostile witness, the basics of questioning, dealing with the problem witness, the forgetful or unsure witness, the dishonest witness and the obstructing lawyer.  Further topics covered by Mr. Comer include controlling the deposition, what doesn't work, the goal of the deposition, the form of questioning, the 4 step process for dealing with the evasive witness, videotaping depositions, looking for visual clues, asking more, quickening the pace, the Duty of Candor, the bullying lawyer, the law is your friend, talking to the witness, the improperly objecting attorney, the lawyer that wants to go off the record all the time, the condescending lawyer and the "I'll fix it later lawyer."
For over thirty-five years Roy L. Comer has been dedicated to handling damage cases, including catastrophic personal injury and wrongful death cases arising from automobile, truck, motorcycle, medical negligence, defective products, and dangerous premises claims. In addition, Mr. Comer has represented individuals and medium-sized businesses in real estate, landlord-tenant, insurance and contract disputes. Defending these types of claims has provided Mr. Comer with further insight into how insurance companies approach these claims. Mr. Comer's clients depend on his broad experience, coupled with the highest legal, professional and emphatic standards.

The person most qualified (PMQ) deposition is a powerful discovery tool or - or a headache of a lifetime - depending what side of the litigation you're on.  Whether you are pursuing remedies against a business entity or defending a corporation, how you plan and prepare for the PMQ deposition will ultimately determine the success you achieve for your client.  With all of the possible traps, do you know how to effectively take, defend, and prepare for the PMQ deposition?In this CLE course, veteran civil litigator Roy Comer provides practical tips and advice for your next PMQ deposition.  When you complete this course you will know how to: indentify what makes a person most qualified, prepare the notice, respond & object to the notice, select the PMQ witness, prepare the PMQ witness, prepare the testimony, take the deposition, spot common traps  and defend the PMQ deposition.  Deposing the person most qualified is drastically different than the standard lay witness deposition and since party admissions are admissible against the company or entity, PMQ depositions can produce valuable testimony that can greatly aid settlement or sway the jury at trial.For over 30 years Roy L. Comer has been dedicated to handling damage cases, including catastrophic personal injury and wrongful death cases arising from automobile, truck, motorcycle, medical negligence, defective products, and dangerous premises claims.

Many types of attorneys need to understand the basics of how to read a financial statement - from criminal law attorneys to family law practitioners.  However, we are attorneys and not accountants, so it's not always easy to understand where to look and how to break down the important financial information in your case.
If you need help in this area join forensic accountants Richard Holstrom and Joshua Vannetti for an attorney's refresher on financial records and financial statements. The main subjects covered include using financial data to tell the story, understanding the various forms of financial statements and the use of income statements in analysis. Further topics addressed include accounting language, the different forms of financial statements, accounting basics, accrual accounting, cash basis accounting, accounting systems, the accounting process, the purposes of financial statements, published financials, types of financial information & statements, the balance sheet, income statement data & sources, the statement of shareholder's equity, statement of cash flows, other sources of financial information, what to ask for and the "so what" moment.
Richard Holstrom currently works at RGL Forensics and has been involved in the field of Forensic Accounting exclusively since 1980.  He has worked extensively with insurance companies and attorneys focusing his career on forensic accounting, measurement of damages and litigation support.  Mr. Holstrom has been designated as an accounting expert in State Courts of California and Nevada and Federal Courts in California, Arizona and Hawaii.  He has provided expert testimony in both depositions and at trial in excess of 100 times in the past 10 years.  Joshua Vannetti also works at RGL Forensics and specializes in litigation support and claims evaluation.  He has worked with attorneys and insurance professionals by performing damage calculations for disputes involving breach of contract, business interruption, employee dishonesty, and similar matters of economic loss.  Mr. Vannetti's previous background in financial institutions lends itself well to forensic accounting as he understands what records are available at the financial institution level, and knows what to look for related to negotiable instrument fraud and embezzlement.

There are currently over one million nonprofits in the United States with over 50,000 new ones created each year.  Everything from labor groups and churches to schools and fraternal beneficiary societies qualify for 501(c)(3) status - if the proper legal formalities are followed.  The IRS recently "cleansed" over 275,000 nonprofits, stripping them of their federal tax-exempt status because they failed to satisfy the IRS filing requirement for three consecutive years.
Join Beverly Hills attorney Kent Seton as he reviews the legal landscape of starting and operating a nonprofit organization.  The main issues discussed by Mr. Seton include nonprofit formation, income tax, board governance and the solicitation of funds.  Further topics addressed include revocation of 501(c)(3) status, setting up a nonprofit, choice of entity, unincorporated associations, charitable trusts, nonprofit charitable corporations, charitable purposes, the private inurement doctrine, self dealing, dissolution, the articles of incorporation, the 501(c)(3) standard, organized and operating for charitable purposes, the source of funding, the board of directors, board meetings, board member transactions, laws regarding the solicitation of funds, Internet fund raising, fund raising professionals & counsel and cause marketing.
Kent E. Seton, Esq., a former collegiate All-American tennis player at the University of Southern California, has spent the last 14 years of his legal career involved in representing charities, foundations and corporations in all aspects of their legal existence. Kent?s experience covers a broad array of philanthropy legal considerations.

If you can help to keep your clients stay out of court, clients will look to you as a trusted legal advisor that they can turn to for proactive legal advice and counseling - and not just the person to call once they've been sued.  Transactional attorneys, nonprofit attorneys and in-house counsel can definitely benefit from this proposition by knowing the key facets of their client's businesses and making sure their legal liabilities are accounted for and properly addressed.  Even immigration attorneys with international clients can serve as a valuable resource to clients coming to America on investor visas by assisting with their client's with basic counseling on starting and running a business.
In this course Miami business attorney Brett Trembly highlights a number of practical and legal points that you can advise your business clients on to help you serve as a valuable resource and keep them out of court.  Brett starts by presenting ten general tips to advise your business clients on, lists four key documents that your clients must have in place, analyzes five essential terms for every contract and closes by highlighting key nonprofit issues.  Further subjects covered include: business formation & structure, keeping good records, business insurance, appropriate security protections, vendors, employee handbooks, being proactive, independent contractor agreements, the articles of organization, the operating or shareholders agreement, client or service contracts, emergency plan documents, terms of service, prevailing party attorneys? fees, forum & venue selection clauses and termination & damages clauses.
Brett Trembly started the Trembly Law Firm over four years ago to work with business owners to resolve their legal issues as quickly, painlessly, and cost-effectively as possible.  In the South Florida legal community, Brett sits on the Board of the South Miami Kendall Bar Association, the Florida Bar 11th Circuit Grievance Committee, volunteers on the Florida Bar Young Lawyers Division Mentoring Program, the Dade-County Bar Associations Rainmakers Committee, and annually volunteers for Miami-Dade County's Ethical Governance Day.  Brett also maintains his leadership emphasis and is strongly committed to giving back, serving as Past President of the Rotary Club of South Miami, President of B.N.I. Superior, Vice-President of the Rotary Foundation of South Miami, Inc., and is a proud member of the Chamber South and Pinecrest and Palmetto Bay Business Associations.

Even the most lucrative sale of investment property includes one major downside - taxes. But what if you don't sell the property and you exchange it instead? A properly structured 1031 exchange allows an investor to sell an investment property and reinvest the proceeds in a new property while deferring all capital gains taxes. But like anything having to do with the tax code, properly structuring and completing a 1031 exchange is an incredibly complex process wrought with pitfalls.This CLE course provides practitioners with a comprehensive review of IRC 1031 tax deferred exchanges and the real estate transactions that utilize this tax deferral strategy. A 1031 expert, attorney J. Paul Spring will mainly cover the history of 1031 tax deferred exchanges, the reasons for employing IRC 1031 and key requirements when structuring the 1031 exchange. This course will also address the following topics: the Starker Exchange, key benefits of the 1031 exchange, REITs, 1031 investment property converted to a primary residence, exceptions, the like kind requirement, leases & options, types of 1031 exchanges, sales contract language, the equal or greater value requirement, flipping properties, the timing of transactions, identifying the replacement property, related properties and reverse exchanges. In addition to discussing the legal requirements of the 1031 exchange, Mr. Spring also discusses number practical considerations that arise in these complex transactions.Mr. Spring has been a practicing attorney in California for more than thirty years, specializing in real estate, title insurance, business law, tax-deferred exchanges, trust law and short-sale transactions. He is currently the President of Investment Capital Resources.

Others may have suffered illnesses that have kept them from working.  As a result, these unfortunate people that have been falling behind on their bills are now getting calls, letters and lawsuits from debt collectors demanding payment.  While debt collectors are legally entitled to attempt to collect, there are limits to how the debt may be collected and there are several laws that govern how debt collectors may legally proceed.
In this course, civil litigation attorney Patrick Howe provides an overview of the laws governing the fair collection of debts.  The main areas addressed by Mr. Howe include debt collection, the main sections of the FDCPA and statutory violations under the FDCPA.  Additional issues discussed include recent economic trends, the two main concerns of the FDCPA, where to file the FDCPA lawsuit, the California Rosenthal Act, the purpose of the FDCPA, the four elements of the statute, debt collectors, the rationale of the FDCPA, the collector?s goal, contacting third parties, improper time, place & method, harassment & abuse, lying and the first contact rule.
Patrick M. Howe has been a civil litigation attorney for 20 years.  Mr. Howe opened his own law office in 2009, after spending 18 years practicing with two large regional and national law firms in San Diego and San Francisco.  Part of his practice is devoted to the representation of consumers in abusive debt collection cases under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and California's Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  In 20 years as a civil litigator, Mr. Howe has represented businesses and individuals in all types of cases, including matters involving business disputes, insurance claim disputes, insurance coverage, serious injuries, dangerous products, employment disputes, malicious prosecution, fraud, defamation and construction issues.

Yes, this time it will really happen.  Over a decade in the works, California is very close to finalizing a new set of ethics rules. The latest three-year rules revision effort is nearly complete and the new Rules of Professional Conduct will soon become a reality for all attorneys in California once the Supreme Court approves them. But what can you expect… drastic change or much ado about nothing?To learn more about how you will be impacted by the new California Rules of Professional Conduct join trial attorney and ethics expert Ed McIntyre as he fills you in on what to expect from the new rules. Ed discusses the following rule changes: confidentiality, diligence, conflicts of interests, duties to former clients, safekeeping of client property, delay of litigation, fairness to opposing counsel, lawyer as a witness, candor to the tribunal, truthfulness in statements to others, communications with unrepresented persons, inadvertent production and the duties of supervising attorneys.  Ed will mainly address how the new rules will vary from exiting California ethics rules and he also compares the new proposed rules to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.
A veteran trial attorney, Edward J. McIntyre practices complex business litigation in federal and state courts. An expert on the topic of professional responsibility, he also now advises and represents attorneys on issues of professional responsibility, risk mitigation and professional negligence issues.

In a recent case, a U.S. Magistrate Judge sanctioned an attorney for telling opposing counsel it wasn’t “becoming of a woman” to raise her voice during a contentious deposition.

For the past several years, asset protection has been one of the fastest growing areas of law.  Asset protection is also one of the most controversial because the goal is to shield assets from the reach of creditors.  Asset protection should simply be about structuring the ownership of one's assets to safeguard them from potential future risks.  Most asset protection structures are commonly used business and estate planning tools - such as limited liability companies, family limited partnerships, trusts and the like.  Properly implemented asset protection planning should be legal and ethical.  It should not be based on hiding assets or on secrecy.  It is not a means or an excuse to avoid or evade U. S. taxes.  There is no one "magic bullet" in asset protection and the term "asset protection" encompasses a number of planning and structuring mechanisms that may be implemented by a practitioner to minimize a client's exposure to risk.
For each client the asset protection solution will be different, depending on the identity of the debtor, the nature of the claim, the identity of the creditor and the nature of the assets.  These are four threshold factors that are either expressly or implicitly analyzed in each asset protection case. The analysis of these four factors determines what planning would be possible and effective for a specific client.  Join Jacob Stein as he discusses these factors and more in this highly informative and practical CLE course on advanced asset protection planning.  The main topics discussed include the goal of asset protection planning, specific asset protection structures and assets that are commonly protected.  Further issues addressed include the "Home Depot" method, hiding assets, the debtor's examination, principle asset protection structures, proactive vs. reactive asset protection planning, retirement plans, ERISA, life insurance, fraudulent transfer laws, the intent test, constructive fraud, the attorney's liability, transferring assets between spouses, common law & community property states, LLCs, piercing the corporate veil, types of assets, the living trust, revocable & irrevocable trusts, the trust protector, key clauses in the trust, offshore structures, liquid assets, protecting businesses, the personal residence, the equity strip and additional asset protection structures.
Mr. Stein is one of the nation's leading experts on asset protection and is one of California's best-known attorneys, teaching dozens of legal seminars each year on the subjects of asset protection and advanced tax planning. He is a Certified Tax Law Specialist and is AV rated by Martindale-Hubbell. Mr. Stein is the author of numerous articles on asset protection and tax planning, and is the author of Asset Protection Planning (Education Foundation, 2009) and Advanced Tax Planning Techniques (Education Foundation, 2009). He is an adjunct professor of taxation at the CSU, Northridge Graduate Tax Program, and has been an instructor with the California CPA Education Foundation and National Business Institute for many years.

The goal of all asset protection planning is to insulate assets from claims of creditors without concealment or tax evasion.  It is usually impossible to completely and absolutely protect assets, and the focus is on making assets more difficult and more expensive to reach.  All asset protection planning is based on two principle premises: creditors can generally reach any asset owned by a debtor, and creditors cannot reach those assets that the debtor does not own.  In this obvious dichotomy, trusts come to the rescue by splitting the beneficial enjoyment of trust assets from their legal ownership.  This is the main reason that trusts are widely used in asset protection.  Not all types of trusts are effective asset protection devices, but a properly drafted and structured trust may be an almost impregnable form of asset protection.
If you would like to learn more about how trusts are used in advanced asset planning and protection please join Jacob Stein as he provides a thorough and practical overview of this important topic.  Mr. Stein mainly discusses trusts, specific planning areas, asset protection planning, the use of trusts in asset protection and special needs planning.  Further issues discussed include the limitations of trusts, ownership of trusts, key elements of a trust, revocable vs. irrevocable trusts, trust protectors, dealing with real estate, where to set up the trust, estate tax planning, AB Trusts, life insurance trusts, Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT), Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT), the goal of asset protection, the ?Home Depot? method of asset protection, insulating assets, fraudulent transfers, the Intent Test, trusts & asset protection, tax consequences, foreign trusts, choice of law, and needs-based government benefits.

Substance abuse and depression are two of the main contributors that affect an attorney's competence to practice law and lead to high rates of suicide among lawyers. Attorneys are nearly twice as likely to have problems with drugs & alcohol and are nearly four times more likely to suffer from depression when compared to the general population.

Substance abuse and mental health in the legal profession have recently been in the headlines - and for good reason.  Substance abuse and addiction are two of the primary health concerns in the United States and the concern is even greater in the legal profession.  The National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) estimates that 10% of the U.S. population is alcoholic or chemically dependent and the abuse may be as high as 20% in the legal profession.  Since substance abuse and addiction often leads to mental health issues, it's not surprising that suicide is the third leading cause of death amongst lawyers after cancer and heart disease.
Join Susan Brown as she provides insight about the epidemic of substance abuse, addiction and suicide in the legal profession.  The main issues covered include the stressors that contribute to depression, addiction & suicide in the legal profession, the symptom profiles of depression, PTSD & substance abuse, the signs of addiction, where to get help and how to get help.  Further issues addressed include the "culture" of the legal profession, the result of stressors, perfectionism, DSM-V symptoms of depression, symptoms of secondary traumatic stress, "the solution,"  alcohol & other substances, CAGE screening, addictive thinking, consequences of addiction in the legal profession, "real lawyers don't ask for help," suggested solutions, the Lawyer Assistance Program (LAP), the "Other Bar," Lawyers Helping Lawyers and using EMDR therapy for trauma & addiction treatment.

As retirement plans have come to hold an increasing proportion of the nation's wealth, the number of lawsuits claiming violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security (ERISA) Act has increased exponentially.

If you need help understanding the intricacies of ERISA, Russ Petti provides an excellent overview of pursing an ERISA claim and litigation that has arisen under the statue.  The main areas covered include what is an ERISA plan, limitation periods on benefits claims, steps to take before filing a lawsuit, the proper parties, causes of action, evidence in ERISA cases, discovery, the standard of review, reducing the standard of review, ERISA trials and attorney fees.  Further topics discussed include self-funded plans, church & governmental exemptions, exhausting administrative remedies, the administrative record, benefits claims under Section 1132(a)(1)(B), breach of fiduciary duty claims under Section 1132(a)(2), claims for appropriate equitable relief, abuse of discretion & de novo review, reducing the amount of discretion by showing conflict, the Hummel factors and the Lodestar standard.

For patent prosecution, patent prior art research is an essential requirement and one of the critical first steps in the prosecution process. Prior art research should be concluded early on in the process before time and money are expended on the construction of the patent and the application. Prior art research will identify those patent publications that may prevent the innovation in question from being patented and can provide a type of road map in the early stages of development that can assist in providing work arounds of the prior art that will allow the innovation to be patented or used freely in the market.In this CLE course Intellectual Property attorneys Alan Kendrick and Eric Hanscom provide an excellent practical discussion about the best practices when conducing a patent prior art search.  Alan and Eric mainly address the main goal, types & scope of prior art research and patent publication prior art research.  Additional topics covered: patent prosecution, freedom to operate, FTO Research, state of the art research, patentability search, invalidity research, patent landscape research, whitespace analysis, non-patent publication research, discussions with the inventor, strategy development, qualifying terms, searching by number/date ranges, searching by applicant/assignee name or by inventor name, searching by specific data fields and using Patbase.Before beginning his own practice Eric Hanscom utilized his science background and law degree to gain experience in multiple facets of patent, trademark and copyright law and the application of those property rights.  He has been actively involved in overseeing litigation, contract negotiation and customs issues in the US, Asia, Europe, South American and Australia over matters ranging from patent and trademark infringement to breach of contract.  Alan Kendrick has been an attorney since 1998 and his practice focuses on intellectual property matters including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition.  He has several years of experience providing patentability and invalidity research in a wide variety of disciplines including aerospace, mechanical, industrial, energy, medical, materials, food technology and the automotive arts.

California MCLE

California MCLE Requirements

MCLE Requirements and Compliance Information


What is California's MCLE requirement?
25 hours every 3 years, including 4 hours in legal ethics, 1 hour of competence issues (formerly substance abuse), and 1 hour of elimination of bias in the legal profession and society.


When is my deadline?
California groups attorneys into 1 of 3 compliance groups, depending on your last name. The CLE deadline for these groups are: Group 3 (N-Z)Compliance Deadline: Mar 1, 2017Group 2 (H-M)Compliance Deadline: Feb 1, 2018Group 1 (A-G)Compliance Deadline: Feb 1, 2019


How do I report my CLE compliance?
Attorneys are required to report compliance by their deadline by mailing in the affidavit sent to them by the State Bar or electronically through their My State Bar Profile (https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/MyStateBarProfile.aspx). You do not need to send in your certificates or report the individual courses you have completed. 


What if I'm a newly admitted attorney?
New attorneys in California have a reduced MCLE requirement under Rule 2.72(C). The number of MCLE hours you need to complete is proportional to the amount of time you have been a member of the bar. You can find the proportional requirement table here: http://mcle.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/Requirements.aspx#proportional


What if I've been inactive or exempt for part of my CLE cycle?
Attorneys who were inactive or exempt for any amount of time during their CLE cycle are subject to the same proportional requirement as new attorneys under Rule 2.72(C). You can find the proportional requirement table here: http://mcle.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/Requirements.aspx#proportional


What if I don't comply by my deadline?
Failing to comply with the deadline results in a $75 late fee. You must pay the fine and comply by June 30th in the year of your deadline. Otherwise, you will need to request an extension or risk disciplinary action.


What if I take a CLE course outside of the state?
Attorneys can earn credit for courses taken while physically outside of California as long as the course was accredited by an Approved Jurisdiction. The list of Approved Jurisdictions can be found here: http://mcle.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/EducationOptions/ApprovedJurisdictions.aspx



How are CLE credit hours calculated?
CLE credit is calculated by rounding the length of the program instruction to the nearest 1/4.


Can I carry over extra credit hours?
Sorry, according to Rule 2.72(D), attorneys who earn more than 25 hours during a compliance period cannot carry excess hours forward to the next compliance period.


Are LexVid programs participatory?
Yes! All of our on-demand programs are considered participatory in California. That means you can fulfill your entire MCLE requirement right here!


Can I earn self-study credits?
All LexVid courses are participatory. However, you can earn up to a maximum of 12.5 self-study credits [Rule 2.72].


How long do I need to keep my MCLE certificates?

Attorneys must maintain their records of CLE program attendance for one year from the time compliance is reported in case they are audited. All of your LexVid certiifcates can be found at http://www.lexvid.com/account/certificates. To learn more about what to do in case of an MCLE audit, please visit http://mcle.calbar.ca.gov/MCLE/MCLEAuditFAQ.aspx



How can I contact my state's CLE board?
The State Bar of California MCLE DepartmentPhone: 888-800-3400
Email: mcle@calbar.ca.gov


What if I have more questions?
Shoot us an email at support@lexvvid.com or give us a call at 1-877-327-1226. We look forward to hearing from you!


What do I do if I am audited?
The California Bar will notify you via mail and email if your MCLE compliance is being audited. If you are audited, you will need to log into your State Bar Profile and complete the online MCLE Summary Log. Next, you will need to email your certificates of compliance in a single PDF attachment to auditsubmission@calbar.ca.gov. Make sure you reference your bar number in the subject line of the email.Please note that you can download all of your LexVid certificates at once into a ZIP file by visiting http://www.lexvid.com/account/certificates.Failure to submit adequate proof by the stated deadline will result in a $75 penalty, and issuance of a 60-day Notice of Non-Compliance. If such proof and penalty payment is not submitted by the final deadline of October 30th, you will be placed on Not Eligible to Practice status effective on October 31st of your audit year.

Legal Professionals Love LexVid


“Many of our attorneys have used LexVid to fulfill their CLE requirements. The combination
                            of free credits and quality programs has made them a valuable resource at Rivkin Radler.”

                    Kathy Greco
                
Head Librarian/CLE Coordinator
Rivkin Radler
New York | New Jersey


“LexVid is a quality provider and I will use your website in the future. It was a very good
                            experience—the speakers were individually well versed in their fields and I learned a lot
                            from them. This is a part of MCLE, if I am going to put the time in, I want to learn something
                            useful and not just be entertained. LexVid did that for me and I am appreciative.”

                    James Parziale

“Thank you, LexVid. Your website is a godsend for independent and small firm attorneys like
                            myself. I’ve been telling my friends about you and will absolutely come back again for my next CLE
                            cycle.”

                    Greg Stuart

“I want to let you know this is one of the best courses I have ever taken. I am a certified family law specialist in California. Thanks so much.”

“I've found many of your classes are far better than live-CLE, and infinitely easier to attend!”

                    Dan Cutrer
                
Dallas, TX


“I would like to sincerely thank your company for your service. I very much enjoyed the videos I have watched thus far. I have recommended your website to others due to the great variety of CLE courses that you carry, as well as the ease of use. As you know, attorneys' lives are not easy and we often juggle so much. Having a service such as yours is a true blessing to our profession. We often do not have the time to attend in person classes or law conferences. That certainly was the case for me, as I was juggling a full time law firm job and raising two young children.
In addition, your company has generously offered free CLE courses for attorneys. Employers often do not pay for continuing education, which is unfortunate. Luckily, I found your company.
Thank you again for your terrific website and generosity. I will continue to recommend your company to my attorney friends and colleagues.”

                    Michelle D. Volk
                
Attorney, CA


“As an attorney in New York for over four decades, who also served as an Adjunct Faculty Member for Cornell I&LR's Extension Program, I was extremely impressed by the quite knowledgeable and experienced range of lecturers chosen by LexVid. All the Lexvid programs that I chose were given by dedicated professionals who held my interest, and imparted both knowledge and wisdom. I certainly highly recommend this CLE service to all.”

                    Joel M. Poch, Esq.

“Just wanted to thank you for making my continuing education easy and affordable. You offered some great courses that I enjoyed watching at a very reasonable price.”

“LexVid is the best provider I have used in my 33 years as a lawyer. The programs are informative and the site is easy to use. The experts are well informed and qualified. I highly recommend LexVid.”

                    Jerry Newell
                
Retired Attorney, CA


“I have used LexVid for my CLE on several occasions and each time it was a very good experience. The course selections were varied and relevant. The speakers were knowledgeable in their fields and all gave excellent presentations. I will certainly use LexVid to fulfill my CLE requirements in the future.”

                    Camille Hansen
                
Melville, New York


“Lexvid is an excellent, outstanding MCLE provider! The lecturers are as a whole knowledgeable, engaging and keep me awake! The courses are in mostly one hour formats which is very manageable. Their new "Dashboard" makes it easy to access the classes, to access my list of certificates of completion, to keep track of hours taken and the number of hours left. Customer Service is swiftly responsive -- incredibly fast -- and the occasional technical issue is fixed with lightning speed!”

“LexVid is a quality provider and I will use your website in the future. It was a very good
                            experience—the speakers were individually well versed in their fields and I learned a lot
                            from them. This is a part of MCLE, if I am going to put the time in, I want to learn something
                            useful and not just be entertained. LexVid did that for me and I am appreciative.”

“Thank you, LexVid. Your website is a godsend for independent and small firm attorneys like
                            myself. I’ve been telling my friends about you and will absolutely come back again for my next CLE
                            cycle.”

“I've found many of your classes are far better than live-CLE, and infinitely easier to attend!”

“I would like to sincerely thank your company for your service. I very much enjoyed the videos I have watched thus far. I have recommended your website to others due to the great variety of CLE courses that you carry, as well as the ease of use. As you know, attorneys' lives are not easy and we often juggle so much. Having a service such as yours is a true blessing to our profession. We often do not have the time to attend in person classes or law conferences. That certainly was the case for me, as I was juggling a full time law firm job and raising two young children.
In addition, your company has generously offered free CLE courses for attorneys. Employers often do not pay for continuing education, which is unfortunate. Luckily, I found your company.
Thank you again for your terrific website and generosity. I will continue to recommend your company to my attorney friends and colleagues.”

A Better Deposition: Person Most Qualified (PMQ) Depositions



A Better Deposition: Person Most Qualified (PMQ) Depositions
The person most qualified (PMQ) deposition is a powerful discovery tool or - or a headache of a lifetime - depending what side of the litigation you are on.  Whether you are pursuing remedies against a business entity or defending a corporation, how you plan and prepare for the PMQ deposition will ultimately determine the success you achieve for your client.  With all of the possible traps, do you know how to effectively take, defend, and prepare for the PMQ deposition?In this CLE course, veteran civil litigator Roy Comer provides practical tips and advice for your next PMQ deposition.  When you complete this course you will know how to: indentify what makes a person most qualified, prepare the notice, respond & object to the notice, select the PMQ witness, prepare the PMQ witness, prepare the testimony, take the deposition, spot common traps  and defend the PMQ deposition.  Deposing the person most qualified is drastically different than the standard lay witness deposition and since party admissions are admissible against the company or entity, PMQ depositions can produce valuable testimony that can greatly aid settlement or sway the jury at trial.For over 30 years Roy L. Comer has been dedicated to handling damage cases, including catastrophic personal injury and wrongful death cases arising from automobile, truck, motorcycle, medical negligence, defective products, and dangerous premises claims.

An Introduction to Patent Prior Art Research



An Introduction to Patent Prior Art Research
For patent prosecution, patent prior art research is an essential requirement and one of the critical first steps in the prosecution process. Prior art research should be concluded early on in the process before time and money are expended on the construction of the patent and the application. Prior art research will identify those patent publications that may prevent the innovation in question from being patented and can provide a type of road map in the early stages of development that can assist in providing work arounds of the prior art that will allow the innovation to be patented or used freely in the market.In this CLE course Intellectual Property attorneys Alan Kendrick and Eric Hanscom provide an excellent practical discussion about the best practices when conducing a patent prior art search.  Alan and Eric mainly address the main goal, types & scope of prior art research and patent publication prior art research.  Additional topics covered: patent prosecution, freedom to operate, FTO Research, state of the art research, patentability search, invalidity research, patent landscape research, whitespace analysis, non-patent publication research, discussions with the inventor, strategy development, qualifying terms, searching by number/date ranges, searching by applicant/assignee name or by inventor name, searching by specific data fields and using Patbase.Before beginning his own practice Eric Hanscom utilized his science background and law degree to gain experience in multiple facets of patent, trademark and copyright law and the application of those property rights.  He has been actively involved in overseeing litigation, contract negotiation and customs issues in the US, Asia, Europe, South American and Australia over matters ranging from patent and trademark infringement to breach of contract.  Alan Kendrick has been an attorney since 1998 and his practice focuses on intellectual property matters including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition.  He has several years of experience providing patentability and invalidity research in a wide variety of disciplines including aerospace, mechanical, industrial, energy, medical, materials, food technology and the automotive arts.

Authentication of Handwriting in Legal Cases



Authentication of Handwriting in Legal Cases
Have you ever had a case where the authenticity of a signature on a document was at issue?    Cases that involve contracts, wills (even graffiti!!) and other important "writings" often turn on whether it was written by a given person.  When the veracity of writing is at issue in a case, attorneys frequently turn to an expert - a trained forensic handwriting examiner.This presentation details the scientific methodology used by forensic handwriting examiners in order to determine the authenticity of handwriting and signatures.  Mike Wakshull of Q9 Consulting provides an excellent introduction to the tools and the trade of the forensic document examiner. In this highly informative presentation Mike teaches the basic tenets of handwriting analysis, describes natural variations in handwriting, explains the forensic document examiners role, highlights case examples where the authenticity of handwriting is at issue and provides an objective framework for handwriting analysis & authentication.Additional topics covered in this CLE course: the Zodiac case, inter-writer variability, intra-writer variability, handwriting identification techniques, reasons for special cause variation, 21 key elements for handwriting identification, the tools used to examine documents, generally accepted methods of examining documents, handwriting comparison and the difference between simulated writing and disguised writing.  In addition, Mike discusses numerous legal cases that he has worked on around the country over the years.A court-qualified forensic document examiner, Michael N. Wakshull has been involved in the Forensic Document Examination arena since 1983 and belongs to a number of Document Examination Associations.  Mike has been qualified as an expert witness in California Superior Courts and Federal District Court, testifying in cases involving will contests, contract disputes and others.  A wealth of information, Mike frequently presents to legal groups and associations around the country.

Bankruptcy, Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing



Bankruptcy, Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing
Dirty money gets produced by organized crime and other criminals though drug trafficking, prostitution, tax evasion, corruption, financial crime and many other sources.  Spearheaded by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), world leaders and governments have sought to monitor and suppress money laundering and terrorism financing around the globe.  This became even more pressing in our country after the terror attacks on 9/11.  Due to our legal system and anonymous entities like LLCs, the United States is an easy place to hide money and terrorists have begun using our financial and legal systems to launder dirty money and clandestinely move it around the world to finance terrorist and other illegal operations. Unfortunately for attorneys, there is a very fine line between assisting clients and taking part in criminal activity.
Peter W. Bowie, the former Chief Judge of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of California, has seen these matters develop first hand from his view from the bench.  In this CLE course, Judge Bowie explores the evolving link between bankruptcy, money laundering & terrorist financing and the attorney's duty to investigate.  The main topics addressed by Judge Bowie include money laundering around the globe, the use of anonymous entities to hide money and the attorneys increased duty to investigate. Additional topics presented: the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Money Laundering's 40 recommendations, the 2002 ABA Task Force, ABA Formal Opinion 463, risk based client due diligence, how individuals hide money from creditors, the anonymous purchase of numerous high end American properties, the 2016 GlobalWitness.org report, the Panama Papers, confidentiality, attorney-client privilege, Rule 11 and recent case law regarding attorney investigations.

Dealing with High Conflict Counsel



Dealing with High Conflict Counsel
Does there seem to be a lack of civility in our adversarial legal system?  Do you work with clients and opposing counsel that are rigid and uncompromising - who seem to be preoccupied with constantly blaming others for their problems?
One of the unfortunate aspects of legal practice is dealing with high conflict attorneys that seem to permeate the legal system.  Most lawyers would agree that their high-conflict cases take up more time and much more emotional energy than their ordinary cases - sometimes more than all of their other cases combined.  The bad news is that these high conflict personalities appear to be increasing in society, and especially in our courts.  The good news is that understanding high-conflict personalities and opposing counsel can help ease your stress and also help you achieve a better result for your client.
In this highly informative and extremely practical CLE course, Bill Eddy provides you with tips and strategies to deal with high conflict attorneys.  The main issues discussed include the attorney-client relationship, core issues of personality disorder in high conflict attorneys, high conflict personality (HCP) opposing counsel and 10 Points on how to approach HCP counsel.  Further topics addressed include: common high-conflict issues, lack of self-awareness, lack of adaptation, externalizing responsibility, 5 high conflict personalities, causes of personality disorders, brain neurochemistry in HCP attorneys, what to expect from HCP counsel, listening to opposing counsel, picking your battles, responding with B.I.F.F., making proposals, avoiding professional splitting, incivility and support & consultation.

He developed the "High Conflict Personality" theory (HCP Theory) and has become an international expert on managing disputes involving high conflict personalities and personality disorders. He provides training on this subject to lawyers, judges, mediators, managers, human resource professionals, businesspersons, healthcare administrators, college administrators, homeowners' association managers, ombudspersons, law enforcement, therapists and others.

From Harry Bridges to Trump: The Ethics of Federal Disqualification Motions



From Harry Bridges to Trump: The Ethics of Federal Disqualification Motions
Spanning four trials and twenty years, the Harry Bridges saga marked one of the most brutal and longest civil litigation battles in American history in the deportation context. Even after the Supreme Court called it a relentless "crusade," and a veritable case of  "man's intolerance to man," the Executive lawyers and FBI investigators still relentlessly pursued the imprisonment and deportation of one man - Harry Bridges.Attorney, author and adjunct professor Peter Afrasiabi examines the ethical issues related to federal disqualification motions by delving into the fascinating Harry Ellis case and examining President Trump's calls to disqualify Judge Gonzalo Curiel from his civil fraud case due to his Mexican heritage.  By analyzing a number of additional case examples, Peter also highlights the questions related to the timing of bringing these motions, when you should (and should not) bring such motions and the ethical issues associated with disqualification motions. Peter discusses these common scenarios: a judge's prior relationship with parties, a judge's prior relationship with a witness, a judge's prior relationship with lawyer, a judge's public commentary on issues and disqualification motions brought on race-charges.From battles with Madonna over the "Material Girl" brand to fair use disputes with the Eagles' Don Henley to protecting such iconic brands as Bettie Page in trademark and trade dress disputes, Peter R. Afrasiabi primarily handles copyright, trademark, and entertainment disputes.

Hot Topics and Emerging Trends in Cannabis Litigation



Hot Topics and Emerging Trends in Cannabis Litigation

Dispensaries, growers, cultivators and many others now seek to establish their position in this lucrative new industry and their share of billions of dollars in new business.  Unfortunately, the last few years has also seen a massive boom in litigation for businesses in this industry, as these new cannabusineses get snared in litigation and continue to fight federal laws.

How To Avoid A Cultural Minefield In Your Law Practice



How To Avoid A Cultural Minefield In Your Law Practice
In both America and Canada, we have societies that have high rates of immigration.  With high rates of immigration comes groups of individuals that need legal services and support from the legal community - but at the same time bring along certain issues that need to be addressed to properly provide legal services to these individuals.  How can you avoid cultural minefields in your legal practice to fully and ethically represent all your clients?
To learn about the ways that you can avoid running into problems when dealing with cross-cultural issues please join attorney and linguist Suzanne Deliscar as she details how you can avoid key cultural minefields in your law practice.

Keep Calm and Drone On: Regulation and Liability



Keep Calm and Drone On: Regulation and Liability
Very soon our skies will be filled with drones.  Every year millions of drones are bought and put to use by businesses and individuals for everything from conducting surveillance and crop science to filming weddings, bar mitzvahs and other celebrations.  But what happens when the drone your 12 year-old son is flying loses contact with the controller causing it to crash into a local restaurant that then catches fire and is forced to shut down for 1 week?  Unfortunately, drones also have great potential to lead to liability for manufacturers, retailers, pilots... and parents!In this CLE course attorneys Eric Hanscom and Ed Burns provide an excellent discussion of the rise of drones and emerging areas of potential liability.  The main points of discussion include the many uses of drones, drone regulation, drone liability and best practices for legal claims.  Eric and Ed also address the mechanics of UAVs, FAA regulation, commercial vs. hobbyist use, the 333 exemption, local ordinances, flying on federal land, state vs. federal law, liability for those in the chain of commerce, negligence, drones & privacy rights, commercial uses for drones and key points to consider if you are faced with a drone claim.
Before beginning his own practice Eric Hanscom utilized his science background and law degree to gain experience in multiple facets of patent, trademark and copyright law and the application of those property rights.  He has been actively involved in overseeing litigation, contract negotiation and customs issues in the US, Asia, Europe, South American and Australia over matters ranging from patent and trademark infringement to breach of contract.  Edward W. Burns has extensive litigation experience in State and Federal Court and assists clients in protecting corporate intellectual property, including infringement litigation.  Mr. Burns also practices in the preparation, review and filing of corporate documents and filings, employment contracts, independent contractor agreements, and employee handbooks, business contracts, supply and production agreements, sponsorship agreements and leases.

Legal Challenges of Working with Breweries



Legal Challenges of Working with Breweries
With the emergence of Stone Brewing, Ballast Point and thousands of other craft brewers in every corner of the country, the American craft beer industry has exploded over the last decade.    Unfortunately, while these new craft brewers are experts when it comes to barley & hops, they are not experts when it comes to reviewing leases and establishing trademarks.  And often times these brewers are unaware of the most basic legal issues and they want to put all their time, money, effort and energy into making beer - not thinking about distribution agreements.In this CLE program, the craft beer attorney Candace Moon will teach you how to help your brewer clients start and run a solid business.  Candace discusses key legal issues for brewers including selecting the appropriate entity choice, staying compliant with securities law, reviewing agreements & leases, filing state and federal registrations & updates, protecting intellectual property and avoiding labor & employment issues.  The following topics are also covered: TTB (Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau) & state forms, entity protection for owners, changing entities, key points in lease review, distribution agreements, state & federal registrations, obtaining a trademark, banned words, independent contractor vs. employee designation, safety compliance, employment records, knowing your clients, the TTB licensing process & online forms and key questions to ask clients when they walk through your door.Candace L. Moon discovered the need for specialized craft beer counsel while working as a bartender at Hamilton's during law school. While she met countless brewers, there were no attorneys catering to the legally complicated industry. Accordingly, Candace opened a practice serving San Diego's suds. She has since worked with over 200 craft breweries and craft breweries-in-planning nationwide, handling business entity formation, alcoholic beverage law, contract review, trademark law, as well as other legal needs. Candace's undergraduate degree is from the University of Virginia and her juris doctorate is from Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, California.

Obtaining a Green Card Through Marriage



Obtaining a Green Card Through Marriage
Many of us know the plot of the romantic comedy Green Card starring G?rard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell.  In the movie, the two characters enter into a marriage of convenience so that the Frenchman can obtain a green card and remain in the U.S. and MacDowell?s character can rent the New York apartment of her dreams.  Unfortunately, there is much more that goes into getting a green card than simply marrying a U.S. citizen.
To learn more about obtaining permanent residency in the United States through marriage, join attorney Clare Corado as she forever spoils your love of romantic comedies.  Clare mainly describes the three main methods to obtain a green card ? adjustment of status, fianc? visa + adjustment of status and consular processing - and walks you through how you would apply for an adjustment of status for a client.  Further topics discussed include: the ?green card machine? fantasy, the reality of obtaining a green card, the ?bona fide? marriage, additional qualifications, same-sex couples, evidence of a bona fide marriage, marriage fraud indicators, legal standards, and the top 5 reasons an applicant doesn?t qualify for a green card.
Clare Corado is the founder of Corado Immigration Law, LLC, an Indianapolis based firm that focuses on helping mixed-nationality couples build their lives together in the United States.  Her work has been published in Legal Ink Magazine and she frequently speaks to attorneys and other professional and community groups on the topic of immigration law.

Psychology of the Jury: Conducting a Successful Voir Dire



Psychology of the Jury: Conducting a Successful Voir Dire
Jury selection is one aspect of trial practice that attorneys seem to fear the most and it is often an anxiety-provoking situation for both the attorney and potential juror.  One of the golden rules we all learn in law school is not to ask questions we don?t already know the answer to, especially during cross-examination. Well, in jury selection this rule does not apply. You don?t have any idea what anyone might say at any given time and this uncertainty creates a lot of anxiety and concern for many attorneys.
In this course trial consultant Bryan C. Edelman, Ph.D., uses his background in social psychology and the law to demystify the jury selection process and teach you how to better understand jurors and conduct a more effective voir dire. Dr. Edelman analyzes the courtroom experience from the perspective of the juror, provides tips & strategies for conducting a successful voir dire and teaches attorneys how to score jurors on important attributes so that they may more efficiently exercise peremptory challenges and select a jury.  Further topics of discussion include the story model, filters of human perception, personal experiences & jury deliberation, disconfirmation bias, obstacles to a successful voir dire, social pressure in the courtroom, comments from silent jurors, voir dire tactics, getting quiet jurors to talk, asking questions, identifying the pseudo-expert, the minimization effect in high profile cases, sculpting your audience, leadership, developing a scoring system, the wish list, the strike list, the scoring chart and the final review of your challenge decision.
Bryan C. Edelman, Ph.D., began working as a trial consultant in 1998. He has worked on numerous criminal and civil cases.  As a consultant, he applies his training in social psychology, persuasion, group dynamics and social cognition to the courtroom. His particular area of expertise is in complex litigation where jurors are most likely to rely on their prior attitudes, life experiences and heuristics to process evidence and reach conclusions. Dr. Edelman has served as a presenter at national and international conferences and has published a book on the impact of race and empathy on sentencing in capital cases and articles on the influence of graphic images on perceptions of liability and damages.

Securities Crowdfunding in the Age of Kickstarter



Securities Crowdfunding in the Age of Kickstarter
Crowdfunding has been the buzzword in the start-up world for years. But for most entrepreneurs, crowdfunding was almost as mythological as the sasquatch.  While it was possible to fund a business venture through donations by attracting numerous potential investors, there was no real medium to reach out to a wide audience.  Then came Kickstarter, GoFundeMe, IndieGoGo and a slew of other crowdfunding websites. Kickstarter alone has raised close to $2 billion for over 250,00 creative business projects.  However, new rules seek to protect small investors from unscrupulous operators and may dampen crowdfunding by limiting fundraising & advertising while adding new disclosure burdens.
In this CLE program, Crowdcheck CEO Sara Hanks explores the recent revisions to the crowdfunding laws and discusses the potential impacts on both companies and investors.  Among the key issues addressed in this course: Title III of the JOBS Act, what's changed under the revisions, investor limits, exemptions, safe harbors, 4(a)(6) intermediary requirements, prohibitions on funding portals, filing requirements & information, financial disclosures, publicity & advertising, bad actor checks, liability under 4(a)(6) and resale restrictions on securities.  Sara also provides numerous practical points for attorneys when counseling their clients on the positives and negatives of crowdfunding.
Sara Hanks, co-founder and CEO of CrowdCheck, is an attorney with over 30 years of experience in the corporate and securities field. Sara brings a wealth of legal expertise in securities law and start-ups to the emerging marketplace for crowdfunding and online capital formation.  Her position prior to founding CrowdCheck was General Counsel of the bipartisan Congressional Oversight Panel, the overseer of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), chaired by now-Senator Elizabeth Warren.  CrowdCheck provides due diligence, disclosure and compliance services for online capital formation, helping investors get the information they need to avoid fraud and make informed investment decisions, and helping entrepreneurs and intermediaries avoid liability.

The Phone Knows All: Cell Phones, CDR Reports and GPS Tracking for Attorneys



The Phone Knows All: Cell Phones, CDR Reports and GPS Tracking for Attorneys
In 1984, the dystopian novel by George Orwell, due to constant surveillance Big Brother knew your every move. In our new digital world, your cell phone might as well be Big Brother - it knows everything you do. Because cell phones now track your every movement, cell phone forensics and cellular data analysis is now widely used in criminal and civil cases to "place" a person at a particular location based on their cell phone usage.In this CLE course Robert Aguero, a cell phone forensics examiner, teaches you about utilizing data from cell phones and towers in your cases. Robert will address how CDR (Call Detail Reports) are used to track suspects, analyze several CDR reports, show you how to properly read and interpret CDR data & mistakes made by law enforcement in reading the data, discuss how phones can be tracked through the CDR report and detail how accurate or inaccurate that data can be. Additional topics discussed: how cell phone calls are made, MVNOs, what cell towers look like, the information that is available, using your CDR data, data & mobility usage and LTE data. Both civil and criminal must now be knowledgeable about cell phone data in order to effectively represent and advise their clients.Robert has been licensed as a private investigator in the State of California for 17 years. A former police officer and detective, he provides an unbiased, independent analysis of the data on cell phones and GPS units.

6 Steps to Improved Client Relationships and Communications

What would be possible if you could read your client to figure out what she really wants?  What if your clients really trusted you because they felt understood?  How many clients have you lost because of a personality clash?
This MCLE class will introduce you to the concept of personality as it relates to client communications and interactions.  We have all had clients who: 
- Never seems to be satisfied with your results
- Wants to have their hand held through everything
- Never gets you the information you request on time
-Seems to be afraid of you, or seems to think you're mad at them
- Cries a lot in your meetings  
Differences in personal styles can be a source of either conflict or increased effectiveness in daily interactions.  The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is a tool to help individuals increase awareness of their own strengths and preferred styles while enhancing their understanding and appreciation for the styles of others.  This workshop introduces the Myers-Briggs and begins an exploration of how it can be used to improve client communication and relationships. 

The main topics covered in the course include engaging difficult clients, clients & personality preferences, the action plan and results.  Further topics addressed include your brain on stress, the ABCs, the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), personality preferences, the four type pairs and the benefits of understanding personality differences.    

The course addresses these six common client communication issues:  
1.  Why won't this client stop talking talking talking?  
2.  Why doesn't that client speak up?
3.  Hello?  What the heck is going on in there?
4.  What does your client really want?  
5.  Why is this client so emotional (or such a jerk?)   
6.  Why can't that client do anything on time?     

Christy Cassisa is a coach, teacher and consultant who has found her passion in working with attorneys to build awareness and understanding in themselves and others. Logical Harmony Consulting MBTI workshops for your team or office provide participants with a more in-depth opportunity to learn about preferred means of communication for problem-solving, decision-making, and conflict management.

A Better Deposition: Dealing with Problem Witnesses and Difficult Attorneys

If you are a trial attorney you have inevitably been forced to deal with difficult witnesses and hostile attorneys at some point in your legal career.  Problem witnesses can take many forms - the dishonest witness, the evasive witness, the hostile witness- the witness that doesn't remember what they had for breakfast.  All too often, witnesses try to frustrate the discovery process - and depositions in particular - by their obstructive and abusive behavior. And we all have stories about hostile or bullying opposing counsel.
This CLE course examines strategies to effectively depose some common difficult witnesses and also provides tips on how to deal with difficult attorneys during the deposition process.  Join trial attorney Roy Comer as he discusses the hostile witness, the basics of questioning, dealing with the problem witness, the forgetful or unsure witness, the dishonest witness and the obstructing lawyer.  Further topics covered by Mr. Comer include controlling the deposition, what doesn't work, the goal of the deposition, the form of questioning, the 4 step process for dealing with the evasive witness, videotaping depositions, looking for visual clues, asking more, quickening the pace, the Duty of Candor, the bullying lawyer, the law is your friend, talking to the witness, the improperly objecting attorney, the lawyer that wants to go off the record all the time, the condescending lawyer and the "I'll fix it later lawyer."
For over thirty-five years Roy L. Comer has been dedicated to handling damage cases, including catastrophic personal injury and wrongful death cases arising from automobile, truck, motorcycle, medical negligence, defective products, and dangerous premises claims. In addition, Mr. Comer has represented individuals and medium-sized businesses in real estate, landlord-tenant, insurance and contract disputes. Defending these types of claims has provided Mr. Comer with further insight into how insurance companies approach these claims. Mr. Comer's clients depend on his broad experience, coupled with the highest legal, professional and emphatic standards.

The person most qualified (PMQ) deposition is a powerful discovery tool or - or a headache of a lifetime - depending what side of the litigation you're on.  Whether you are pursuing remedies against a business entity or defending a corporation, how you plan and prepare for the PMQ deposition will ultimately determine the success you achieve for your client.  With all of the possible traps, do you know how to effectively take, defend, and prepare for the PMQ deposition?In this CLE course, veteran civil litigator Roy Comer provides practical tips and advice for your next PMQ deposition.  When you complete this course you will know how to: indentify what makes a person most qualified, prepare the notice, respond & object to the notice, select the PMQ witness, prepare the PMQ witness, prepare the testimony, take the deposition, spot common traps  and defend the PMQ deposition.  Deposing the person most qualified is drastically different than the standard lay witness deposition and since party admissions are admissible against the company or entity, PMQ depositions can produce valuable testimony that can greatly aid settlement or sway the jury at trial.For over 30 years Roy L. Comer has been dedicated to handling damage cases, including catastrophic personal injury and wrongful death cases arising from automobile, truck, motorcycle, medical negligence, defective products, and dangerous premises claims.

Many types of attorneys need to understand the basics of how to read a financial statement - from criminal law attorneys to family law practitioners.  However, we are attorneys and not accountants, so it's not always easy to understand where to look and how to break down the important financial information in your case.
If you need help in this area join forensic accountants Richard Holstrom and Joshua Vannetti for an attorney's refresher on financial records and financial statements. The main subjects covered include using financial data to tell the story, understanding the various forms of financial statements and the use of income statements in analysis. Further topics addressed include accounting language, the different forms of financial statements, accounting basics, accrual accounting, cash basis accounting, accounting systems, the accounting process, the purposes of financial statements, published financials, types of financial information & statements, the balance sheet, income statement data & sources, the statement of shareholder's equity, statement of cash flows, other sources of financial information, what to ask for and the "so what" moment.
Richard Holstrom currently works at RGL Forensics and has been involved in the field of Forensic Accounting exclusively since 1980.  He has worked extensively with insurance companies and attorneys focusing his career on forensic accounting, measurement of damages and litigation support.  Mr. Holstrom has been designated as an accounting expert in State Courts of California and Nevada and Federal Courts in California, Arizona and Hawaii.  He has provided expert testimony in both depositions and at trial in excess of 100 times in the past 10 years.  Joshua Vannetti also works at RGL Forensics and specializes in litigation support and claims evaluation.  He has worked with attorneys and insurance professionals by performing damage calculations for disputes involving breach of contract, business interruption, employee dishonesty, and similar matters of economic loss.  Mr. Vannetti's previous background in financial institutions lends itself well to forensic accounting as he understands what records are available at the financial institution level, and knows what to look for related to negotiable instrument fraud and embezzlement.

There are currently over one million nonprofits in the United States with over 50,000 new ones created each year.  Everything from labor groups and churches to schools and fraternal beneficiary societies qualify for 501(c)(3) status - if the proper legal formalities are followed.  The IRS recently "cleansed" over 275,000 nonprofits, stripping them of their federal tax-exempt status because they failed to satisfy the IRS filing requirement for three consecutive years.
Join Beverly Hills attorney Kent Seton as he reviews the legal landscape of starting and operating a nonprofit organization.  The main issues discussed by Mr. Seton include nonprofit formation, income tax, board governance and the solicitation of funds.  Further topics addressed include revocation of 501(c)(3) status, setting up a nonprofit, choice of entity, unincorporated associations, charitable trusts, nonprofit charitable corporations, charitable purposes, the private inurement doctrine, self dealing, dissolution, the articles of incorporation, the 501(c)(3) standard, organized and operating for charitable purposes, the source of funding, the board of directors, board meetings, board member transactions, laws regarding the solicitation of funds, Internet fund raising, fund raising professionals & counsel and cause marketing.
Kent E. Seton, Esq., a former collegiate All-American tennis player at the University of Southern California, has spent the last 14 years of his legal career involved in representing charities, foundations and corporations in all aspects of their legal existence. Kent?s experience covers a broad array of philanthropy legal considerations.

If you can help to keep your clients stay out of court, clients will look to you as a trusted legal advisor that they can turn to for proactive legal advice and counseling - and not just the person to call once they've been sued.  Transactional attorneys, nonprofit attorneys and in-house counsel can definitely benefit from this proposition by knowing the key facets of their client's businesses and making sure their legal liabilities are accounted for and properly addressed.  Even immigration attorneys with international clients can serve as a valuable resource to clients coming to America on investor visas by assisting with their client's with basic counseling on starting and running a business.
In this course Miami business attorney Brett Trembly highlights a number of practical and legal points that you can advise your business clients on to help you serve as a valuable resource and keep them out of court.  Brett starts by presenting ten general tips to advise your business clients on, lists four key documents that your clients must have in place, analyzes five essential terms for every contract and closes by highlighting key nonprofit issues.  Further subjects covered include: business formation & structure, keeping good records, business insurance, appropriate security protections, vendors, employee handbooks, being proactive, independent contractor agreements, the articles of organization, the operating or shareholders agreement, client or service contracts, emergency plan documents, terms of service, prevailing party attorneys? fees, forum & venue selection clauses and termination & damages clauses.
Brett Trembly started the Trembly Law Firm over four years ago to work with business owners to resolve their legal issues as quickly, painlessly, and cost-effectively as possible.  In the South Florida legal community, Brett sits on the Board of the South Miami Kendall Bar Association, the Florida Bar 11th Circuit Grievance Committee, volunteers on the Florida Bar Young Lawyers Division Mentoring Program, the Dade-County Bar Associations Rainmakers Committee, and annually volunteers for Miami-Dade County's Ethical Governance Day.  Brett also maintains his leadership emphasis and is strongly committed to giving back, serving as Past President of the Rotary Club of South Miami, President of B.N.I. Superior, Vice-President of the Rotary Foundation of South Miami, Inc., and is a proud member of the Chamber South and Pinecrest and Palmetto Bay Business Associations.

Even the most lucrative sale of investment property includes one major downside - taxes. But what if you don't sell the property and you exchange it instead? A properly structured 1031 exchange allows an investor to sell an investment property and reinvest the proceeds in a new property while deferring all capital gains taxes. But like anything having to do with the tax code, properly structuring and completing a 1031 exchange is an incredibly complex process wrought with pitfalls.This CLE course provides practitioners with a comprehensive review of IRC 1031 tax deferred exchanges and the real estate transactions that utilize this tax deferral strategy. A 1031 expert, attorney J. Paul Spring will mainly cover the history of 1031 tax deferred exchanges, the reasons for employing IRC 1031 and key requirements when structuring the 1031 exchange. This course will also address the following topics: the Starker Exchange, key benefits of the 1031 exchange, REITs, 1031 investment property converted to a primary residence, exceptions, the like kind requirement, leases & options, types of 1031 exchanges, sales contract language, the equal or greater value requirement, flipping properties, the timing of transactions, identifying the replacement property, related properties and reverse exchanges. In addition to discussing the legal requirements of the 1031 exchange, Mr. Spring also discusses number practical considerations that arise in these complex transactions.Mr. Spring has been a practicing attorney in California for more than thirty years, specializing in real estate, title insurance, business law, tax-deferred exchanges, trust law and short-sale transactions. He is currently the President of Investment Capital Resources.

A Primer on the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)

In today's uncertain economic times, many people are experiencing severe economic difficulties.  Some have had their work hours reduced.  Some have lost their jobs entirely.  Others may have suffered illnesses that have kept them from working.  As a result, these unfortunate people that have been falling behind on their bills are now getting calls, letters and lawsuits from debt collectors demanding payment.  While debt collectors are legally entitled to attempt to collect, there are limits to how the debt may be collected and there are several laws that govern how debt collectors may legally proceed.
In this course, civil litigation attorney Patrick Howe provides an overview of the laws governing the fair collection of debts.  The main areas addressed by Mr. Howe include debt collection, the main sections of the FDCPA and statutory violations under the FDCPA.  Additional issues discussed include recent economic trends, the two main concerns of the FDCPA, where to file the FDCPA lawsuit, the California Rosenthal Act, the purpose of the FDCPA, the four elements of the statute, debt collectors, the rationale of the FDCPA, the collector?s goal, contacting third parties, improper time, place & method, harassment & abuse, lying and the first contact rule.
Patrick M. Howe has been a civil litigation attorney for 20 years.  Mr. Howe opened his own law office in 2009, after spending 18 years practicing with two large regional and national law firms in San Diego and San Francisco.

Yes, this time it will really happen.  Over a decade in the works, California is very close to finalizing a new set of ethics rules. The latest three-year rules revision effort is nearly complete and the new Rules of Professional Conduct will soon become a reality for all attorneys in California once the Supreme Court approves them. But what can you expect… drastic change or much ado about nothing?To learn more about how you will be impacted by the new California Rules of Professional Conduct join trial attorney and ethics expert Ed McIntyre as he fills you in on what to expect from the new rules. Ed discusses the following rule changes: confidentiality, diligence, conflicts of interests, duties to former clients, safekeeping of client property, delay of litigation, fairness to opposing counsel, lawyer as a witness, candor to the tribunal, truthfulness in statements to others, communications with unrepresented persons, inadvertent production and the duties of supervising attorneys.  Ed will mainly address how the new rules will vary from exiting California ethics rules and he also compares the new proposed rules to the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.
A veteran trial attorney, Edward J. McIntyre practices complex business litigation in federal and state courts. An expert on the topic of professional responsibility, he also now advises and represents attorneys on issues of professional responsibility, risk mitigation and professional negligence issues.

In a recent case, a U.S. Magistrate Judge sanctioned an attorney for telling opposing counsel it wasn’t “becoming of a woman” to raise her voice during a contentious deposition.

In this incredibly insightful and practical discussion Andie and Al will mainly address gender disparity in achievement in the legal profession, why gender disparity exists in law firms, ending the gender disparity in law firms and what attorneys can do.

Finally, Andie and Al provide specific action steps for addressing implicit biases and creating policies and procedures that can prevent bias from influencing decisions inside the firm.

For the past several years, asset protection has been one of the fastest growing areas of law.  Asset protection is also one of the most controversial because the goal is to shield assets from the reach of creditors.  Asset protection should simply be about structuring the ownership of one's assets to safeguard them from potential future risks.  Most asset protection structures are commonly used business and estate planning tools - such as limited liability companies, family limited partnerships, trusts and the like.  Properly implemented asset protection planning should be legal and ethical.  It should not be based on hiding assets or on secrecy.  It is not a means or an excuse to avoid or evade U. S. taxes.  There is no one "magic bullet" in asset protection and the term "asset protection" encompasses a number of planning and structuring mechanisms that may be implemented by a practitioner to minimize a client's exposure to risk.
For each client the asset protection solution will be different, depending on the identity of the debtor, the nature of the claim, the identity of the creditor and the nature of the assets.  These are four threshold factors that are either expressly or implicitly analyzed in each asset protection case. The analysis of these four factors determines what planning would be possible and effective for a specific client.  Join Jacob Stein as he discusses these factors and more in this highly informative and practical CLE course on advanced asset protection planning.  The main topics discussed include the goal of asset protection planning, specific asset protection structures and assets that are commonly protected.  Further issues addressed include the "Home Depot" method, hiding assets, the debtor's examination, principle asset protection structures, proactive vs. reactive asset protection planning, retirement plans, ERISA, life insurance, fraudulent transfer laws, the intent test, constructive fraud, the attorney's liability, transferring assets between spouses, common law & community property states, LLCs, piercing the corporate veil, types of assets, the living trust, revocable & irrevocable trusts, the trust protector, key clauses in the trust, offshore structures, liquid assets, protecting businesses, the personal residence, the equity strip and additional asset protection structures.
Mr. Stein is one of the nation's leading experts on asset protection and is one of California's best-known attorneys, teaching dozens of legal seminars each year on the subjects of asset protection and advanced tax planning. He is a Certified Tax Law Specialist and is AV rated by Martindale-Hubbell. Mr. Stein is the author of numerous articles on asset protection and tax planning, and is the author of Asset Protection Planning (Education Foundation, 2009) and Advanced Tax Planning Techniques (Education Foundation, 2009).

The goal of all asset protection planning is to insulate assets from claims of creditors without concealment or tax evasion.  It is usually impossible to completely and absolutely protect assets, and the focus is on making assets more difficult and more expensive to reach.  All asset protection planning is based on two principle premises: creditors can generally reach any asset owned by a debtor, and creditors cannot reach those assets that the debtor does not own.  In this obvious dichotomy, trusts come to the rescue by splitting the beneficial enjoyment of trust assets from their legal ownership.  This is the main reason that trusts are widely used in asset protection.  Not all types of trusts are effective asset protection devices, but a properly drafted and structured trust may be an almost impregnable form of asset protection.
If you would like to learn more about how trusts are used in advanced asset planning and protection please join Jacob Stein as he provides a thorough and practical overview of this important topic.  Mr. Stein mainly discusses trusts, specific planning areas, asset protection planning, the use of trusts in asset protection and special needs planning.  Further issues discussed include the limitations of trusts, ownership of trusts, key elements of a trust, revocable vs. irrevocable trusts, trust protectors, dealing with real estate, where to set up the trust, estate tax planning, AB Trusts, life insurance trusts, Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT), Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT), the goal of asset protection, the ?Home Depot? method of asset protection, insulating assets, fraudulent transfers, the Intent Test, trusts & asset protection, tax consequences, foreign trusts, choice of law, and needs-based government benefits.

Substance abuse and depression are two of the main contributors that affect an attorney's competence to practice law and lead to high rates of suicide among lawyers. Attorneys are nearly twice as likely to have problems with drugs & alcohol and are nearly four times more likely to suffer from depression when compared to the general population.

In this course, Richard P. Carlton presents an overview of the connection between substance abuse, depression and an attorney's competence to practice law. The main topics discussed include the law as a high risk profession, substance abuse & depression disorders, personality traits of attorneys, methods to cope with the stress & the mental challenges of the legal profession and managing the expectations of clients. Further issues presented and discussed include brain chemistry, depression, traits of pre-law students & the effects of law school, lawyers as pessimists, thinking like a lawyer, resources & assistance for attorneys, the stress response, negativity bias, fear & negativity, mindfulness, the pace of life for attorneys and time shifting.Richard P.

Substance abuse and mental health in the legal profession have recently been in the headlines - and for good reason.  Substance abuse and addiction are two of the primary health concerns in the United States and the concern is even greater in the legal profession.  The National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) estimates that 10% of the U.S. population is alcoholic or chemically dependent and the abuse may be as high as 20% in the legal profession.  Since substance abuse and addiction often leads to mental health issues, it's not surprising that suicide is the third leading cause of death amongst lawyers after cancer and heart disease.
Join Susan Brown as she provides insight about the epidemic of substance abuse, addiction and suicide in the legal profession.  The main issues covered include the stressors that contribute to depression, addiction & suicide in the legal profession, the symptom profiles of depression, PTSD & substance abuse, the signs of addiction, where to get help and how to get help.  Further issues addressed include the "culture" of the legal profession, the result of stressors, perfectionism, DSM-V symptoms of depression, symptoms of secondary traumatic stress, "the solution,"  alcohol & other substances, CAGE screening, addictive thinking, consequences of addiction in the legal profession, "real lawyers don't ask for help," suggested solutions, the Lawyer Assistance Program (LAP), the "Other Bar," Lawyers Helping Lawyers and using EMDR therapy for trauma & addiction treatment.

As retirement plans have come to hold an increasing proportion of the nation's wealth, the number of lawsuits claiming violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security (ERISA) Act has increased exponentially.

The main areas covered include what is an ERISA plan, limitation periods on benefits claims, steps to take before filing a lawsuit, the proper parties, causes of action, evidence in ERISA cases, discovery, the standard of review, reducing the standard of review, ERISA trials and attorney fees.  Further topics discussed include self-funded plans, church & governmental exemptions, exhausting administrative remedies, the administrative record, benefits claims under Section 1132(a)(1)(B), breach of fiduciary duty claims under Section 1132(a)(2), claims for appropriate equitable relief, abuse of discretion & de novo review, reducing the amount of discretion by showing conflict, the Hummel factors and the Lodestar standard.

For patent prosecution, patent prior art research is an essential requirement and one of the critical first steps in the prosecution process. Prior art research should be concluded early on in the process before time and money are expended on the construction of the patent and the application. Prior art research will identify those patent publications that may prevent the innovation in question from being patented and can provide a type of road map in the early stages of development that can assist in providing work arounds of the prior art that will allow the innovation to be patented or used freely in the market.In this CLE course Intellectual Property attorneys Alan Kendrick and Eric Hanscom provide an excellent practical discussion about the best practices when conducing a patent prior art search.

California MCLE

California MCLE Requirements

MCLE Requirements and Compliance Information


What is California's MCLE requirement?
25 hours every 3 years, including 4 hours in legal ethics, 1 hour of competence issues (formerly substance abuse), and 1 hour of elimination of bias in the legal profession and society.


When is my deadline?
California groups attorneys into 1 of 3 compliance groups, depending on your last name. The CLE deadline for these groups are: Group 3 (N-Z)Compliance Deadline: Mar 1, 2017Group 2 (H-M)Compliance Deadline: Feb 1, 2018Group 1 (A-G)Compliance Deadline: Feb 1, 2019


How do I report my CLE compliance?
Attorneys are required to report compliance by their deadline by mailing in the affidavit sent to them by the State Bar or electronically through their My State Bar Profile (https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/MyStateBarProfile.aspx). You do not need to send in your certificates or report the individual courses you have completed. 


What if I'm a newly admitted attorney?
New attorneys in California have a reduced MCLE requirement under Rule 2.72(C). The number of MCLE hours you need to complete is proportional to the amount of time you have been a member of the bar. You can find the proportional requirement table here: http://mcle.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/Requirements.aspx#proportional


What if I've been inactive or exempt for part of my CLE cycle?
Attorneys who were inactive or exempt for any amount of time during their CLE cycle are subject to the same proportional requirement as new attorneys under Rule 2.72(C). You can find the proportional requirement table here: http://mcle.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/Requirements.aspx#proportional


What if I don't comply by my deadline?
Failing to comply with the deadline results in a $75 late fee. You must pay the fine and comply by June 30th in the year of your deadline. Otherwise, you will need to request an extension or risk disciplinary action.


What if I take a CLE course outside of the state?
Attorneys can earn credit for courses taken while physically outside of California as long as the course was accredited by an Approved Jurisdiction. The list of Approved Jurisdictions can be found here: http://mcle.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/EducationOptions/ApprovedJurisdictions.aspx



How are CLE credit hours calculated?
CLE credit is calculated by rounding the length of the program instruction to the nearest 1/4.


Can I carry over extra credit hours?
Sorry, according to Rule 2.72(D), attorneys who earn more than 25 hours during a compliance period cannot carry excess hours forward to the next compliance period.


Are LexVid programs participatory?
Yes! All of our on-demand programs are considered participatory in California. That means you can fulfill your entire MCLE requirement right here!


Can I earn self-study credits?
All LexVid courses are participatory. However, you can earn up to a maximum of 12.5 self-study credits [Rule 2.72].


How long do I need to keep my MCLE certificates?

Attorneys must maintain their records of CLE program attendance for one year from the time compliance is reported in case they are audited. All of your LexVid certiifcates can be found at http://www.lexvid.com/account/certificates. To learn more about what to do in case of an MCLE audit, please visit http://mcle.calbar.ca.gov/MCLE/MCLEAuditFAQ.aspx



How can I contact my state's CLE board?
The State Bar of California MCLE DepartmentPhone: 888-800-3400
Email: mcle@calbar.ca.gov


What if I have more questions?
Shoot us an email at support@lexvvid.com or give us a call at 1-877-327-1226. We look forward to hearing from you!


What do I do if I am audited?
The California Bar will notify you via mail and email if your MCLE compliance is being audited. If you are audited, you will need to log into your State Bar Profile and complete the online MCLE Summary Log. Next, you will need to email your certificates of compliance in a single PDF attachment to auditsubmission@calbar.ca.gov. Make sure you reference your bar number in the subject line of the email.Please note that you can download all of your LexVid certificates at once into a ZIP file by visiting http://www.lexvid.com/account/certificates.Failure to submit adequate proof by the stated deadline will result in a $75 penalty, and issuance of a 60-day Notice of Non-Compliance. If such proof and penalty payment is not submitted by the final deadline of October 30th, you will be placed on Not Eligible to Practice status effective on October 31st of your audit year.

Legal Professionals Love LexVid


“Many of our attorneys have used LexVid to fulfill their CLE requirements. The combination
                            of free credits and quality programs has made them a valuable resource at Rivkin Radler.”

                    Kathy Greco
                
Head Librarian/CLE Coordinator
Rivkin Radler
New York | New Jersey


“LexVid is a quality provider and I will use your website in the future. It was a very good
                            experience—the speakers were individually well versed in their fields and I learned a lot
                            from them. This is a part of MCLE, if I am going to put the time in, I want to learn something
                            useful and not just be entertained. LexVid did that for me and I am appreciative.”

                    James Parziale

“Thank you, LexVid. Your website is a godsend for independent and small firm attorneys like
                            myself. I’ve been telling my friends about you and will absolutely come back again for my next CLE
                            cycle.”

                    Greg Stuart

“I want to let you know this is one of the best courses I have ever taken. I am a certified family law specialist in California. Thanks so much.”

“I've found many of your classes are far better than live-CLE, and infinitely easier to attend!”

                    Dan Cutrer
                
Dallas, TX


“I would like to sincerely thank your company for your service. I very much enjoyed the videos I have watched thus far. I have recommended your website to others due to the great variety of CLE courses that you carry, as well as the ease of use. As you know, attorneys' lives are not easy and we often juggle so much. Having a service such as yours is a true blessing to our profession. We often do not have the time to attend in person classes or law conferences. That certainly was the case for me, as I was juggling a full time law firm job and raising two young children.
In addition, your company has generously offered free CLE courses for attorneys. Employers often do not pay for continuing education, which is unfortunate. Luckily, I found your company.
Thank you again for your terrific website and generosity. I will continue to recommend your company to my attorney friends and colleagues.”

                    Michelle D. Volk
                
Attorney, CA


“As an attorney in New York for over four decades, who also served as an Adjunct Faculty Member for Cornell I&LR's Extension Program, I was extremely impressed by the quite knowledgeable and experienced range of lecturers chosen by LexVid. All the Lexvid programs that I chose were given by dedicated professionals who held my interest, and imparted both knowledge and wisdom. I certainly highly recommend this CLE service to all.”

                    Joel M. Poch, Esq.
                
Buffalo, NY


“Just wanted to thank you for making my continuing education easy and affordable. You offered some great courses that I enjoyed watching at a very reasonable price.”

“Absolutely fantastic. Very convenient and provided much great information.”

                    Tighe Taylor

“LexVid is the best provider I have used in my 33 years as a lawyer. The programs are informative and the site is easy to use. The experts are well informed and qualified. I highly recommend LexVid.”

                    Jerry Newell
                
Retired Attorney, CA


“I have used LexVid for my CLE on several occasions and each time it was a very good experience. The course selections were varied and relevant. The speakers were knowledgeable in their fields and all gave excellent presentations. I will certainly use LexVid to fulfill my CLE requirements in the future.”

                    Camille Hansen
                
Melville, New York


“Lexvid is an excellent, outstanding MCLE provider! The lecturers are as a whole knowledgeable, engaging and keep me awake! The courses are in mostly one hour formats which is very manageable. Their new "Dashboard" makes it easy to access the classes, to access my list of certificates of completion, to keep track of hours taken and the number of hours left. Customer Service is swiftly responsive -- incredibly fast -- and the occasional technical issue is fixed with lightning speed!”

“LexVid is a quality provider and I will use your website in the future. It was a very good
                            experience—the speakers were individually well versed in their fields and I learned a lot
                            from them. This is a part of MCLE, if I am going to put the time in, I want to learn something
                            useful and not just be entertained. LexVid did that for me and I am appreciative.”

“Thank you, LexVid. Your website is a godsend for independent and small firm attorneys like
                            myself. I’ve been telling my friends about you and will absolutely come back again for my next CLE
                            cycle.”

“I've found many of your classes are far better than live-CLE, and infinitely easier to attend!”

                    Dan Cutrer
                
Dallas, TX


“I would like to sincerely thank your company for your service. I very much enjoyed the videos I have watched thus far. I have recommended your website to others due to the great variety of CLE courses that you carry, as well as the ease of use. As you know, attorneys' lives are not easy and we often juggle so much. Having a service such as yours is a true blessing to our profession. We often do not have the time to attend in person classes or law conferences. That certainly was the case for me, as I was juggling a full time law firm job and raising two young children.
In addition, your company has generously offered free CLE courses for attorneys. Employers often do not pay for continuing education, which is unfortunate. Luckily, I found your company.
Thank you again for your terrific website and generosity. I will continue to recommend your company to my attorney friends and colleagues.”

A Better Deposition: Person Most Qualified (PMQ) Depositions



A Better Deposition: Person Most Qualified (PMQ) Depositions
The person most qualified (PMQ) deposition is a powerful discovery tool or - or a headache of a lifetime - depending what side of the litigation you are on.  Whether you are pursuing remedies against a business entity or defending a corporation, how you plan and prepare for the PMQ deposition will ultimately determine the success you achieve for your client.  With all of the possible traps, do you know how to effectively take, defend, and prepare for the PMQ deposition?In this CLE course, veteran civil litigator Roy Comer provides practical tips and advice for your next PMQ deposition.  When you complete this course you will know how to: indentify what makes a person most qualified, prepare the notice, respond & object to the notice, select the PMQ witness, prepare the PMQ witness, prepare the testimony, take the deposition, spot common traps  and defend the PMQ deposition.  Deposing the person most qualified is drastically different than the standard lay witness deposition and since party admissions are admissible against the company or entity, PMQ depositions can produce valuable testimony that can greatly aid settlement or sway the jury at trial.For over 30 years Roy L. Comer has been dedicated to handling damage cases, including catastrophic personal injury and wrongful death cases arising from automobile, truck, motorcycle, medical negligence, defective products, and dangerous premises claims.

An Introduction to Patent Prior Art Research



An Introduction to Patent Prior Art Research
For patent prosecution, patent prior art research is an essential requirement and one of the critical first steps in the prosecution process. Prior art research should be concluded early on in the process before time and money are expended on the construction of the patent and the application. Prior art research will identify those patent publications that may prevent the innovation in question from being patented and can provide a type of road map in the early stages of development that can assist in providing work arounds of the prior art that will allow the innovation to be patented or used freely in the market.In this CLE course Intellectual Property attorneys Alan Kendrick and Eric Hanscom provide an excellent practical discussion about the best practices when conducing a patent prior art search.  Alan and Eric mainly address the main goal, types & scope of prior art research and patent publication prior art research.  Additional topics covered: patent prosecution, freedom to operate, FTO Research, state of the art research, patentability search, invalidity research, patent landscape research, whitespace analysis, non-patent publication research, discussions with the inventor, strategy development, qualifying terms, searching by number/date ranges, searching by applicant/assignee name or by inventor name, searching by specific data fields and using Patbase.Before beginning his own practice Eric Hanscom utilized his science background and law degree to gain experience in multiple facets of patent, trademark and copyright law and the application of those property rights.  He has been actively involved in overseeing litigation, contract negotiation and customs issues in the US, Asia, Europe, South American and Australia over matters ranging from patent and trademark infringement to breach of contract.  Alan Kendrick has been an attorney since 1998 and his practice focuses on intellectual property matters including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition.  He has several years of experience providing patentability and invalidity research in a wide variety of disciplines including aerospace, mechanical, industrial, energy, medical, materials, food technology and the automotive arts.

Authentication of Handwriting in Legal Cases



Authentication of Handwriting in Legal Cases
Have you ever had a case where the authenticity of a signature on a document was at issue?    Cases that involve contracts, wills (even graffiti!!) and other important "writings" often turn on whether it was written by a given person.  When the veracity of writing is at issue in a case, attorneys frequently turn to an expert - a trained forensic handwriting examiner.This presentation details the scientific methodology used by forensic handwriting examiners in order to determine the authenticity of handwriting and signatures.  Mike Wakshull of Q9 Consulting provides an excellent introduction to the tools and the trade of the forensic document examiner. In this highly informative presentation Mike teaches the basic tenets of handwriting analysis, describes natural variations in handwriting, explains the forensic document examiners role, highlights case examples where the authenticity of handwriting is at issue and provides an objective framework for handwriting analysis & authentication.Additional topics covered in this CLE course: the Zodiac case, inter-writer variability, intra-writer variability, handwriting identification techniques, reasons for special cause variation, 21 key elements for handwriting identification, the tools used to examine documents, generally accepted methods of examining documents, handwriting comparison and the difference between simulated writing and disguised writing.  In addition, Mike discusses numerous legal cases that he has worked on around the country over the years.A court-qualified forensic document examiner, Michael N. Wakshull has been involved in the Forensic Document Examination arena since 1983 and belongs to a number of Document Examination Associations.  Mike has been qualified as an expert witness in California Superior Courts and Federal District Court, testifying in cases involving will contests, contract disputes and others.  A wealth of information, Mike frequently presents to legal groups and associations around the country.

Bankruptcy, Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing



Bankruptcy, Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing
Dirty money gets produced by organized crime and other criminals though drug trafficking, prostitution, tax evasion, corruption, financial crime and many other sources.  Spearheaded by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), world leaders and governments have sought to monitor and suppress money laundering and terrorism financing around the globe.  This became even more pressing in our country after the terror attacks on 9/11.  Due to our legal system and anonymous entities like LLCs, the United States is an easy place to hide money and terrorists have begun using our financial and legal systems to launder dirty money and clandestinely move it around the world to finance terrorist and other illegal operations. Unfortunately for attorneys, there is a very fine line between assisting clients and taking part in criminal activity.
Peter W. Bowie, the former Chief Judge of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of California, has seen these matters develop first hand from his view from the bench.  In this CLE course, Judge Bowie explores the evolving link between bankruptcy, money laundering & terrorist financing and the attorney's duty to investigate.  The main topics addressed by Judge Bowie include money laundering around the globe, the use of anonymous entities to hide money and the attorneys increased duty to investigate. Additional topics presented: the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Money Laundering's 40 recommendations, the 2002 ABA Task Force, ABA Formal Opinion 463, risk based client due diligence, how individuals hide money from creditors, the anonymous purchase of numerous high end American properties, the 2016 GlobalWitness.org report, the Panama Papers, confidentiality, attorney-client privilege, Rule 11 and recent case law regarding attorney investigations.

Crafting a Simple and Effective Closing Argument



Crafting a Simple and Effective Closing Argument
The way that juries process information has fundamentally changed over the last few decades - you can thank Big Bird and YouTube for that.  Today's jurors are less apt to soak up volumes of information that complex cases require.  Because of this short attention span, you must be as dynamic as possible to grab the jury's attention and persuade them to find for your client.  When it comes to the all-important closing argument, you should keep your message simple, brief and easy to understand.In this fast paced and informative CLE course, you will learn how to provide an effective and succinct closing argument that the jury will be able to process and remember when they walk into deliberations.

Dealing with High Conflict Counsel



Dealing with High Conflict Counsel
Does there seem to be a lack of civility in our adversarial legal system?  Do you work with clients and opposing counsel that are rigid and uncompromising - who seem to be preoccupied with constantly blaming others for their problems?
One of the unfortunate aspects of legal practice is dealing with high conflict attorneys that seem to permeate the legal system.  Most lawyers would agree that their high-conflict cases take up more time and much more emotional energy than their ordinary cases - sometimes more than all of their other cases combined.  The bad news is that these high conflict personalities appear to be increasing in society, and especially in our courts.  The good news is that understanding high-conflict personalities and opposing counsel can help ease your stress and also help you achieve a better result for your client.
In this highly informative and extremely practical CLE course, Bill Eddy provides you with tips and strategies to deal with high conflict attorneys.  The main issues discussed include the attorney-client relationship, core issues of personality disorder in high conflict attorneys, high conflict personality (HCP) opposing counsel and 10 Points on how to approach HCP counsel.  Further topics addressed include: common high-conflict issues, lack of self-awareness, lack of adaptation, externalizing responsibility, 5 high conflict personalities, causes of personality disorders, brain neurochemistry in HCP attorneys, what to expect from HCP counsel, listening to opposing counsel, picking your battles, responding with B.I.F.F., making proposals, avoiding professional splitting, incivility and support & consultation.

He developed the "High Conflict Personality" theory (HCP Theory) and has become an international expert on managing disputes involving high conflict personalities and personality disorders. He provides training on this subject to lawyers, judges, mediators, managers, human resource professionals, businesspersons, healthcare administrators, college administrators, homeowners' association managers, ombudspersons, law enforcement, therapists and others.

From Harry Bridges to Trump: The Ethics of Federal Disqualification Motions



From Harry Bridges to Trump: The Ethics of Federal Disqualification Motions
Spanning four trials and twenty years, the Harry Bridges saga marked one of the most brutal and longest civil litigation battles in American history in the deportation context. Even after the Supreme Court called it a relentless "crusade," and a veritable case of  "man's intolerance to man," the Executive lawyers and FBI investigators still relentlessly pursued the imprisonment and deportation of one man - Harry Bridges.Attorney, author and adjunct professor Peter Afrasiabi examines the ethical issues related to federal disqualification motions by delving into the fascinating Harry Ellis case and examining President Trump's calls to disqualify Judge Gonzalo Curiel from his civil fraud case due to his Mexican heritage.  By analyzing a number of additional case examples, Peter also highlights the questions related to the timing of bringing these motions, when you should (and should not) bring such motions and the ethical issues associated with disqualification motions. Peter discusses these common scenarios: a judge's prior relationship with parties, a judge's prior relationship with a witness, a judge's prior relationship with lawyer, a judge's public commentary on issues and disqualification motions brought on race-charges.From battles with Madonna over the "Material Girl" brand to fair use disputes with the Eagles' Don Henley to protecting such iconic brands as Bettie Page in trademark and trade dress disputes, Peter R. Afrasiabi primarily handles copyright, trademark, and entertainment disputes.

Unfortunately, the last few years has also seen a massive boom in litigation for businesses in this industry, as these new cannabusineses get snared in litigation and continue to fight federal laws.  Complicating matters, many states now have some form of marijuana regulation and each state is extremely different on how they regulate their cannabis programs.  And as we all know, marijuana remains illegal under federal law.

What are the key strategies to fully help your clients?

How To Avoid A Cultural Minefield In Your Law Practice



How To Avoid A Cultural Minefield In Your Law Practice
In both America and Canada, we have societies that have high rates of immigration.  With high rates of immigration comes groups of individuals that need legal services and support from the legal community - but at the same time bring along certain issues that need to be addressed to properly provide legal services to these individuals.  How can you avoid cultural minefields in your legal practice to fully and ethically represent all your clients?
To learn about the ways that you can avoid running into problems when dealing with cross-cultural issues please join attorney and linguist Suzanne Deliscar as she details how you can avoid key cultural minefields in your law practice.

Keep Calm and Drone On: Regulation and Liability



Keep Calm and Drone On: Regulation and Liability
Very soon our skies will be filled with drones.  Every year millions of drones are bought and put to use by businesses and individuals for everything from conducting surveillance and crop science to filming weddings, bar mitzvahs and other celebrations.  But what happens when the drone your 12 year-old son is flying loses contact with the controller causing it to crash into a local restaurant that then catches fire and is forced to shut down for 1 week?  Unfortunately, drones also have great potential to lead to liability for manufacturers, retailers, pilots... and parents!In this CLE course attorneys Eric Hanscom and Ed Burns provide an excellent discussion of the rise of drones and emerging areas of potential liability.  The main points of discussion include the many uses of drones, drone regulation, drone liability and best practices for legal claims.  Eric and Ed also address the mechanics of UAVs, FAA regulation, commercial vs. hobbyist use, the 333 exemption, local ordinances, flying on federal land, state vs. federal law, liability for those in the chain of commerce, negligence, drones & privacy rights, commercial uses for drones and key points to consider if you are faced with a drone claim.
Before beginning his own practice Eric Hanscom utilized his science background and law degree to gain experience in multiple facets of patent, trademark and copyright law and the application of those property rights.  He has been actively involved in overseeing litigation, contract negotiation and customs issues in the US, Asia, Europe, South American and Australia over matters ranging from patent and trademark infringement to breach of contract.  Edward W. Burns has extensive litigation experience in State and Federal Court and assists clients in protecting corporate intellectual property, including infringement litigation.  Mr. Burns also practices in the preparation, review and filing of corporate documents and filings, employment contracts, independent contractor agreements, and employee handbooks, business contracts, supply and production agreements, sponsorship agreements and leases.

Legal Challenges of Working with Breweries



Legal Challenges of Working with Breweries
With the emergence of Stone Brewing, Ballast Point and thousands of other craft brewers in every corner of the country, the American craft beer industry has exploded over the last decade.    Unfortunately, while these new craft brewers are experts when it comes to barley & hops, they are not experts when it comes to reviewing leases and establishing trademarks.  And often times these brewers are unaware of the most basic legal issues and they want to put all their time, money, effort and energy into making beer - not thinking about distribution agreements.In this CLE program, the craft beer attorney Candace Moon will teach you how to help your brewer clients start and run a solid business.  Candace discusses key legal issues for brewers including selecting the appropriate entity choice, staying compliant with securities law, reviewing agreements & leases, filing state and federal registrations & updates, protecting intellectual property and avoiding labor & employment issues.  The following topics are also covered: TTB (Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau) & state forms, entity protection for owners, changing entities, key points in lease review, distribution agreements, state & federal registrations, obtaining a trademark, banned words, independent contractor vs. employee designation, safety compliance, employment records, knowing your clients, the TTB licensing process & online forms and key questions to ask clients when they walk through your door.Candace L. Moon discovered the need for specialized craft beer counsel while working as a bartender at Hamilton's during law school. While she met countless brewers, there were no attorneys catering to the legally complicated industry. Accordingly, Candace opened a practice serving San Diego's suds. She has since worked with over 200 craft breweries and craft breweries-in-planning nationwide, handling business entity formation, alcoholic beverage law, contract review, trademark law, as well as other legal needs. Candace's undergraduate degree is from the University of Virginia and her juris doctorate is from Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, California.

Obtaining a Green Card Through Marriage



Obtaining a Green Card Through Marriage
Many of us know the plot of the romantic comedy Green Card starring G?rard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell.  In the movie, the two characters enter into a marriage of convenience so that the Frenchman can obtain a green card and remain in the U.S. and MacDowell?s character can rent the New York apartment of her dreams.  Unfortunately, there is much more that goes into getting a green card than simply marrying a U.S. citizen.
To learn more about obtaining permanent residency in the United States through marriage, join attorney Clare Corado as she forever spoils your love of romantic comedies.  Clare mainly describes the three main methods to obtain a green card ? adjustment of status, fianc? visa + adjustment of status and consular processing - and walks you through how you would apply for an adjustment of status for a client.  Further topics discussed include: the ?green card machine? fantasy, the reality of obtaining a green card, the ?bona fide? marriage, additional qualifications, same-sex couples, evidence of a bona fide marriage, marriage fraud indicators, legal standards, and the top 5 reasons an applicant doesn?t qualify for a green card.
Clare Corado is the founder of Corado Immigration Law, LLC, an Indianapolis based firm that focuses on helping mixed-nationality couples build their lives together in the United States.  Her work has been published in Legal Ink Magazine and she frequently speaks to attorneys and other professional and community groups on the topic of immigration law.

Psychology of the Jury: Conducting a Successful Voir Dire



Psychology of the Jury: Conducting a Successful Voir Dire
Jury selection is one aspect of trial practice that attorneys seem to fear the most and it is often an anxiety-provoking situation for both the attorney and potential juror.  One of the golden rules we all learn in law school is not to ask questions we don?t already know the answer to, especially during cross-examination. Well, in jury selection this rule does not apply. You don?t have any idea what anyone might say at any given time and this uncertainty creates a lot of anxiety and concern for many attorneys.
In this course trial consultant Bryan C. Edelman, Ph.D., uses his background in social psychology and the law to demystify the jury selection process and teach you how to better understand jurors and conduct a more effective voir dire. Dr. Edelman analyzes the courtroom experience from the perspective of the juror, provides tips & strategies for conducting a successful voir dire and teaches attorneys how to score jurors on important attributes so that they may more efficiently exercise peremptory challenges and select a jury.  Further topics of discussion include the story model, filters of human perception, personal experiences & jury deliberation, disconfirmation bias, obstacles to a successful voir dire, social pressure in the courtroom, comments from silent jurors, voir dire tactics, getting quiet jurors to talk, asking questions, identifying the pseudo-expert, the minimization effect in high profile cases, sculpting your audience, leadership, developing a scoring system, the wish list, the strike list, the scoring chart and the final review of your challenge decision.
Bryan C. Edelman, Ph.D., began working as a trial consultant in 1998. He has worked on numerous criminal and civil cases.  As a consultant, he applies his training in social psychology, persuasion, group dynamics and social cognition to the courtroom. His particular area of expertise is in complex litigation where jurors are most likely to rely on their prior attitudes, life experiences and heuristics to process evidence and reach conclusions. Dr. Edelman has served as a presenter at national and international conferences and has published a book on the impact of race and empathy on sentencing in capital cases and articles on the influence of graphic images on perceptions of liability and damages.

Securities Crowdfunding in the Age of Kickstarter



Securities Crowdfunding in the Age of Kickstarter
Crowdfunding has been the buzzword in the start-up world for years. But for most entrepreneurs, crowdfunding was almost as mythological as the sasquatch.  While it was possible to fund a business venture through donations by attracting numerous potential investors, there was no real medium to reach out to a wide audience.  Then came Kickstarter, GoFundeMe, IndieGoGo and a slew of other crowdfunding websites. Kickstarter alone has raised close to $2 billion for over 250,00 creative business projects.  However, new rules seek to protect small investors from unscrupulous operators and may dampen crowdfunding by limiting fundraising & advertising while adding new disclosure burdens.
In this CLE program, Crowdcheck CEO Sara Hanks explores the recent revisions to the crowdfunding laws and discusses the potential impacts on both companies and investors.  Among the key issues addressed in this course: Title III of the JOBS Act, what's changed under the revisions, investor limits, exemptions, safe harbors, 4(a)(6) intermediary requirements, prohibitions on funding portals, filing requirements & information, financial disclosures, publicity & advertising, bad actor checks, liability under 4(a)(6) and resale restrictions on securities.  Sara also provides numerous practical points for attorneys when counseling their clients on the positives and negatives of crowdfunding.
Sara Hanks, co-founder and CEO of CrowdCheck, is an attorney with over 30 years of experience in the corporate and securities field. Sara brings a wealth of legal expertise in securities law and start-ups to the emerging marketplace for crowdfunding and online capital formation.  Her position prior to founding CrowdCheck was General Counsel of the bipartisan Congressional Oversight Panel, the overseer of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), chaired by now-Senator Elizabeth Warren.  CrowdCheck provides due diligence, disclosure and compliance services for online capital formation, helping investors get the information they need to avoid fraud and make informed investment decisions, and helping entrepreneurs and intermediaries avoid liability.

The Phone Knows All: Cell Phones, CDR Reports and GPS Tracking for Attorneys



The Phone Knows All: Cell Phones, CDR Reports and GPS Tracking for Attorneys
In 1984, the dystopian novel by George Orwell, due to constant surveillance Big Brother knew your every move. In our new digital world, your cell phone might as well be Big Brother - it knows everything you do. Because cell phones now track your every movement, cell phone forensics and cellular data analysis is now widely used in criminal and civil cases to "place" a person at a particular location based on their cell phone usage.In this CLE course Robert Aguero, a cell phone forensics examiner, teaches you about utilizing data from cell phones and towers in your cases. Robert will address how CDR (Call Detail Reports) are used to track suspects, analyze several CDR reports, show you how to properly read and interpret CDR data & mistakes made by law enforcement in reading the data, discuss how phones can be tracked through the CDR report and detail how accurate or inaccurate that data can be. Additional topics discussed: how cell phone calls are made, MVNOs, what cell towers look like, the information that is available, using your CDR data, data & mobility usage and LTE data. Both civil and criminal must now be knowledgeable about cell phone data in order to effectively represent and advise their clients.Robert has been licensed as a private investigator in the State of California for 17 years. A former police officer and detective, he provides an unbiased, independent analysis of the data on cell phones and GPS units.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
