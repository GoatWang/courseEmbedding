A new Atlanta company is positioning itself to be a leader in Georgia's medical marijuana industry, before the industry even takes root.
Surterra Holdings Inc. is focused on the legalization of cannabis-based medicines and plans to help create a business infrastructure which will allow the production, distribution and sale of medical marijuana products in Georgia.

"We are trying to be very proactive in the early stages of helping make sure the legalization makes sense from a business standpoint," said Jake Bergmann, founder and CEO of Surterra. "By helping on the front side, we hope businesses that want to be involved in the industry would come to us because through our expertise and capital we can help them get set up and running."
Bergmann expects some form of a medical marijuana bill will pass during the 2015 Georgia General Assembly. He estimates it will cost between $60 million and $70 million to build out the industry's infrastructure.
Wes VanDyk, chief operating officer at Surterra, said the two spent a lot of time looking at different regulatory models in Colorado, California and other states that have legalized medical cannabis.





"We've done everything we can to research and develop a system that would make sense in southern states as we see this legalization process move across the country from a medicinal standpoint," VanDyk said. "We did a lot of boots-on-the-ground research in some of the more developed markets and looked at the existing political and business environments to identify viable companies to invest in or learn from as we saw the trend moving across the country from west to east."
Bergmann and VanDyk met Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, just before the first meeting of Georgia's medical cannabis study committee, which was created after last year's medical marijuana bill died in the General Assembly. That bill would have legalized use of certain kinds of marijuana, specifically cannabis oil, for children with seizures.
Peake on Nov. 17 prefiled a new proposed law, House Bill 1, which has been dubbed "The Haleigh's Hope Act." (To read it, visit http://bizj.us/1710it) It would grant Georgia families the right to use cannabis oil to treat certain seizure disorders in both children and adults.

Peake said Surterra appears to be very well funded and to have a very workable business model.
"They have provided some really good input on how to set up the business model and what works and what does not work in a potential piece of legislation," Peake said of Bergmann and VanDyk. "That's crucial and it's vitally important that we draft a bill that works in the real world. Because if all of a sudden we draft a bill, like Florida, where the rules and regulations become so burdensome and cumbersome that it's impossible to get the business off the ground and running so that citizens can have access to what the legislation intended, then we've failed."
Peake said there will be a limited number of medical cannabis licenses and a high bar will be set for potential licensees.




 


"Not just anybody can come off the street and all of a sudden grow marijuana," Peake said. "They're going to have a viable business model with a high standard of character and a business plan that is proven to be able to work."
Peake said he is looking at allotting five or six licenses for medical marijuana.
"Maybe that's five or six vertically integrated [businesses], or one or two that are vertically integrated with two or three growers, two or three processors and two or three distributors," Peake said. "We're trying to keep it small so there's not a burden on law enforcement to oversee it and provide security that's needed, and so there's not a big burden on the state bureaucracy to oversee the licensing process and the enforcement of the licensing process."
Christian Sederberg, a partner at the Denver-based law firm Vicente Sederberg LLC, which does marijuana work around the county, said Georgia could play an important role in the national medical marijuana movement because the proposed bill allows for higher amounts of the psychoactive drug THC. Marijuana contains another chemical known as cannabidiol, or CBD, which has additional medical effects
"This is a very tight and regulated system that is being proposed," Sederberg said. "It is a very patient-focused system and it addresses one of the big concerns in an interesting and new way, which is the 1:1 THC to CBD ratio as being a limit for THC."
According to a study conducted by Ethan Russo and published by an academic publishing company that publishes medical and scientific literature, Elsevier, the combination of THC and CBD increases clinical efficacy while reducing adverse events.
"The [Georgia] system is different in that it allows higher levels of THC than the CBD-only or very-low-THC type of bills, but it limits the upside of the amount of THC and really focuses more on medical products for patients," Sederberg said.
The General Assembly will convene on Jan. 12.

Even as the Texas Legislature debates a robust medical marijuana bill, the state's first foray into using weed as a health care treatment is moving closer to liftoff with three companies leading the way — one of which has already disclosed plans for a North Austin grow site and processing facility.
It will be the first private — and legal — weed-growing enterprise in a state known for being bullishly stand-offish about the plant.

Some Texans with epilepsy will soon be able to buy marijuana-derived cannabidiol (CBD) oil with extremely low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the hallucinogenic compound in marijuana. That means it will relieve pain but not produce a euphoric high.
Three companies received conditional approval May 1 from the Texas Department of Public Safety to participate in the Compassionate Use Program, dependent on follow-up inspections of their production facilities. All are licensed to "cultivate, extract and dispense" marijuana that is less than 0.5 percent THC by weight. They are:
Surterra Texas, part of a company that already produces low-THC medical marijuana in Florida — which has unveiled plans to grow the marijuana in the Austin area; Cansortium Texas, a subsidiary of a company that also operates in Florida; and Compassionate Cultivation.




A total of 43 companies applied, such as a joint venture that included a startup based at the Texas Medical Center in Houston.
The three recipients of the DPS licenses have a clear advantage in being the first to reach commercialization, which is a critical factor to success in any nascent industry. These pioneers of low-THC medical marijuana will also have an inside track to wider marijuana cultivation in Texas in case lawmakers ever relax the state's rules.
The low-THC CBD products permitted under the Compassionate Use Program are different from the CBD oil already available to Texas consumers. Unlike marijuana-derived CBD oil, hemp-derived CBD oil contains no more than 0.3 percent THC, said Sheila Hemphill, policy director of the Texas Hemp Industries Association. Go here for more background on the differences.

That confusion led DPS last fall to confiscate hemp-derived CBD products from Austin locations of Peoples Rx; the agency later decided not to pursue criminal charges.
Texas lawmakers approved the Compassionate Use Act in 2015, which legalized CBD from marijuana plants. However, it will only be available to people suffering from a rare form of epilepsy who have already tried at least two drugs to treat their condition. Proponents of medical marijuana criticize the Texas law as overly restrictive.




 


Pioneers of Texas medical marijuana
Surterra already has experience producing low-THC marijuana. Its holding company, Atlanta-based Surterra Holdings Inc., was the first company authorized to grow and sell such marijuana products in Florida — it has operated a production facility and dispensary in Tampa, Fla., since summer 2016.
"Surterra is an experienced medical cannabis producer, specifically low-THC cannabis, and we’re focused on natural alternatives to restore and empower people’s health when traditional pharmaceuticals have failed them," said Wes Van Dyk, president of Sulterra Texas and founder and chief development officer of Sulterra Holdings.
Surterra will deliver its products in Texas to homes and physician offices and already has a facility lined up in Austin to grow and cultivate plants, Van Dyk said. He declined to give its exact location but said it is about a 15-minute drive north of downtown. The facility will start with eight to 10 employees and grow as customer demand increases.
The state must finish its inspections of the low-THC marijuana production facilities by Sept. 1; Van Dyk hopes to have products ready for patients by Christmas.
Surterra's CBD oil could provide relief to thousands of Texans "who have nowhere else to turn," said Van Dyk, who is a native of Dallas.
Surterra has significant financial backing. The company has raised $15 million, the Atlanta Business Chronicle reported in December.
Led by CEO Jake Bergmann, Surterra is one of six companies approved in the state of Florida to cultivate, process and dispense low-THC cannabis and medical cannabis. It has plans to open other locations around the state. Read more about Surterra's efforts in Florida here and here.
The Atlanta Business Chronicle first reported about Surterra in 2014. Read that story here.

From Concept to Cultivator: How Surterra Therapeutics Launched Florida’s First Cannabis Farm

March 15, 2016 Louisa Burwood-Taylor 1 Comment



Last month, Surterra Therapeutics broke records to become the first fully licensed cannabis farm growing the plant in Florida. The medical cannabis cultivation, processing and dispensary company expects to sell its first products by June, well ahead of the 210-day rule from the Department of Health (DOH) and keeping it months ahead of any competition.
Surterra’s willingness to take on some risk by building its first facility — a 6,000 square foot indoor farm — before getting initial approval last November, is one of the main reasons it is the first to start growing cannabis after the DOH inspected the facility last month, according to Jake Bergman, founder and CEO of Surterra.
“We did a lot of preparation at the same time as pursuing a licence to prove we were serious about investing our time and efforts in building state of the art facilities; we wanted to prove we were ready to go,” he told AgFunderNews. “Many groups in Florida have not done that, but we thought it was the right thing to do, and in some ways it de-risked the selection process as we could show the department of health pictures of the facility under construction so that they knew we were professional players.”
Surterra formed when Bergman and his co-founders were researching various sectors for individual managed funds. Legal cannabis “kept cropping up” and they started researching the sector in 2013, according to Bergman. As they started doing due diligence, they found that the sector was still very disorganized and unprofessional. “We also felt that in the states where it was legal, everyone had overlooked the true medical benefits of cannabis production,” he said. “When you go to Colorado, it’s very much ‘wink wink, nod nod’ among those buying and selling cannabis products. We saw demand for conditions like epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease and cancer that no-one was addressing in a therapeutic fashion.”
Surterra is a vertically-integrated company, cultivating, processing and dispensing medical cannabis products into the market. And the company does all of this through one licence — this differs from other states that issue separate licences for each part of the chain.
There are still separate steps for each process, however, and Surterra was the first to obtain its cultivation approval. It’s now in the process of getting approval from processing and dispensing, which should go through around May or June.
Florida is only issuing five licenses, but these licences do not restrict how many facilities one company can operate. Surterra is about to open its second facility, a series of shipping container pods growing cannabis hydroponically. These containers will be fully climate controlled, with automated lighting, metered water, and seed to sale tracking. “It’s almost as automated as you can be,” said Wes Van Dyk, co-founder and chief operating officer.
The existing 6,000 square foot indoor farm, which is in Northern  Florida, is also climate controlled, but is hand watered, and the plants grow in soil rather than hydroponically. 
Surterra is using two different growing conditions as an A/B test to find out which is the most effective. To measure this, and also to ensure compliance with the law, the company uses tracking software. It’s about to transfer from one called Agrasoft to another called Priva.
This software will track every interaction with the plant: when a clone is made, when a plant is transferred, the exact amount of water or nutrients given, every interaction an employee has with a plant. This will produce monthly reports for the DOH, and enable any queries or complaints from patients to be addressed by tracking the product all the way through the supply chain to the individual plant.
At the facilities, Surterra engages in some simple processing to extract oils from the plants in a similar process to creating vanilla extract, according to Bergman. From there the company makes a range of products such as gel caps, a dropper solution, topical creams and trans-thermal patches. “It’s very important we provide patients with a variety of options so they can use whatever methods of administration work best for them,” he said. “We want this to be a patient-driven business.”
These products will also have tailored ingredients depending on the condition they’re addressing. For example, an epilepsy product will have no more than 0.8 percent THC, but 12 to 15 times more CBD, depending on the patient. The oil extracts are condensed down to these exact ratios through basic natural chemistry processes similar to cooking, according to Bergman. 
Surterra has raised funding over two rounds so far: a $800k seed round in the summer of 2014 involving friends and family and some high net worth individuals, and a $9 million Series A from existing investors and the corporate venture arm of a technology company in Atlanta, according to Bergman. While institutional investors interested in the cannabis sector have been few and far between, Surterra has had investment and interest from the owners and managers of investment management funds. 
“We’ve often found that the owner of a hedge fund and not the hedge fund itself makes the investment,” he said. And the few cannabis-focused investment funds around have yet to raise enough capital or be the right fit for Surterra at this point, he added.
“We are a medical company so need to ensure our investors have a similar profile and interest in the sector,” he said.
Surterra is currently raising a Series B round for over $35 million which Bergman hopes to close in the summer of this year, at a similar time to the opening of its first retail store.
Cannabis won’t be prescribed, but recommended by physicians; Surterra is currently engaging local physicians and will be holding an event with the Florida Medical Association in June. Cannabis products are currently not covered by insurance today.

The Endocannabinoid System
Utilizing your body’s natural healing systems
Understanding the endocannabinoid system’s significant role in promoting health and wellness
Just as fruits and vegetables contain vitamins and nutrients that aid the body, Cannabis contains naturally occurring chemical compounds called Cannabinoids, such as Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD), that have various positive effects on health and wellness. These Cannabinoids are extracted from oils secreted by the cannabis flowers and can be combined with other natural ingredients to provide patients with a safe, regulated relief system.

In Our Communities
“My son has had seizures every single day of his life, sometimes hundreds of seizures every day, since he was 3 weeks old. Seizures have sabotaged his ability to develop, so at five-years-old he cannot pull himself up, stand, talk, or walk. He has been on every conventional medicine, even veterinarian drugs, none of which have worked; but all of which come with a long list of horrific side effects. We should have a non-toxic plant extract available to us to help end his suffering."

ACCESSING PRODUCTS
How do I get started?
In order to ensure that patients in need find best and safest relief, the state of Florida requires patients to consult with a physician that has completed specific courses and training.
The following steps can help guide you through the process of locating a qualified physican that can help you to access the benefits of therapeutic cannabis relief. More questions? Feel free to call the Surterra Wellness line (850) 391-5455 to learn more.





STEP 1
90-day prior patient relationship with a qualified physician.

Find a Qualified Physician



STEP 2
Receive a qualified recommendation from your physician.

STEP 3
Visit a qualified dispensary with a valid state I.D.
