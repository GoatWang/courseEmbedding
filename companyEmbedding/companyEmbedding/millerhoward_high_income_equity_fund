Fund Risks
		The market price of equity securities may be affected by financial market, industry, or issuer-specific events. Focus on a particular style or on small or medium-sized companies may enhance that risk.
The Miller/Howard High Income Equity Fund is a closed-end fund traded on the New York Exchange (Symbol HIE). Shares must be purchased through a professional financial advisor.

There is no guarantee that the portfolio will meet its objective.

Shares of closed-end investment companies such as the Fund may trade in the market above, at, or below net asset value. This characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the
risk that the Fund’s net asset value could decline. The Fund is not able to predict whether its shares will trade above, below, or at net asset value in the future.

Leverage Risk. The use of leverage, which can be described as exposure to changes in price at a ratio greater than the amount of equity invested magnifies both the favorable and
unfavorable effects of price movements in the investments made by the Fund. The Fund’s use of leverage in its investment operations subjects it to substantial risk of loss.

Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. The prospectus contains this and additional information regarding the Fund. To obtain a prospectus, please download from this site or call 1-844-MHFUNDS. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.


An investment in the Miller/Howard Funds is subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Funds risks also include, but are not limited to, the following:

	
			Companies that issue dividend yielding equity securities are not required to continue to pay dividends on such stock. The Funds may be exposed to liquidity risk that effect the Funds' ability to sell particular securities or close call option positions at an advantageous price or in a timely manner. The Funds invest in small and medium size companies, which carry greater risk than with larger, more established companies.
		
	
			MLP entities are typically focused in the energy, natural resources and real estate sectors of the economy. A downturn in the energy, natural resources or real estate sectors of the economy could have an adverse impact on the Fund. Changes to current tax law and regulations could affect the treatment of distributions, including (but limited to) ordinary income, capital gains or return of contribution. The Funds are new with limited operating history and there can be no assurance that the Funds will grow to or maintain an economically viable size.		
		
	
			An investment in the Miller/Howard Income-Equity Fund is also subject to the following: Non-US markets may be smaller, less liquid and more volatile than the major markets in the United States and, as a result, Fund share values may be more volatile. Trading in non-US markets typically involves higher expense than trading in the United States. The Fund may have difficulties enforcing its legal or contractual rights in a foreign country. These additional risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in emerging market countries.
		
	
			An investment in the Miller/Howard Drill Bit to Burner Tip® Fund is subject to the following: The Fund's focus on the securities that are the beneficiaries of the North American energy value chain presents more risk than if it were more broadly diversified over additional industries and sectors of the economy. General problems of energy companies include volatile fluctuations in price and supply of energy fuels, international politics, terrorist attacks, reserve and depletion risk and reduced demand.

Morningstar® Sustainability Rating™ 

	
				The Morningstar® Sustainability Rating™ is intended to measure how well the issuing companies of the securities within a fund's portfolio are managing their environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") risks and opportunities relative to the fund's Morningstar® category peers. The Morningstar Sustainability Rating™ calculation is a two-step process. First, each fund with at least 50% of assets covered by a company-level ESG score from Sustainalytics8 receives a Morningstar Portfolio Sustainability Score.™
			
	
				The Morningstar® Portfolio Sustainability Score™ is an asset-weighted average of normalized company-level ESG scores with deductions made for controversial incidents by the issuing companies, such as environmental accidents, fraud, or discriminatory behavior.
			
	
				The Morningstar® Sustainability Rating™ is then assigned to all scored funds within Morningstar® Categories in which at least ten (10) funds receive a Portfolio Sustainability Score and is determined by each fund's rank within the following distribution:




High (highest 10%)
Above Average (next 22.5%)




Average (next 35%)
Below Average (next 22.5%) and




Low (lowest 10%)




	
				The Morningstar Sustainability Rating™ is depicted by globe icons where High equals 5 globes and Low equals 1 globe.
			
	
				A Sustainability Rating is assigned to any fund that has more than half of its underlying assets rated by Sustainalytics and is within a Morningstar Category with at least 10 scored funds; therefore, the rating it is not limited to funds with explicit sustainable or responsible investment mandates. Morningstar updates its Sustainability Ratings monthly. Portfolios receive a Morningstar Portfolio Sustainability Score and Sustainability Rating one month and six business days after their reported as-of date based on the most recent portfolio. As part of the evaluation process, Morningstar uses Sustainalytics' ESG scores from the same month as the portfolio as-of date.
			
	
				Please visit http://corporate1.morningstar.com/SustainableInvesting/ for more detailed information about the Morningstar Sustainability Rating™ and its calculation. 
			

Sustainability Score and Sustainability Rating as of March 31, 2017. Sustainalytics provides company-level analysis used in the calculation of Morningstar's® Sustainability Score. Sustainability Mandate information is derived from the fund prospectus.

Strategies / Strategy Summary 
										



Miller/Howard Investment Strategies


 





Income-Equity Strategies






There are two versions of the strategy:




Income-Equity Strategy with exchange-traded Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).
								

Income-Equity Strategy (No MLPs), which does not generate K-1 tax forms from MLPs.
								

 

Key features:




A multi-cap core portfolio of high-quality stocks
							focused on high current dividend income and dividend growth, composed of reliable companies from across the broad market.
								

Conservative stocks (average debt rating above investment grade) that are high yield and projected to have a rising stream of income.
								

Solid total returns that provide both income and growth, high current income that increases every year, and a lower federal tax rate on qualified dividends.							
								

 
 

 
 

MLP Strategy







A mid-large-cap portfolio primarily composed of high-quality pipelines and energy facilities with high annual distributions that we project will have strong prospects for growth of distributions. 
								

The portfolio comprises Master Limited Partnerships with long-life assets and projects as well as durable and stable business models that can generate substantial cash flow to provide attractive yields for the investor while allowing for long-term organic growth.
								Read more about the MLP Strategy.
								

 
 

 
 

Miller/Howard Infrastructure







A mid-large-cap portfolio of energy and utilities focusing on opportunities in the broad utilities sector: electric, gas, telephone, sanitation, water, and the suppliers that enable their transmission, operation, and growth.


Focused on opportunities in the broad, global utilities industry, this portfolio seeks to participate in the dynamic growth potential of the most important economic sector (essential services and infrastructure, worldwide).
								Read more about Miller/Howard Infrastructure.
							

 
 

 
 

Miller/Howard Utilities Plus







A mid-cap, opportunistic portfolio focused on distribution gas and electric utility companies that we believe are likely acquisition candidates.
							

Companies are conservative, largely regulated, old-style rate-of-return monopolies that pay and steadily grow dividends.
						Read more about Miller/Howard Utilities Plus.
							

 
 

 
 

Rising Dividend Plus







A large-cap core strategy invested in established and seasoned companies with high financial strength and high projected dividend growth.
							

Companies considered likely to provide steadily growing earnings and dividends. This fundamentally driven strategy utilizes momentum and technical analysis in the investment process.

High-Yield Equity







A high-yield equity portfolio invested in companies that have among the highest dividends in the market.
							

We created this strategy to produce the highest possible income from stocks with reasonable safety and without securities that generate K-1 reports. We expect stocks in this portfolio to continue to pay, and potentially raise, their dividends.					
							

Strategy is diversified by industry, quality, and financial strength.

Drill Bit to Burner Tip®







A single-themed, balanced equity strategy that takes advantage of diverse opportunities all along the natural gas value chain, including producers, processors, transporters, and users.
							

Rapid growth and expanding demand characterize this "bipartisan fuel," which is taking the place of coal as the best source of electric generation. Holdings provide steady and rising income, with numerous opportunities for capital appreciation.

Miller/Howard General Partners Strategy







Midstream energy with No K-1s. Midstream companies are the link between energy production and energy use. This strategy invests in exchange-traded General Partners that customarily hold interests in midstream energy limited partnerships but are not subject to K-1 tax forms.
							

Above market yields with superior income growth. Master Limited Partnerships' recent distribution growth has averaged 6%–8%. But GPs have raised their distributions faster than that by virtue of an astute business structure.				
							

Stable industry with excellent future opportunities . In our view, the surge in the country's natural gas output and recent approval of new export facilities present enormous opportunities for natural gas infrastructure to meet the needs of both domestic and offshore markets in the years to come.

Firm / Our History 
										



Our History
Miller/Howard Investments Inc. was founded in 1984 as an institutional research firm providing quantitative and technical research on large-capitalization stocks to clients such as Fidelity, CIGNA, USF&G, Delta Airlines, John Templeton, George Soros, Federal Express, and many others.* In 1989, while investigating alternatives to traditional fixed-income vehicles, we conducted a landmark study of the long-term returns of utilities as an asset class. Our research revealed the income-generating, wealth-building potential of dividends over the long term. Based on these findings, we began managing our first utilities portfolio in 1991 founded on our philosophy that internal compounding (high current dividend income plus dividend growth) is the key to building long-term wealth. We hold to the adage, “slow and steady wins the race.”

Founder Lowell Miller, a leading expert on utilities, energy, and listed infrastructure as well as broad market dividend-growth companies, has been a keynote speaker and member of many industry panels, has appeared on Louis Rukeyser's Wall $treet Week and Bloomberg TV, and is regularly quoted in the national financial media. The strong investment team we have built has more than 150 years of combined investment experience.
Our evolution has been significantly influenced by the results of our utility study and the concept of a repeating-business model. In May 1997, we initiated the Income-Equity Strategy, which expands that model to nearly all sectors of the market and emphasizes stable companies that have a high current yield, rising dividend, and that may contain a hidden “growth kicker” that's not built into the stock's price.
Miller/Howard continues to evolve with development of disciplined investment strategies that provide investors with various levels of current income and dividend growth generated by companies with real assets, such as MLPs, companies that provide essential services, and broad market, dividend-focused stocks.

ESG / Environmental Social Governance 
										



Environmental Social Governance

Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) is a commonly used phrase that describes the integration of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) criteria with financial standards when making investment decisions. Miller/Howard Investments Inc. believes, as do many others, that this integrated approach provides a framework for achieving better long-term investment returns while building sustainable global economies and markets.  Our first SRI strategy ("Better than Bonds", now Miller/Howard Infrastructure) debuted in 1991, giving us more than 25 years of experience unique among many asset managers.
		

We engage in rigorous analysis of companies using ESG criteria, establishing and maintaining individual company profiles both before and after investment.
		

Our initial, pre-investment ESG research involves an extensive process that utilizes exclusion and preference screens as well as case-by-case analysis. A company must pass this evaluation in order to be eligible for investment in our SRI portfolios. We view this layer of due diligence as an essential SRI risk-control measure.
		

Our second stage of research is conducted on all SRI holdings quarterly: We update the company profiles, looking for best practices on ESG markers (e.g. ethical, transparent governance and established principles of environmental stewardship). We use these profiles to monitor company progress on the markers, and to identify opportunities for commendation and engagement.
		
 
Our shareholder advocacy program is multi-faceted and goes beyond the profiling of companies: We participate in shareholder activism, carefully vote proxies, regularly publish a shareholder advocacy newsletter, and support organizations or managers leading shareholder resolutions whenever in alignment with our portfolio holdings and policies. (See our Proxy Policy, which explains how a client can obtain the voting history.)

The Fund's current indicated yield based on its closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on March 31, 2017 ($13.39) is 10.40%. The current indicated yield based on the Fund's net asset value per share ($13.19) is 10.55%. The Fund intends to pay monthly distributions to its shareholders.
Each quarter, the Board of Trustees reviews the amount of any potential distribution to shareholders. The Board of Trustees will monitor the Fund's distribution level. The Fund's distribution rate may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and projected market returns, Fund performance and other factors. There can be no assurance that an unanticipated change in market conditions or other unforeseen factors will not result in a change in the Fund's distribution rate at a future time. The distribution rate should not be considered the dividend yield or total return on an investment in the Fund. 
About the Fund
The Fund is managed by Miller/Howard Investments Inc., based in Woodstock, New York. As of December 31, 2016 the firm managed approximately $6.0 billion in assets. Miller/Howard Investments focuses on income-producing equities. The emphasis is on high-quality stocks with high yield and strong dividend growth offering investors the opportunity for capital appreciation, current income, and growth of income. The firm has managed portfolios for major institutions and individuals for over two decades.

							Overview						


ETF Objective
Janus SG Global Quality Income ETF (SGQI) seeks investment results that correspond generally, before fees and expenses, to the performance of the SGI Global Quality Income Index.
Client Commitment
An Equity ETF seeking to provide investors with a consistent income stream by selecting quality, high-yielding companies across the globe. In today’s low-yielding environment, this may serve as an important complement to fixed income, offering both a diversified source of income and growth potential.
Why Invest in the Fund


Equity Income Potential

The strategy seeks to invest in dividend-paying companies with yields above 4%, pursuing the best opportunities in global developed market equities.

Quality Counts

The strategy aims to provide a consistent income stream by selecting quality companies with the potential to sustain or grow dividend payouts by evaluating balance sheet strength, profitability and price stability.

Core Income Complement

This may serve as a diversifier in an income portfolio providing both a differentiated stream of income and growth potential – especially important given the scarcity of yield in today’s market.

									Returns quoted are past performance and do not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment returns and principal value will vary; there may be a gain or loss when shares are sold.
									Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns.
