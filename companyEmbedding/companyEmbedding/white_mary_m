Editorial Reviews


Children's Literature  -  Children's Literature
 A gripping and well-organized text and page design plus new photographs taken in and out of the water involve readers in the truth about this shark. For instance, the truth is that Great Whites aren't the largest living sharks and the text and pictures show the basking and the whale shark and a red crayon overlay indicates how sharks are measured in feet and meters. In addition, the double page spread is edged with a wavy dark blue sidebar explaining in contrasting white type some of the challenges of measuring a shark--do you measure snout to tail, fork of tail or tip of tail? Do you really include the tail? Throughout, the author indicates how scientists work (carefully, in steel cages), how they came to find out (sharks are sensitive to smell and electric currents; shark pups eat the late hatchers even before they leave their mother's womb), and what they don't know but are thinking about (why sharks rarely eat a whole person but take only a bite). Along with a wonder and respect for sharks, the author compels readers to consider why humans need sharks. As she did for the octopus, Cerullo makes the shark real and exciting to middle elementary readers with this well-constructed and lively presentation. Sources, web sites, glossary, index, and further reading included. 2000, Chronicle Books, Ages 7 to 11, $14.95. Reviewer: Susan Hepler


School Library Journal
Gr 3-6-This volume focuses on the work of marine biologists and their attempts to learn more about these creatures. Children will learn about shark anatomy, senses, eating habits, and their relationships with humans. Chapter headings follow the format indicated by the title: "The Truth Is-Great Whites Are Not Cold-Blooded Killers" or "-Great Whites Are Good Mothers." The book also contains unusual information such as how these fish are measured and photographed and why they are not able to survive in an aquarium. The attractive layout blends line drawings, full-color photographs, varied typefaces, and eye-catching graphics. Rotman's pictures are clear and informative. Both the bibliography and list of further reading are short but current, and lists of shark-friendly organizations and activities are also included. This title will be accessible to reluctant readers and is a must for most collections.-Nora Jane Natke, Hooked on Books, Hollywood, FL Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.|
