Early life[edit]
Peter Guber was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents, Sam Guber and Ruth Anshen, of Jewish descent, married in 1929. Sam Guber owned a junk business in Somerville, Massachusetts. As a child, Guber was noted as a “very smart, wired kid” by a childhood acquaintance. He attended John Ward Elementary School and Newton North High School.[3]:p. 61–62) Guber’s childhood included a love of the Boston Red Sox and Fenway Park, which foreshadowed his later participation in the group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers.[4]
Following high school graduation, Guber enrolled in the pre-law curriculum at Syracuse University. He played intramural football and rushed the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.[3]:p.62–63 Guber spent his junior year abroad at Syracuse's Florence, Italy campus. At Syracuse he met his future wife, Lynda Gellis.[3]:p.64
Guber enrolled at New York University, where he earned his J.D. and LL.M. law degrees, studying for his MBA at night.[3]:p.64 As he neared graduation in 1968, Guber accepted a position with Columbia Pictures, which was keen to recruit him, as a management trainee.[3]:p.64–65
Career[edit]
Columbia Pictures[edit]
Guber joined Columbia Pictures in 1968. At Columbia, Guber, an early proponent of computerization and entertainment technologies, began computerizing files on working actors and made available tape-recorded summaries of scripts for other executives to listen to while driving to work.[3]:p.68–69 A year after arriving at Columbia, Guber, having witnessed a demonstration of an early video cassette machine, published "The New Ballgame/The Cartridge Revolution," a "prescient" analysis of the changes to be wrought by home video technology, in the journal Cinema.[3]:p.69–70
Guber was transferred to the business affairs division.[3]:p.71 Guber paid to fly himself to Columbia's New York City office and successfully argued for his promotion to vice-president of creative affairs.[3]:p.71–72 Shortly thereafter Guber was named head of American production.[3]:p.73 In August 1973 he was promoted to vice-president of worldwide production. Steven Spielberg noted that he “used to go to (Guber’s) office at Columbia when (he) was just starting. (Guber) had an enormous chart on (his) wall with what every director in the world was planning that listed their pictures in development and planned for production.” It made a lasting impression on Spielberg.[5]
During his time at Columbia the studio released, among other films, Shampoo, Taxi Driver, Tommy, The Way We Were and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Upon leaving Columbia in 1975, Guber was given a three-year production deal with the studio.
Independent producer[edit]
Guber launched his career as an independent film producer with The Deep (1977), which became the second highest-grossing film of the year.[3]:p.86 Guber also bought the rights and served as executive producer for Midnight Express (1978). Produced by Alan Marshall and David Puttnam, the film earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. The National Association of Theater Owners named Guber Producer of the Year.
Casablanca Record and Filmworks[edit]
In 1976 Guber merged his company Filmworks with Casablanca Records, headed by Neil Bogart, to form Casablanca Record and Filmworks, Inc. Guber became chairman while Bogart remained President of the combined company. Their record operation included Kiss, Donna Summer, Captain and Tennille, The Village People, and George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic. It also released soundtracks such as Midnight Express, Endless Love, and Flashdance. During this period, Guber also produced several television shows and series, including Television and the Presidency (1984) with Theodore H. White, the 1985 documentary series Oceanquest for NBC, and the 1980 special Mysteries of the Sea for ABC.
PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and the Guber-Peters Company[edit]
In 1979, Guber formed PolyGram's motion picture and television division where he was Chairman of the Board and CEO. He sold his interest in PolyGram in 1983 and formed and served as co-owner of the Guber-Peters Company (GPC) along with producer Jon Peters.
Films on which Guber served as producer or executive producer have earned more than $3 billion in worldwide revenue and more than 50 Academy Award nominations, including four Best Picture nominations. Guber's producing credits include Rain Man, Batman, Gorillas in the Mist, The Color Purple, Innerspace, The Witches of Eastwick, Flashdance, Missing, Tango & Cash and An American Werewolf in London.
This period of Guber’s career was marked by sharp deal making which was often successful. With The Witches of Eastwick Guber was accused by producer Rob Cohen, who had originally approached Guber with the book, of having "bought the book out from under me" after negotiations had begun.[3]:p.136–7But Guber’s deal with Cohen allowed him to buy out the producer, and Cohen was advised that if he sued, he would lose.[3]:p.134
Sony Pictures[edit]
In 1988, GPC became a public company when they merged with game show production company Barris Industries and on September 7, 1989, Barris Industries was renamed Guber-Peters Entertainment Company.[6] On September 29, 1989, GPEC was acquired by Sony Corporation and Guber became chairman of the board and CEO of Columbia Pictures Entertainment (now Sony Pictures Entertainment). The sale was completed on November 9, 1989 a day after Sony acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment. During Guber's tenure at SPE, the company produced and distributed many prime time, half-hour comedy television series, with shows including Married... with Children, Designing Women, and Seinfeld (all launched prior to Guber's arrival), and Mad About You and The Nanny.
During Guber's tenure as chairman and CEO, SPE's Motion Picture Group achieved, over four years, an industry-best domestic box office market share, which averaged seventeen percent. During the same period, Sony Pictures led all competitors with 120 Academy Award nominations, the highest four-year total ever for a single company.[7] Some of SPE's motion picture credits at this time include Awakenings, Misery, Flatliners, Terminator 2, Boyz n the Hood, City Slickers, Basic Instinct, A League of Their Own, Single White Female, A River Runs Through It, A Few Good Men, Sleepless in Seattle, In the Line of Fire, Groundhog Day and Philadelphia.
Mandalay Entertainment[edit]
In 1995, Guber, as part of his severance agreement from Sony, formed Mandalay Entertainment as a joint venture with his former employer. The multimedia entertainment company has interests in motion pictures, television, sports entertainment and digital media.[8]
Mandalay Pictures[edit]
Mandalay Pictures, a division of Mandalay Entertainment Group, produces motion pictures for the global marketplace. Mandalay’s primary distributor relationship is through a first look deal with Universal Pictures.

Mandalay Television's Blood Crime, starring James Caan and Jonathan Schaech, was USA network's highest rated (Crime Friday) movie for 2002.
From best-selling author Nora Roberts, Peter Guber adapted a number of books into Lifetime movies.[13] More than 34 million viewers turned in to the first collection of four movies: Angels Fall, Blue Smoke, Carolina Moon and Montana Sky.[14]
Following the initial Nora Roberts' adaptations, Mandalay Television produced the Nora Roberts II Collection, with four more all-new original movies: Northern Lights, Midnight Bayou, High Noon and Tribute. The second collection was seen by over 49 million viewers, and Northern Lights was one of the top rated cable movies in 2009.[15] Mandalay Television completed the ninth installment in the franchise, Carnal Innocence, starring Gabrielle Anwar, which premiered on Lifetime in June 2011.[16]
Mandalay Sports Entertainment[edit]
Peter Guber serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors and is the Managing Partner of Mandalay Baseball LLC, which is a joint venture with ownership of the Los Angeles Dodgers that recently acquired the Triple-A affiliated Minor League Baseball franchise in Oklahoma City, and commencing with the 2015 baseball season, will become the Triple-A affiliate of the Dodgers.[17]
He also continues to serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors for Mandalay Baseball Properties, which has owned, operated and is currently divesting a national array of affiliated Minor League Baseball franchises and venues. Among the professional sports franchises that have been recently divested by Mandalay Baseball Properties are the Dayton Dragons, a Single-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds which broke the all-time North American professional sports record for consecutive sell outs in 2011 with 815 games encompassing 12 seasons, and in August 2014 was sold for the highest price ever paid for a Minor League Baseball franchise.[18]
Mandalay Baseball Properties continues to own and operate the Erie SeaWolves, a Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.
Mandalay Sports Media[edit]
In 2012, Guber and Mandalay Entertainment partnered with CAA Sports and Mike Tollin to create Mandalay Sports Media.[19] The sports media business creates, finances, and acquires operating businesses, intellectual property, and varied enterprises within the sports and media sectors, as well as develops sports-themed entertainment programming for distribution across film, television, mobile and digital.[20]
In October 2014, Mandalay Sports Media invested in and became the largest shareholder in OYO Sports, a “fan engagement” company that produces buildable mini-replicas of athletes from major professional sports leagues including the MLB, NFL, NHL and MLS, as well as some universities.[21]
Dick Clark Productions[edit]
In September, 2012, Peter Guber and Mandalay Entertainment joined a partnership which purchased Dick Clark Productions from Red Zone Capital Management.[22]
Their productions include specials like The Golden Globes, The American Music Awards, The Academy of Country Music Awards,New Year's Rockin' Eve, and reality show So You Think You Can Dance.[23]
Golden State Warriors[edit]
Peter Guber serves as the Co-Executive Chairman of the Golden State Warriors. As co-managing partner, he joined Joe Lacob as the driving forces behind the current ownership group’s NBA record-setting bid to purchase the Warriors in 2010.[24] The Warriors won the NBA Championships for the 2014-15 NBA season and 2016-17 NBA season.[25]
Consultant Marc Ganis said of the purchase, “This could be one of the most valuable teams in the NBA.”[26] The Golden State Warriors won the 2014 Sports Business Journal Award for Team of the Year, saying the team “continued a sharp trajectory in 2013 under owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber that produced strong, extensive on- and off-court gains,”[27]
Guber and Lacob agreed to buy 12 acres of land in San Francisco's Mission Bay neighborhood to build a privately financed new arena. The move would mark the Warrior’s return to a home arena in San Francisco (from Oakland) for the first time in more than four decades. Opening is targeted for the 2018-2019 season.[28]
Lacob said of Guber: "He cares more than any owner about the team, the image of the team and what the fans think."[29]
Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]
On March 27, 2012, Guber became an owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers as a Partner in Guggenheim Baseball Entertainment.[30] The Los Angeles Dodgers clinched the 2013 National League West Division Championship and played postseason baseball for the first time since 2009.[31]
Guber was persuaded to join the group purchasing the Dodgers by Magic Johnson. “Magic called and he said, ‘Come on, we’ve been so lucky together, we’ve been so good together, let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it,’ ” said Guber. So after meeting with Johnson, and others in the prospective ownership group, Guber decided to join the team that would make the $2.15 billion winning offer, which more than doubled the previous record price for a North American sports franchise.”[32]
Howard Nuchow, co-head of CAA Sports, described Guber’s contributions as attached to the entire baseball experience, "It's the notion Peter has that you have to entertain fans from the time they receive tickets in the mail until they drive home."[29]
Los Angeles Football Club[edit]
In October 2014, Peter Guber became the owner and executive chairman of Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC).[33] The ownership group includes entrepreneur Henry Nguyen, sports veteran Tom Penn, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Mia Hamm Garciaparra and Tony Robbins, among others. The new club is scheduled to debut in 2018 in a new soccer stadium in the greater Los Angeles area built specifically for the team.[34]
Author[edit]
Guber's most recent book, Tell To Win - Connect, Persuade, and Triumph with the Hidden Power of Story, became a #1 bestseller in The New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal. Fortune magazine chose Tell To Win as one of their "5 Business Books You Can Really Use." [35] "Peter Guber’s other books include Inside The Deep and The Los Angeles Times best-seller Shootout: Surviving Fame and (Mis)Fortune in Hollywood. Guber authored a cover piece for the Harvard Business Review,[36] and op-ed pieces for The New York Times.[37]

Guber is the Chair of the Founding Board of Advisors for the Center for Managing Enterprises in Media, Entertainment & Sports (MEMES) at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.[39] [40]
Of his course, Guber said, “"I wanted students to recognize the power of narrative," he said. "Storytelling is not frivolous entertainment. It's an inspirational and professional tool that can bring life into focus." [41]

Early life[edit]
Peter Guber was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents, Sam Guber and Ruth Anshen, of Jewish descent, married in 1929. Sam Guber owned a junk business in Somerville, Massachusetts. As a child, Guber was noted as a “very smart, wired kid” by a childhood acquaintance. He attended John Ward Elementary School and Newton North High School.[3]:p. 61–62) Guber’s childhood included a love of the Boston Red Sox and Fenway Park, which foreshadowed his later participation in the group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers.[4]
Following high school graduation, Guber enrolled in the pre-law curriculum at Syracuse University. He played intramural football and rushed the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.[3]:p.62–63 Guber spent his junior year abroad at Syracuse's Florence, Italy campus. At Syracuse he met his future wife, Lynda Gellis.[3]:p.64
Guber enrolled at New York University, where he earned his J.D. and LL.M. law degrees, studying for his MBA at night.[3]:p.64 As he neared graduation in 1968, Guber accepted a position with Columbia Pictures, which was keen to recruit him, as a management trainee.[3]:p.64–65
Career[edit]
Columbia Pictures[edit]
Guber joined Columbia Pictures in 1968. At Columbia, Guber, an early proponent of computerization and entertainment technologies, began computerizing files on working actors and made available tape-recorded summaries of scripts for other executives to listen to while driving to work.[3]:p.68–69 A year after arriving at Columbia, Guber, having witnessed a demonstration of an early video cassette machine, published "The New Ballgame/The Cartridge Revolution," a "prescient" analysis of the changes to be wrought by home video technology, in the journal Cinema.[3]:p.69–70
Guber was transferred to the business affairs division.[3]:p.71 Guber paid to fly himself to Columbia's New York City office and successfully argued for his promotion to vice-president of creative affairs.[3]:p.71–72 Shortly thereafter Guber was named head of American production.[3]:p.73 In August 1973 he was promoted to vice-president of worldwide production. Steven Spielberg noted that he “used to go to (Guber’s) office at Columbia when (he) was just starting. (Guber) had an enormous chart on (his) wall with what every director in the world was planning that listed their pictures in development and planned for production.” It made a lasting impression on Spielberg.[5]
During his time at Columbia the studio released, among other films, Shampoo, Taxi Driver, Tommy, The Way We Were and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Upon leaving Columbia in 1975, Guber was given a three-year production deal with the studio.
Independent producer[edit]
Guber launched his career as an independent film producer with The Deep (1977), which became the second highest-grossing film of the year.[3]:p.86 Guber also bought the rights and served as executive producer for Midnight Express (1978). Produced by Alan Marshall and David Puttnam, the film earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. The National Association of Theater Owners named Guber Producer of the Year.
Casablanca Record and Filmworks[edit]
In 1976 Guber merged his company Filmworks with Casablanca Records, headed by Neil Bogart, to form Casablanca Record and Filmworks, Inc. Guber became chairman while Bogart remained President of the combined company. Their record operation included Kiss, Donna Summer, Captain and Tennille, The Village People, and George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic. It also released soundtracks such as Midnight Express, Endless Love, and Flashdance. During this period, Guber also produced several television shows and series, including Television and the Presidency (1984) with Theodore H. White, the 1985 documentary series Oceanquest for NBC, and the 1980 special Mysteries of the Sea for ABC.
PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and the Guber-Peters Company[edit]
In 1979, Guber formed PolyGram's motion picture and television division where he was Chairman of the Board and CEO. He sold his interest in PolyGram in 1983 and formed and served as co-owner of the Guber-Peters Company (GPC) along with producer Jon Peters.
Films on which Guber served as producer or executive producer have earned more than $3 billion in worldwide revenue and more than 50 Academy Award nominations, including four Best Picture nominations. Guber's producing credits include Rain Man, Batman, Gorillas in the Mist, The Color Purple, Innerspace, The Witches of Eastwick, Flashdance, Missing, Tango & Cash and An American Werewolf in London.
This period of Guber’s career was marked by sharp deal making which was often successful. With The Witches of Eastwick Guber was accused by producer Rob Cohen, who had originally approached Guber with the book, of having "bought the book out from under me" after negotiations had begun.[3]:p.136–7But Guber’s deal with Cohen allowed him to buy out the producer, and Cohen was advised that if he sued, he would lose.[3]:p.134
Sony Pictures[edit]
In 1988, GPC became a public company when they merged with game show production company Barris Industries and on September 7, 1989, Barris Industries was renamed Guber-Peters Entertainment Company.[6] On September 29, 1989, GPEC was acquired by Sony Corporation and Guber became chairman of the board and CEO of Columbia Pictures Entertainment (now Sony Pictures Entertainment). The sale was completed on November 9, 1989 a day after Sony acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment. During Guber's tenure at SPE, the company produced and distributed many prime time, half-hour comedy television series, with shows including Married... with Children, Designing Women, and Seinfeld (all launched prior to Guber's arrival), and Mad About You and The Nanny.
During Guber's tenure as chairman and CEO, SPE's Motion Picture Group achieved, over four years, an industry-best domestic box office market share, which averaged seventeen percent. During the same period, Sony Pictures led all competitors with 120 Academy Award nominations, the highest four-year total ever for a single company.[7] Some of SPE's motion picture credits at this time include Awakenings, Misery, Flatliners, Terminator 2, Boyz n the Hood, City Slickers, Basic Instinct, A League of Their Own, Single White Female, A River Runs Through It, A Few Good Men, Sleepless in Seattle, In the Line of Fire, Groundhog Day and Philadelphia.
Mandalay Entertainment[edit]
In 1995, Guber, as part of his severance agreement from Sony, formed Mandalay Entertainment as a joint venture with his former employer. The multimedia entertainment company has interests in motion pictures, television, sports entertainment and digital media.[8]
Mandalay Pictures[edit]
Mandalay Pictures, a division of Mandalay Entertainment Group, produces motion pictures for the global marketplace. Mandalay’s primary distributor relationship is through a first look deal with Universal Pictures.

Mandalay Television's Blood Crime, starring James Caan and Jonathan Schaech, was USA network's highest rated (Crime Friday) movie for 2002.
From best-selling author Nora Roberts, Peter Guber adapted a number of books into Lifetime movies.[13] More than 34 million viewers turned in to the first collection of four movies: Angels Fall, Blue Smoke, Carolina Moon and Montana Sky.[14]
Following the initial Nora Roberts' adaptations, Mandalay Television produced the Nora Roberts II Collection, with four more all-new original movies: Northern Lights, Midnight Bayou, High Noon and Tribute. The second collection was seen by over 49 million viewers, and Northern Lights was one of the top rated cable movies in 2009.[15] Mandalay Television completed the ninth installment in the franchise, Carnal Innocence, starring Gabrielle Anwar, which premiered on Lifetime in June 2011.[16]
Mandalay Sports Entertainment[edit]
Peter Guber serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors and is the Managing Partner of Mandalay Baseball LLC, which is a joint venture with ownership of the Los Angeles Dodgers that recently acquired the Triple-A affiliated Minor League Baseball franchise in Oklahoma City, and commencing with the 2015 baseball season, will become the Triple-A affiliate of the Dodgers.[17]
He also continues to serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors for Mandalay Baseball Properties, which has owned, operated and is currently divesting a national array of affiliated Minor League Baseball franchises and venues. Among the professional sports franchises that have been recently divested by Mandalay Baseball Properties are the Dayton Dragons, a Single-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds which broke the all-time North American professional sports record for consecutive sell outs in 2011 with 815 games encompassing 12 seasons, and in August 2014 was sold for the highest price ever paid for a Minor League Baseball franchise.[18]
Mandalay Baseball Properties continues to own and operate the Erie SeaWolves, a Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.
Mandalay Sports Media[edit]
In 2012, Guber and Mandalay Entertainment partnered with CAA Sports and Mike Tollin to create Mandalay Sports Media.[19] The sports media business creates, finances, and acquires operating businesses, intellectual property, and varied enterprises within the sports and media sectors, as well as develops sports-themed entertainment programming for distribution across film, television, mobile and digital.[20]
In October 2014, Mandalay Sports Media invested in and became the largest shareholder in OYO Sports, a “fan engagement” company that produces buildable mini-replicas of athletes from major professional sports leagues including the MLB, NFL, NHL and MLS, as well as some universities.[21]
Dick Clark Productions[edit]
In September, 2012, Peter Guber and Mandalay Entertainment joined a partnership which purchased Dick Clark Productions from Red Zone Capital Management.[22]
Their productions include specials like The Golden Globes, The American Music Awards, The Academy of Country Music Awards,New Year's Rockin' Eve, and reality show So You Think You Can Dance.[23]
Golden State Warriors[edit]
Peter Guber serves as the Co-Executive Chairman of the Golden State Warriors. As co-managing partner, he joined Joe Lacob as the driving forces behind the current ownership group’s NBA record-setting bid to purchase the Warriors in 2010.[24] The Warriors won the NBA Championships for the 2014-15 NBA season and 2016-17 NBA season.[25]
Consultant Marc Ganis said of the purchase, “This could be one of the most valuable teams in the NBA.”[26] The Golden State Warriors won the 2014 Sports Business Journal Award for Team of the Year, saying the team “continued a sharp trajectory in 2013 under owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber that produced strong, extensive on- and off-court gains,”[27]
Guber and Lacob agreed to buy 12 acres of land in San Francisco's Mission Bay neighborhood to build a privately financed new arena. The move would mark the Warrior’s return to a home arena in San Francisco (from Oakland) for the first time in more than four decades. Opening is targeted for the 2018-2019 season.[28]
Lacob said of Guber: "He cares more than any owner about the team, the image of the team and what the fans think."[29]
Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]
On March 27, 2012, Guber became an owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers as a Partner in Guggenheim Baseball Entertainment.[30] The Los Angeles Dodgers clinched the 2013 National League West Division Championship and played postseason baseball for the first time since 2009.[31]
Guber was persuaded to join the group purchasing the Dodgers by Magic Johnson. “Magic called and he said, ‘Come on, we’ve been so lucky together, we’ve been so good together, let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it,’ ” said Guber. So after meeting with Johnson, and others in the prospective ownership group, Guber decided to join the team that would make the $2.15 billion winning offer, which more than doubled the previous record price for a North American sports franchise.”[32]
Howard Nuchow, co-head of CAA Sports, described Guber’s contributions as attached to the entire baseball experience, "It's the notion Peter has that you have to entertain fans from the time they receive tickets in the mail until they drive home."[29]
Los Angeles Football Club[edit]
In October 2014, Peter Guber became the owner and executive chairman of Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC).[33] The ownership group includes entrepreneur Henry Nguyen, sports veteran Tom Penn, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Mia Hamm Garciaparra and Tony Robbins, among others. The new club is scheduled to debut in 2018 in a new soccer stadium in the greater Los Angeles area built specifically for the team.[34]
Author[edit]
Guber's most recent book, Tell To Win - Connect, Persuade, and Triumph with the Hidden Power of Story, became a #1 bestseller in The New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal. Fortune magazine chose Tell To Win as one of their "5 Business Books You Can Really Use." [35] "Peter Guber’s other books include Inside The Deep and The Los Angeles Times best-seller Shootout: Surviving Fame and (Mis)Fortune in Hollywood. Guber authored a cover piece for the Harvard Business Review,[36] and op-ed pieces for The New York Times.[37]
Professor[edit]
Peter Guber is a professor at the UCLA School of Theater, Film, Television and Digital Media and has been a member of the faculty for over 30 years. He also teaches at UCLA's Anderson School of Management.[38]

Guber is the Chair of the Founding Board of Advisors for the Center for Managing Enterprises in Media, Entertainment & Sports (MEMES) at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.[39] [40]
Of his course, Guber said, “"I wanted students to recognize the power of narrative," he said. "Storytelling is not frivolous entertainment. It's an inspirational and professional tool that can bring life into focus." [41]
Speaker[edit]
In 2012, Guber was named one of the “Twelve Great Speakers of the Year” by Successful Meetings magazine.[42] Guber’s national and global speaking events include Cisco, JWT, Under Armour, Alcoa, HSBC, Twitter, Sodexo, Milken Institute, Intel, Korn Ferry, Women's Wear Daily CEO Summit, Wharton Leadership Conference, GAP, Inc, John Hancock Life Insurance, Experian Marketing, Del Monte Foods, Cox Media Group, Comcast.[43]

Early life[edit]
Peter Guber was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents, Sam Guber and Ruth Anshen, of Jewish descent, married in 1929. Sam Guber owned a junk business in Somerville, Massachusetts. As a child, Guber was noted as a “very smart, wired kid” by a childhood acquaintance. He attended John Ward Elementary School and Newton North High School.[3]:p. 61–62) Guber’s childhood included a love of the Boston Red Sox and Fenway Park, which foreshadowed his later participation in the group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers.[4]
Following high school graduation, Guber enrolled in the pre-law curriculum at Syracuse University. He played intramural football and rushed the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.[3]:p.62–63 Guber spent his junior year abroad at Syracuse's Florence, Italy campus. At Syracuse he met his future wife, Lynda Gellis.[3]:p.64
Guber enrolled at New York University, where he earned his J.D. and LL.M. law degrees, studying for his MBA at night.[3]:p.64 As he neared graduation in 1968, Guber accepted a position with Columbia Pictures, which was keen to recruit him, as a management trainee.[3]:p.64–65
Career[edit]
Columbia Pictures[edit]
Guber joined Columbia Pictures in 1968. At Columbia, Guber, an early proponent of computerization and entertainment technologies, began computerizing files on working actors and made available tape-recorded summaries of scripts for other executives to listen to while driving to work.[3]:p.68–69 A year after arriving at Columbia, Guber, having witnessed a demonstration of an early video cassette machine, published "The New Ballgame/The Cartridge Revolution," a "prescient" analysis of the changes to be wrought by home video technology, in the journal Cinema.[3]:p.69–70
Guber was transferred to the business affairs division.[3]:p.71 Guber paid to fly himself to Columbia's New York City office and successfully argued for his promotion to vice-president of creative affairs.[3]:p.71–72 Shortly thereafter Guber was named head of American production.[3]:p.73 In August 1973 he was promoted to vice-president of worldwide production. Steven Spielberg noted that he “used to go to (Guber’s) office at Columbia when (he) was just starting. (Guber) had an enormous chart on (his) wall with what every director in the world was planning that listed their pictures in development and planned for production.” It made a lasting impression on Spielberg.[5]
During his time at Columbia the studio released, among other films, Shampoo, Taxi Driver, Tommy, The Way We Were and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Upon leaving Columbia in 1975, Guber was given a three-year production deal with the studio.
Independent producer[edit]
Guber launched his career as an independent film producer with The Deep (1977), which became the second highest-grossing film of the year.[3]:p.86 Guber also bought the rights and served as executive producer for Midnight Express (1978). Produced by Alan Marshall and David Puttnam, the film earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. The National Association of Theater Owners named Guber Producer of the Year.
Casablanca Record and Filmworks[edit]
In 1976 Guber merged his company Filmworks with Casablanca Records, headed by Neil Bogart, to form Casablanca Record and Filmworks, Inc. Guber became chairman while Bogart remained President of the combined company. Their record operation included Kiss, Donna Summer, Captain and Tennille, The Village People, and George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic. It also released soundtracks such as Midnight Express, Endless Love, and Flashdance. During this period, Guber also produced several television shows and series, including Television and the Presidency (1984) with Theodore H. White, the 1985 documentary series Oceanquest for NBC, and the 1980 special Mysteries of the Sea for ABC.
PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and the Guber-Peters Company[edit]
In 1979, Guber formed PolyGram's motion picture and television division where he was Chairman of the Board and CEO. He sold his interest in PolyGram in 1983 and formed and served as co-owner of the Guber-Peters Company (GPC) along with producer Jon Peters.
Films on which Guber served as producer or executive producer have earned more than $3 billion in worldwide revenue and more than 50 Academy Award nominations, including four Best Picture nominations. Guber's producing credits include Rain Man, Batman, Gorillas in the Mist, The Color Purple, Innerspace, The Witches of Eastwick, Flashdance, Missing, Tango & Cash and An American Werewolf in London.
This period of Guber’s career was marked by sharp deal making which was often successful. With The Witches of Eastwick Guber was accused by producer Rob Cohen, who had originally approached Guber with the book, of having "bought the book out from under me" after negotiations had begun.[3]:p.136–7But Guber’s deal with Cohen allowed him to buy out the producer, and Cohen was advised that if he sued, he would lose.[3]:p.134
Sony Pictures[edit]
In 1988, GPC became a public company when they merged with game show production company Barris Industries and on September 7, 1989, Barris Industries was renamed Guber-Peters Entertainment Company.[6] On September 29, 1989, GPEC was acquired by Sony Corporation and Guber became chairman of the board and CEO of Columbia Pictures Entertainment (now Sony Pictures Entertainment). The sale was completed on November 9, 1989 a day after Sony acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment. During Guber's tenure at SPE, the company produced and distributed many prime time, half-hour comedy television series, with shows including Married... with Children, Designing Women, and Seinfeld (all launched prior to Guber's arrival), and Mad About You and The Nanny.
During Guber's tenure as chairman and CEO, SPE's Motion Picture Group achieved, over four years, an industry-best domestic box office market share, which averaged seventeen percent. During the same period, Sony Pictures led all competitors with 120 Academy Award nominations, the highest four-year total ever for a single company.[7] Some of SPE's motion picture credits at this time include Awakenings, Misery, Flatliners, Terminator 2, Boyz n the Hood, City Slickers, Basic Instinct, A League of Their Own, Single White Female, A River Runs Through It, A Few Good Men, Sleepless in Seattle, In the Line of Fire, Groundhog Day and Philadelphia.
Mandalay Entertainment[edit]
In 1995, Guber, as part of his severance agreement from Sony, formed Mandalay Entertainment as a joint venture with his former employer. The multimedia entertainment company has interests in motion pictures, television, sports entertainment and digital media.[8]
Mandalay Pictures[edit]
Mandalay Pictures, a division of Mandalay Entertainment Group, produces motion pictures for the global marketplace. Mandalay’s primary distributor relationship is through a first look deal with Universal Pictures.

Mandalay Television's Blood Crime, starring James Caan and Jonathan Schaech, was USA network's highest rated (Crime Friday) movie for 2002.
From best-selling author Nora Roberts, Peter Guber adapted a number of books into Lifetime movies.[13] More than 34 million viewers turned in to the first collection of four movies: Angels Fall, Blue Smoke, Carolina Moon and Montana Sky.[14]
Following the initial Nora Roberts' adaptations, Mandalay Television produced the Nora Roberts II Collection, with four more all-new original movies: Northern Lights, Midnight Bayou, High Noon and Tribute. The second collection was seen by over 49 million viewers, and Northern Lights was one of the top rated cable movies in 2009.[15] Mandalay Television completed the ninth installment in the franchise, Carnal Innocence, starring Gabrielle Anwar, which premiered on Lifetime in June 2011.[16]
Mandalay Sports Entertainment[edit]
Peter Guber serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors and is the Managing Partner of Mandalay Baseball LLC, which is a joint venture with ownership of the Los Angeles Dodgers that recently acquired the Triple-A affiliated Minor League Baseball franchise in Oklahoma City, and commencing with the 2015 baseball season, will become the Triple-A affiliate of the Dodgers.[17]
He also continues to serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors for Mandalay Baseball Properties, which has owned, operated and is currently divesting a national array of affiliated Minor League Baseball franchises and venues. Among the professional sports franchises that have been recently divested by Mandalay Baseball Properties are the Dayton Dragons, a Single-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds which broke the all-time North American professional sports record for consecutive sell outs in 2011 with 815 games encompassing 12 seasons, and in August 2014 was sold for the highest price ever paid for a Minor League Baseball franchise.[18]
Mandalay Baseball Properties continues to own and operate the Erie SeaWolves, a Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.
Mandalay Sports Media[edit]
In 2012, Guber and Mandalay Entertainment partnered with CAA Sports and Mike Tollin to create Mandalay Sports Media.[19] The sports media business creates, finances, and acquires operating businesses, intellectual property, and varied enterprises within the sports and media sectors, as well as develops sports-themed entertainment programming for distribution across film, television, mobile and digital.[20]
In October 2014, Mandalay Sports Media invested in and became the largest shareholder in OYO Sports, a “fan engagement” company that produces buildable mini-replicas of athletes from major professional sports leagues including the MLB, NFL, NHL and MLS, as well as some universities.[21]
Dick Clark Productions[edit]
In September, 2012, Peter Guber and Mandalay Entertainment joined a partnership which purchased Dick Clark Productions from Red Zone Capital Management.[22]
Their productions include specials like The Golden Globes, The American Music Awards, The Academy of Country Music Awards,New Year's Rockin' Eve, and reality show So You Think You Can Dance.[23]
Golden State Warriors[edit]
Peter Guber serves as the Co-Executive Chairman of the Golden State Warriors. As co-managing partner, he joined Joe Lacob as the driving forces behind the current ownership group’s NBA record-setting bid to purchase the Warriors in 2010.[24] The Warriors won the NBA Championships for the 2014-15 NBA season and 2016-17 NBA season.[25]
Consultant Marc Ganis said of the purchase, “This could be one of the most valuable teams in the NBA.”[26] The Golden State Warriors won the 2014 Sports Business Journal Award for Team of the Year, saying the team “continued a sharp trajectory in 2013 under owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber that produced strong, extensive on- and off-court gains,”[27]
Guber and Lacob agreed to buy 12 acres of land in San Francisco's Mission Bay neighborhood to build a privately financed new arena. The move would mark the Warrior’s return to a home arena in San Francisco (from Oakland) for the first time in more than four decades. Opening is targeted for the 2018-2019 season.[28]
Lacob said of Guber: "He cares more than any owner about the team, the image of the team and what the fans think."[29]
Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]
On March 27, 2012, Guber became an owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers as a Partner in Guggenheim Baseball Entertainment.[30] The Los Angeles Dodgers clinched the 2013 National League West Division Championship and played postseason baseball for the first time since 2009.[31]
Guber was persuaded to join the group purchasing the Dodgers by Magic Johnson. “Magic called and he said, ‘Come on, we’ve been so lucky together, we’ve been so good together, let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it,’ ” said Guber. So after meeting with Johnson, and others in the prospective ownership group, Guber decided to join the team that would make the $2.15 billion winning offer, which more than doubled the previous record price for a North American sports franchise.”[32]
Howard Nuchow, co-head of CAA Sports, described Guber’s contributions as attached to the entire baseball experience, "It's the notion Peter has that you have to entertain fans from the time they receive tickets in the mail until they drive home."[29]
Los Angeles Football Club[edit]
In October 2014, Peter Guber became the owner and executive chairman of Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC).[33] The ownership group includes entrepreneur Henry Nguyen, sports veteran Tom Penn, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Mia Hamm Garciaparra and Tony Robbins, among others. The new club is scheduled to debut in 2018 in a new soccer stadium in the greater Los Angeles area built specifically for the team.[34]
Author[edit]
Guber's most recent book, Tell To Win - Connect, Persuade, and Triumph with the Hidden Power of Story, became a #1 bestseller in The New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal. Fortune magazine chose Tell To Win as one of their "5 Business Books You Can Really Use." [35] "Peter Guber’s other books include Inside The Deep and The Los Angeles Times best-seller Shootout: Surviving Fame and (Mis)Fortune in Hollywood. Guber authored a cover piece for the Harvard Business Review,[36] and op-ed pieces for The New York Times.[37]

Guber is the Chair of the Founding Board of Advisors for the Center for Managing Enterprises in Media, Entertainment & Sports (MEMES) at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.[39] [40]
Of his course, Guber said, “"I wanted students to recognize the power of narrative," he said. "Storytelling is not frivolous entertainment. It's an inspirational and professional tool that can bring life into focus." [41]

Early life[edit]
Peter Guber was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents, Sam Guber and Ruth Anshen, of Jewish descent, married in 1929. Sam Guber owned a junk business in Somerville, Massachusetts. As a child, Guber was noted as a “very smart, wired kid” by a childhood acquaintance. He attended John Ward Elementary School and Newton North High School.[3]:p. 61–62) Guber’s childhood included a love of the Boston Red Sox and Fenway Park, which foreshadowed his later participation in the group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers.[4]
Following high school graduation, Guber enrolled in the pre-law curriculum at Syracuse University. He played intramural football and rushed the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.[3]:p.62–63 Guber spent his junior year abroad at Syracuse's Florence, Italy campus. At Syracuse he met his future wife, Lynda Gellis.[3]:p.64
Guber enrolled at New York University, where he earned his J.D. and LL.M. law degrees, studying for his MBA at night.[3]:p.64 As he neared graduation in 1968, Guber accepted a position with Columbia Pictures, which was keen to recruit him, as a management trainee.[3]:p.64–65
Career[edit]
Columbia Pictures[edit]
Guber joined Columbia Pictures in 1968. At Columbia, Guber, an early proponent of computerization and entertainment technologies, began computerizing files on working actors and made available tape-recorded summaries of scripts for other executives to listen to while driving to work.[3]:p.68–69 A year after arriving at Columbia, Guber, having witnessed a demonstration of an early video cassette machine, published "The New Ballgame/The Cartridge Revolution," a "prescient" analysis of the changes to be wrought by home video technology, in the journal Cinema.[3]:p.69–70
Guber was transferred to the business affairs division.[3]:p.71 Guber paid to fly himself to Columbia's New York City office and successfully argued for his promotion to vice-president of creative affairs.[3]:p.71–72 Shortly thereafter Guber was named head of American production.[3]:p.73 In August 1973 he was promoted to vice-president of worldwide production. Steven Spielberg noted that he “used to go to (Guber’s) office at Columbia when (he) was just starting. (Guber) had an enormous chart on (his) wall with what every director in the world was planning that listed their pictures in development and planned for production.” It made a lasting impression on Spielberg.[5]
During his time at Columbia the studio released, among other films, Shampoo, Taxi Driver, Tommy, The Way We Were and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Upon leaving Columbia in 1975, Guber was given a three-year production deal with the studio.
Independent producer[edit]
Guber launched his career as an independent film producer with The Deep (1977), which became the second highest-grossing film of the year.[3]:p.86 Guber also bought the rights and served as executive producer for Midnight Express (1978). Produced by Alan Marshall and David Puttnam, the film earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. The National Association of Theater Owners named Guber Producer of the Year.
Casablanca Record and Filmworks[edit]
In 1976 Guber merged his company Filmworks with Casablanca Records, headed by Neil Bogart, to form Casablanca Record and Filmworks, Inc. Guber became chairman while Bogart remained President of the combined company. Their record operation included Kiss, Donna Summer, Captain and Tennille, The Village People, and George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic. It also released soundtracks such as Midnight Express, Endless Love, and Flashdance. During this period, Guber also produced several television shows and series, including Television and the Presidency (1984) with Theodore H. White, the 1985 documentary series Oceanquest for NBC, and the 1980 special Mysteries of the Sea for ABC.
PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and the Guber-Peters Company[edit]
In 1979, Guber formed PolyGram's motion picture and television division where he was Chairman of the Board and CEO. He sold his interest in PolyGram in 1983 and formed and served as co-owner of the Guber-Peters Company (GPC) along with producer Jon Peters.
Films on which Guber served as producer or executive producer have earned more than $3 billion in worldwide revenue and more than 50 Academy Award nominations, including four Best Picture nominations. Guber's producing credits include Rain Man, Batman, Gorillas in the Mist, The Color Purple, Innerspace, The Witches of Eastwick, Flashdance, Missing, Tango & Cash and An American Werewolf in London.
This period of Guber’s career was marked by sharp deal making which was often successful. With The Witches of Eastwick Guber was accused by producer Rob Cohen, who had originally approached Guber with the book, of having "bought the book out from under me" after negotiations had begun.[3]:p.136–7But Guber’s deal with Cohen allowed him to buy out the producer, and Cohen was advised that if he sued, he would lose.[3]:p.134
Sony Pictures[edit]
In 1988, GPC became a public company when they merged with game show production company Barris Industries and on September 7, 1989, Barris Industries was renamed Guber-Peters Entertainment Company.[6] On September 29, 1989, GPEC was acquired by Sony Corporation and Guber became chairman of the board and CEO of Columbia Pictures Entertainment (now Sony Pictures Entertainment). The sale was completed on November 9, 1989 a day after Sony acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment. During Guber's tenure at SPE, the company produced and distributed many prime time, half-hour comedy television series, with shows including Married... with Children, Designing Women, and Seinfeld (all launched prior to Guber's arrival), and Mad About You and The Nanny.
During Guber's tenure as chairman and CEO, SPE's Motion Picture Group achieved, over four years, an industry-best domestic box office market share, which averaged seventeen percent. During the same period, Sony Pictures led all competitors with 120 Academy Award nominations, the highest four-year total ever for a single company.[7] Some of SPE's motion picture credits at this time include Awakenings, Misery, Flatliners, Terminator 2, Boyz n the Hood, City Slickers, Basic Instinct, A League of Their Own, Single White Female, A River Runs Through It, A Few Good Men, Sleepless in Seattle, In the Line of Fire, Groundhog Day and Philadelphia.
Mandalay Entertainment[edit]
In 1995, Guber, as part of his severance agreement from Sony, formed Mandalay Entertainment as a joint venture with his former employer. The multimedia entertainment company has interests in motion pictures, television, sports entertainment and digital media.[8]
Mandalay Pictures[edit]
Mandalay Pictures, a division of Mandalay Entertainment Group, produces motion pictures for the global marketplace. Mandalay’s primary distributor relationship is through a first look deal with Universal Pictures.

Mandalay Television's Blood Crime, starring James Caan and Jonathan Schaech, was USA network's highest rated (Crime Friday) movie for 2002.
From best-selling author Nora Roberts, Peter Guber adapted a number of books into Lifetime movies.[13] More than 34 million viewers turned in to the first collection of four movies: Angels Fall, Blue Smoke, Carolina Moon and Montana Sky.[14]
Following the initial Nora Roberts' adaptations, Mandalay Television produced the Nora Roberts II Collection, with four more all-new original movies: Northern Lights, Midnight Bayou, High Noon and Tribute. The second collection was seen by over 49 million viewers, and Northern Lights was one of the top rated cable movies in 2009.[15] Mandalay Television completed the ninth installment in the franchise, Carnal Innocence, starring Gabrielle Anwar, which premiered on Lifetime in June 2011.[16]
Mandalay Sports Entertainment[edit]
Peter Guber serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors and is the Managing Partner of Mandalay Baseball LLC, which is a joint venture with ownership of the Los Angeles Dodgers that recently acquired the Triple-A affiliated Minor League Baseball franchise in Oklahoma City, and commencing with the 2015 baseball season, will become the Triple-A affiliate of the Dodgers.[17]
He also continues to serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors for Mandalay Baseball Properties, which has owned, operated and is currently divesting a national array of affiliated Minor League Baseball franchises and venues. Among the professional sports franchises that have been recently divested by Mandalay Baseball Properties are the Dayton Dragons, a Single-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds which broke the all-time North American professional sports record for consecutive sell outs in 2011 with 815 games encompassing 12 seasons, and in August 2014 was sold for the highest price ever paid for a Minor League Baseball franchise.[18]
Mandalay Baseball Properties continues to own and operate the Erie SeaWolves, a Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.
Mandalay Sports Media[edit]
In 2012, Guber and Mandalay Entertainment partnered with CAA Sports and Mike Tollin to create Mandalay Sports Media.[19] The sports media business creates, finances, and acquires operating businesses, intellectual property, and varied enterprises within the sports and media sectors, as well as develops sports-themed entertainment programming for distribution across film, television, mobile and digital.[20]
In October 2014, Mandalay Sports Media invested in and became the largest shareholder in OYO Sports, a “fan engagement” company that produces buildable mini-replicas of athletes from major professional sports leagues including the MLB, NFL, NHL and MLS, as well as some universities.[21]
Dick Clark Productions[edit]
In September, 2012, Peter Guber and Mandalay Entertainment joined a partnership which purchased Dick Clark Productions from Red Zone Capital Management.[22]
Their productions include specials like The Golden Globes, The American Music Awards, The Academy of Country Music Awards,New Year's Rockin' Eve, and reality show So You Think You Can Dance.[23]
Golden State Warriors[edit]
Peter Guber serves as the Co-Executive Chairman of the Golden State Warriors. As co-managing partner, he joined Joe Lacob as the driving forces behind the current ownership group’s NBA record-setting bid to purchase the Warriors in 2010.[24] The Warriors won the NBA Championships for the 2014-15 NBA season and 2016-17 NBA season.[25]
Consultant Marc Ganis said of the purchase, “This could be one of the most valuable teams in the NBA.”[26] The Golden State Warriors won the 2014 Sports Business Journal Award for Team of the Year, saying the team “continued a sharp trajectory in 2013 under owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber that produced strong, extensive on- and off-court gains,”[27]
Guber and Lacob agreed to buy 12 acres of land in San Francisco's Mission Bay neighborhood to build a privately financed new arena. The move would mark the Warrior’s return to a home arena in San Francisco (from Oakland) for the first time in more than four decades. Opening is targeted for the 2018-2019 season.[28]
Lacob said of Guber: "He cares more than any owner about the team, the image of the team and what the fans think."[29]
Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]
On March 27, 2012, Guber became an owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers as a Partner in Guggenheim Baseball Entertainment.[30] The Los Angeles Dodgers clinched the 2013 National League West Division Championship and played postseason baseball for the first time since 2009.[31]
Guber was persuaded to join the group purchasing the Dodgers by Magic Johnson. “Magic called and he said, ‘Come on, we’ve been so lucky together, we’ve been so good together, let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it,’ ” said Guber. So after meeting with Johnson, and others in the prospective ownership group, Guber decided to join the team that would make the $2.15 billion winning offer, which more than doubled the previous record price for a North American sports franchise.”[32]
Howard Nuchow, co-head of CAA Sports, described Guber’s contributions as attached to the entire baseball experience, "It's the notion Peter has that you have to entertain fans from the time they receive tickets in the mail until they drive home."[29]
Los Angeles Football Club[edit]
In October 2014, Peter Guber became the owner and executive chairman of Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC).[33] The ownership group includes entrepreneur Henry Nguyen, sports veteran Tom Penn, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Mia Hamm Garciaparra and Tony Robbins, among others. The new club is scheduled to debut in 2018 in a new soccer stadium in the greater Los Angeles area built specifically for the team.[34]
Author[edit]
Guber's most recent book, Tell To Win - Connect, Persuade, and Triumph with the Hidden Power of Story, became a #1 bestseller in The New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal. Fortune magazine chose Tell To Win as one of their "5 Business Books You Can Really Use." [35] "Peter Guber’s other books include Inside The Deep and The Los Angeles Times best-seller Shootout: Surviving Fame and (Mis)Fortune in Hollywood. Guber authored a cover piece for the Harvard Business Review,[36] and op-ed pieces for The New York Times.[37]
Professor[edit]
Peter Guber is a professor at the UCLA School of Theater, Film, Television and Digital Media and has been a member of the faculty for over 30 years. He also teaches at UCLA's Anderson School of Management.[38]
He is a member of the UCLA Foundation Board of Trustees, as well as the winner of UCLA's Service Award for his accomplishments and association with the university. Guber is the Chair of the Founding Board of Advisors for the Center for Managing Enterprises in Media, Entertainment & Sports (MEMES) at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.[39] [40]
Of his course, Guber said, “"I wanted students to recognize the power of narrative," he said. "Storytelling is not frivolous entertainment. It's an inspirational and professional tool that can bring life into focus." [41]
Speaker[edit]
In 2012, Guber was named one of the “Twelve Great Speakers of the Year” by Successful Meetings magazine.[42] Guber’s national and global speaking events include Cisco, JWT, Under Armour, Alcoa, HSBC, Twitter, Sodexo, Milken Institute, Intel, Korn Ferry, Women's Wear Daily CEO Summit, Wharton Leadership Conference, GAP, Inc, John Hancock Life Insurance, Experian Marketing, Del Monte Foods, Cox Media Group, Comcast.[43]

Early life[edit]
Peter Guber was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents, Sam Guber and Ruth Anshen, of Jewish descent, married in 1929. Sam Guber owned a junk business in Somerville, Massachusetts. As a child, Guber was noted as a “very smart, wired kid” by a childhood acquaintance. He attended John Ward Elementary School and Newton North High School.[3]:p. 61–62) Guber’s childhood included a love of the Boston Red Sox and Fenway Park, which foreshadowed his later participation in the group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers.[4]
Following high school graduation, Guber enrolled in the pre-law curriculum at Syracuse University. He played intramural football and rushed the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.[3]:p.62–63 Guber spent his junior year abroad at Syracuse's Florence, Italy campus. At Syracuse he met his future wife, Lynda Gellis.[3]:p.64
Guber enrolled at New York University, where he earned his J.D. and LL.M. law degrees, studying for his MBA at night.[3]:p.64 As he neared graduation in 1968, Guber accepted a position with Columbia Pictures, which was keen to recruit him, as a management trainee.[3]:p.64–65
Career[edit]
Columbia Pictures[edit]
Guber joined Columbia Pictures in 1968. At Columbia, Guber, an early proponent of computerization and entertainment technologies, began computerizing files on working actors and made available tape-recorded summaries of scripts for other executives to listen to while driving to work.[3]:p.68–69 A year after arriving at Columbia, Guber, having witnessed a demonstration of an early video cassette machine, published "The New Ballgame/The Cartridge Revolution," a "prescient" analysis of the changes to be wrought by home video technology, in the journal Cinema.[3]:p.69–70
Guber was transferred to the business affairs division.[3]:p.71 Guber paid to fly himself to Columbia's New York City office and successfully argued for his promotion to vice-president of creative affairs.[3]:p.71–72 Shortly thereafter Guber was named head of American production.[3]:p.73 In August 1973 he was promoted to vice-president of worldwide production. Steven Spielberg noted that he “used to go to (Guber’s) office at Columbia when (he) was just starting. (Guber) had an enormous chart on (his) wall with what every director in the world was planning that listed their pictures in development and planned for production.” It made a lasting impression on Spielberg.[5]
During his time at Columbia the studio released, among other films, Shampoo, Taxi Driver, Tommy, The Way We Were and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Upon leaving Columbia in 1975, Guber was given a three-year production deal with the studio.
Independent producer[edit]
Guber launched his career as an independent film producer with The Deep (1977), which became the second highest-grossing film of the year.[3]:p.86 Guber also bought the rights and served as executive producer for Midnight Express (1978). Produced by Alan Marshall and David Puttnam, the film earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. The National Association of Theater Owners named Guber Producer of the Year.
Casablanca Record and Filmworks[edit]
In 1976 Guber merged his company Filmworks with Casablanca Records, headed by Neil Bogart, to form Casablanca Record and Filmworks, Inc. Guber became chairman while Bogart remained President of the combined company. Their record operation included Kiss, Donna Summer, Captain and Tennille, The Village People, and George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic. It also released soundtracks such as Midnight Express, Endless Love, and Flashdance. During this period, Guber also produced several television shows and series, including Television and the Presidency (1984) with Theodore H. White, the 1985 documentary series Oceanquest for NBC, and the 1980 special Mysteries of the Sea for ABC.
PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and the Guber-Peters Company[edit]
In 1979, Guber formed PolyGram's motion picture and television division where he was Chairman of the Board and CEO. He sold his interest in PolyGram in 1983 and formed and served as co-owner of the Guber-Peters Company (GPC) along with producer Jon Peters.
Films on which Guber served as producer or executive producer have earned more than $3 billion in worldwide revenue and more than 50 Academy Award nominations, including four Best Picture nominations. Guber's producing credits include Rain Man, Batman, Gorillas in the Mist, The Color Purple, Innerspace, The Witches of Eastwick, Flashdance, Missing, Tango & Cash and An American Werewolf in London.
This period of Guber’s career was marked by sharp deal making which was often successful. With The Witches of Eastwick Guber was accused by producer Rob Cohen, who had originally approached Guber with the book, of having "bought the book out from under me" after negotiations had begun.[3]:p.136–7But Guber’s deal with Cohen allowed him to buy out the producer, and Cohen was advised that if he sued, he would lose.[3]:p.134
Sony Pictures[edit]
In 1988, GPC became a public company when they merged with game show production company Barris Industries and on September 7, 1989, Barris Industries was renamed Guber-Peters Entertainment Company.[6] On September 29, 1989, GPEC was acquired by Sony Corporation and Guber became chairman of the board and CEO of Columbia Pictures Entertainment (now Sony Pictures Entertainment). The sale was completed on November 9, 1989 a day after Sony acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment. During Guber's tenure at SPE, the company produced and distributed many prime time, half-hour comedy television series, with shows including Married... with Children, Designing Women, and Seinfeld (all launched prior to Guber's arrival), and Mad About You and The Nanny.
During Guber's tenure as chairman and CEO, SPE's Motion Picture Group achieved, over four years, an industry-best domestic box office market share, which averaged seventeen percent. During the same period, Sony Pictures led all competitors with 120 Academy Award nominations, the highest four-year total ever for a single company.[7] Some of SPE's motion picture credits at this time include Awakenings, Misery, Flatliners, Terminator 2, Boyz n the Hood, City Slickers, Basic Instinct, A League of Their Own, Single White Female, A River Runs Through It, A Few Good Men, Sleepless in Seattle, In the Line of Fire, Groundhog Day and Philadelphia.
Mandalay Entertainment[edit]
In 1995, Guber, as part of his severance agreement from Sony, formed Mandalay Entertainment as a joint venture with his former employer. The multimedia entertainment company has interests in motion pictures, television, sports entertainment and digital media.[8]
Mandalay Pictures[edit]
Mandalay Pictures, a division of Mandalay Entertainment Group, produces motion pictures for the global marketplace. Mandalay’s primary distributor relationship is through a first look deal with Universal Pictures.

Mandalay Television's Blood Crime, starring James Caan and Jonathan Schaech, was USA network's highest rated (Crime Friday) movie for 2002.
From best-selling author Nora Roberts, Peter Guber adapted a number of books into Lifetime movies.[13] More than 34 million viewers turned in to the first collection of four movies: Angels Fall, Blue Smoke, Carolina Moon and Montana Sky.[14]
Following the initial Nora Roberts' adaptations, Mandalay Television produced the Nora Roberts II Collection, with four more all-new original movies: Northern Lights, Midnight Bayou, High Noon and Tribute. The second collection was seen by over 49 million viewers, and Northern Lights was one of the top rated cable movies in 2009.[15] Mandalay Television completed the ninth installment in the franchise, Carnal Innocence, starring Gabrielle Anwar, which premiered on Lifetime in June 2011.[16]
Mandalay Sports Entertainment[edit]
Peter Guber serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors and is the Managing Partner of Mandalay Baseball LLC, which is a joint venture with ownership of the Los Angeles Dodgers that recently acquired the Triple-A affiliated Minor League Baseball franchise in Oklahoma City, and commencing with the 2015 baseball season, will become the Triple-A affiliate of the Dodgers.[17]
He also continues to serve as the Chairman of the Board of Directors for Mandalay Baseball Properties, which has owned, operated and is currently divesting a national array of affiliated Minor League Baseball franchises and venues. Among the professional sports franchises that have been recently divested by Mandalay Baseball Properties are the Dayton Dragons, a Single-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds which broke the all-time North American professional sports record for consecutive sell outs in 2011 with 815 games encompassing 12 seasons, and in August 2014 was sold for the highest price ever paid for a Minor League Baseball franchise.[18]
Mandalay Baseball Properties continues to own and operate the Erie SeaWolves, a Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.
Mandalay Sports Media[edit]
In 2012, Guber and Mandalay Entertainment partnered with CAA Sports and Mike Tollin to create Mandalay Sports Media.[19] The sports media business creates, finances, and acquires operating businesses, intellectual property, and varied enterprises within the sports and media sectors, as well as develops sports-themed entertainment programming for distribution across film, television, mobile and digital.[20]
In October 2014, Mandalay Sports Media invested in and became the largest shareholder in OYO Sports, a “fan engagement” company that produces buildable mini-replicas of athletes from major professional sports leagues including the MLB, NFL, NHL and MLS, as well as some universities.[21]
Dick Clark Productions[edit]
In September, 2012, Peter Guber and Mandalay Entertainment joined a partnership which purchased Dick Clark Productions from Red Zone Capital Management.[22]
Their productions include specials like The Golden Globes, The American Music Awards, The Academy of Country Music Awards,New Year's Rockin' Eve, and reality show So You Think You Can Dance.[23]
Golden State Warriors[edit]
Peter Guber serves as the Co-Executive Chairman of the Golden State Warriors. As co-managing partner, he joined Joe Lacob as the driving forces behind the current ownership group’s NBA record-setting bid to purchase the Warriors in 2010.[24] The Warriors won the NBA Championships for the 2014-15 NBA season and 2016-17 NBA season.[25]
Consultant Marc Ganis said of the purchase, “This could be one of the most valuable teams in the NBA.”[26] The Golden State Warriors won the 2014 Sports Business Journal Award for Team of the Year, saying the team “continued a sharp trajectory in 2013 under owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber that produced strong, extensive on- and off-court gains,”[27]
Guber and Lacob agreed to buy 12 acres of land in San Francisco's Mission Bay neighborhood to build a privately financed new arena. The move would mark the Warrior’s return to a home arena in San Francisco (from Oakland) for the first time in more than four decades. Opening is targeted for the 2018-2019 season.[28]
Lacob said of Guber: "He cares more than any owner about the team, the image of the team and what the fans think."[29]
Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]
On March 27, 2012, Guber became an owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers as a Partner in Guggenheim Baseball Entertainment.[30] The Los Angeles Dodgers clinched the 2013 National League West Division Championship and played postseason baseball for the first time since 2009.[31]
Guber was persuaded to join the group purchasing the Dodgers by Magic Johnson. “Magic called and he said, ‘Come on, we’ve been so lucky together, we’ve been so good together, let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it,’ ” said Guber. So after meeting with Johnson, and others in the prospective ownership group, Guber decided to join the team that would make the $2.15 billion winning offer, which more than doubled the previous record price for a North American sports franchise.”[32]
Howard Nuchow, co-head of CAA Sports, described Guber’s contributions as attached to the entire baseball experience, "It's the notion Peter has that you have to entertain fans from the time they receive tickets in the mail until they drive home."[29]
Los Angeles Football Club[edit]
In October 2014, Peter Guber became the owner and executive chairman of Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC).[33] The ownership group includes entrepreneur Henry Nguyen, sports veteran Tom Penn, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Mia Hamm Garciaparra and Tony Robbins, among others. The new club is scheduled to debut in 2018 in a new soccer stadium in the greater Los Angeles area built specifically for the team.[34]
Author[edit]
Guber's most recent book, Tell To Win - Connect, Persuade, and Triumph with the Hidden Power of Story, became a #1 bestseller in The New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal. Fortune magazine chose Tell To Win as one of their "5 Business Books You Can Really Use." [35] "Peter Guber’s other books include Inside The Deep and The Los Angeles Times best-seller Shootout: Surviving Fame and (Mis)Fortune in Hollywood. Guber authored a cover piece for the Harvard Business Review,[36] and op-ed pieces for The New York Times.[37]
Professor[edit]
Peter Guber is a professor at the UCLA School of Theater, Film, Television and Digital Media and has been a member of the faculty for over 30 years. He also teaches at UCLA's Anderson School of Management.[38]
He is a member of the UCLA Foundation Board of Trustees, as well as the winner of UCLA's Service Award for his accomplishments and association with the university. Guber is the Chair of the Founding Board of Advisors for the Center for Managing Enterprises in Media, Entertainment & Sports (MEMES) at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.[39] [40]
Of his course, Guber said, “"I wanted students to recognize the power of narrative," he said. "Storytelling is not frivolous entertainment. It's an inspirational and professional tool that can bring life into focus." [41]
Speaker[edit]
In 2012, Guber was named one of the “Twelve Great Speakers of the Year” by Successful Meetings magazine.[42] Guber’s national and global speaking events include Cisco, JWT, Under Armour, Alcoa, HSBC, Twitter, Sodexo, Milken Institute, Intel, Korn Ferry, Women's Wear Daily CEO Summit, Wharton Leadership Conference, GAP, Inc, John Hancock Life Insurance, Experian Marketing, Del Monte Foods, Cox Media Group, Comcast.[43]

Court Brouhaha Over Ancient Coins

   			Court Brouhaha Over Ancient Coins   		


MATT REYNOLDS  July 9, 2014


     LOS ANGELES (CN) – A businessman sued a rare coin dealer for more than $3.5 million, claiming the L.A. dealer refuses to return several ancient Greek coins and a bronze Roman head of Lucius Aelius Verus as Caesar.     Peter Guber, as trustee for the Guber Family Trust, sued dealers Robert Freeman and Tory Freeman, partners in Freeman & Sear, on July 3 in Superior Court.     Guber, an art and antique collector and entrepreneur, claims that from 2008 he bought and sold ancient coins through the dealers “without incident.” In that time, he says, he built a collection of 84 Greek coins.     In 2010, Guber says, agreed to let the Freemans take possession of the coins so they could sell them for him on consignment. The coin dealers sold 38 of the coins, and relying on their advice, Guber says, he agreed to trade 42 of the remaining coins for a bronze Roman head of Lucius Aelius Verus as Caesar.     Lucius Aelius Varus, 101-138, was an adopted son of Hadrian. He died before he attained the emperorship.     Guber claims the Freemans told him they would auction the bronze head in Paris on June 15, 2012 for up to $2.7 million.     That left four unsold ancient silver coins, the oldest of which dates back to 350 B.C., Guber says. He says he allowed the Freemans to keep the coins, based on an understanding that they would eventually sell them.     Though the Freemans in June 2012 told Guber they had aborted plans to sell the bronze head in Paris, they promised they would continue to try to sell it, Guber says.     But by March this year, the coins and bronze head were still looking for a new owner. Guber says he asked the Freemans to return his property.     “Later on March 7, 2014, Mr. Guber discovered that defendants were sued by Larry Goldberg Coins & Collectibles, Inc. (Goldberg). In that lawsuit (Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. SCI21209), Goldberg alleges, among other things, that defendants pledged as security for a debt owed by defendants the bronze head and possibly some or all of the missing coins. Mr. Guber was unaware of this pledge, and at no time consented to the use of the trust’s property as collateral for the debts of defendants,” the July 3 complaint states.     The first lawsuit, filed in August 2013 and obtained by Courthouse News, claimed that the Freemans had defrauded Goldberg, bought coins under an alias without paying for them, bounced checks and delayed payments. Goldberg sought $2.1 million in damages.     Guber says that despite the Freemans’ assurances, they have not returned the bronze head and coins.     He seeks $3,523,550 in damages and an order that forces the Freemans to return them     He is represented by Mark Campbell with Loeb & Loeb.     Freeman and Sear did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
