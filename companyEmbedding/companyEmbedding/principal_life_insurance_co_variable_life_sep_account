Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Your Retirement Wellness Score



                Your Retirement Wellness Score indicates the percentage of your pre-retirement income that is estimated to be
                              available at the specified retirement age (based on your personalized inputs and current assumptions). Studies
                              suggest replacing at least 70-85% of your income in retirement.                *
              

                The score compares what you are estimated to have in monthly income at retirement against your estimated monthly
                                pre-retirement income. For example, based on your inputs you may have $1,000 per month when you retire, but your
                                monthly pre-retirement income is $2,000. Your Retirement Wellness Score would be 50.              

                This score, and what you will have, are merely estimates based on information provided by you and several
                              financial assumptions, including a 4.5% withdrawal rate. This information may be valued as of different dates.
                              This is not a guarantee of future income.              

                Your Retirement Wellness Score always assumes you are replacing 100% of your pre-retirement income.
                              So, it will not change if you make changes that impact your desired income in retirement.

                                or non-qualified retirement plan assets.

Your Retirement Wellness Score



                Your Retirement Wellness Score indicates the percentage of your pre-retirement income that is estimated to be
                              available at the specified retirement age (based on your personalized inputs and current assumptions). Studies
                              suggest replacing at least 70-85% of your income in retirement.                *
              

                The score compares what you are estimated to have in monthly income at retirement against your estimated monthly
                                pre-retirement income. For example, based on your inputs you may have $1,000 per month when you retire, but your
                                monthly pre-retirement income is $2,000. Your Retirement Wellness Score would be 50.              

                This score, and what you will have, are merely estimates based on information provided by you and several
                              financial assumptions, including a 4.5% withdrawal rate. This information may be valued as of different dates.
                              This is not a guarantee of future income.              

                Your Retirement Wellness Score always assumes you are replacing 100% of your pre-retirement income.
                              So, it will not change if you make changes that impact your desired income in retirement.

401(k) and 403(b) Retirement Plans 



Save for retirement an easy way.

Does your employer offer a 401(k) or 403(b) plan? These common retirement savings plans can help make the process of saving for retirement easy.What does a 403(b) or 401(k) plan offer?These plans can help you build your retirement savings with:Automatic payroll deductions to help you make saving a habitReduced taxable income, since your pre-tax contributions lower your taxable incomeMatched contributions from some employers, up to a certain percent (check with your benefits administrator)Long-term savings and growth potential across a variety of the plan’s investment optionsDoes your employer offer a 401(k) or 403(b) plan with services through Principal®? Enroll online now 

 
A little today may be a lot tomorrow.

If you’re already enrolled in a 401(k) or 403(b) plan with services by Principal, you might consider increasing the amount you contribute from each paycheck.

Looking for a 401(k) or 403(b) plan loan?

When bills or debt feel overwhelming, it can be tempting to consider borrowing against your account in a 403(b) or a 401(k) plan. But the trade-offs can be steep—and we want to make sure you understand them.In the long run, you may pay more than the loan amount you withdraw, including:Any initial set-up and quarterly loan fees;Taxes you pay on the money you use to repay your loan; andLoan interest rates over timeOn top of that, you may miss out on potential growth and compounding of your earnings, which can be a major advantage of long-term savings in an account under 401(k) and 403(b) plans.To give you an idea, $20,000 in a 401(k) or 403(b) account could triple in 20 years at an average 7% rate of return —but not if you withdraw it today. Log in to learn more about retirement loans, and talk to your financial professional before you make a decision.

Short and Sharp: The twisted relationship between central banks and inflation

Investors currently face the challenge of the Federal Reserve’s belief that monetary policy needs to be tightened, despite missing inflationary pressures. This is not just a U.S. phenomenon, it’s a global one. In the euro-area, core inflation remains stubbornly low, yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely gearing up to announce its tapering plans.

     I understand the costs associated with the purchase of a 529 Plan ("Plan"),                                                    
 as fully described in the Plan's Program Disclosure Document. These costs may                                                      
 include charges imposed by the state or other government entity offering the                                                       
 Plan, the firm(s) providing investment management or other services to the

 of the Plan's Program Disclosure Document. If this product offers multiple                                                         
 share classes for investment purposes, my representative has explained the                                                         
 differences in costs associated with different share classes and I have                                                            
 selected the share class(es) that I believe is/are most appropriate in light of                                                    
 my investment objectives and time horizon.                                                                                         
     I understand that some states offer favorable tax benefits to residents                                                        
 only when investing in that state's Plan and that I should consult with a                                                          
 qualified tax advisor. I should also contact my resident state's 529 Plan

 benefits that might be available if I invest in the in-state Plan as opposed to

     If, after weighing any lost tax or other benefits available to me, I have                                                      
 chosen to invest in an out-of-state Plan, it is for one or more of the                                                             
 following reasons (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY):                                                                                          
     The tax benefits of the in-state plan are insignificant or unavailable to me.                                                  
     I have existing assets with the fund family(ies)/ investment choices which                                                     
     qualify this investment for breakpoints. I prefer the fund family(ies)/                                                        
     investment choices offered in the out-of-state 529 plan. The out-of-state                                                      
     529 plan offers lower fees and/or expenses.                                                                                    
     The out-of-state 529 plan offers a better performance history.                                                                 
     I am investing through my employer and am eligible for reduced or no sales                                                     
     charges. If I choose the in-state 529 plan, my Princor registered

        reflected  in the fees for this  product.  The selling  financial  professional  (or  affiliated  entity) may receive  this 
        compensation from Us or from another entity through which business is placed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Princor Financial Services Corporation has developed a Business Continuity Plan 
on how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our business. Since 
the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will    
have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in  
mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity     
plan.                                                                           

Contacting Us - If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us
as you usually do at 888-774-6267 or 800-247-4123, you should go to our Web site
at www.principal.com.                                                           

Business Continuity Plan - We plan to quickly recover and resume business       
operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding  
our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment,      
protecting the firm's books and records, and allowing our customers to transact 
business. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm 
to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the
significant business disruption.                                                

Our business continuity plan addresses: data back up and recovery; all mission  
critical business functions and supporting systems; financial and operational   
assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and          
regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier,        
contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring   
our customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to   
continue our business.                                                          

Varying Disruptions - Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, 
such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the business district
where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region.  
Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from   
minimal to severe. In a disruption to only our firm or a building housing our   
firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and strive to 
recover and resume business within 24 hours. In a disruption affecting our      
business district, city, or region, we will transfer our operations to a site   
outside of the affected area, and strive to recover and resume business as soon 
as administratively possible. In either situation, we plan to continue in       
business, and notify you through our Web site, www.principal.com, or you can    
contact us at 888-774-6267, or 800-247-4123. If the significant business        
disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will 
assure our customer's prompt access to their funds and securities.              

For more information - If you have questions about our business continuity      
planning, you can contact us at 888-774-6267 ext. 59168 (Princor Compliance.)

Life Insurance 

Coverage not just for your life, but for your life’s purposeLife insurance protects those who depend on your life, so there’s no sudden monetary shortage in the event of your death. A life insurance policy can help your family recover from loss and continue to:Pay for your final expensesPay off a mortgagePay for childcare and education costsCover outstanding debtsComplete a retirement planAccess estate liquidityProvide lifetime incomeIf someone besides you depends on your income, life insurance can help provide for your loved ones at a time when they may need it the most. 

Two types of life insurance for evolving needsPrincipal® offers a range of life insurance products to fit your current and future needs. For a mix of short- and long-term needs, you may even elect both types. 


Term Life InsuranceGives you budget-based coverage for a specific period of time. 

Permanent Life InsuranceOffers long-term coverage for long-term benefits. 


Already have life insurance through work?That’s a great start, but group life insurance provides a base level of protection and isn’t designed to meet 100% of your life insurance needs.Plus, if you switch jobs, your coverage could change, leaving you vulnerable to losing accumulated benefits in your job transition.Ask your company’s benefits administrator about your group policy, and talk to your advisor about how to supplement your policy for minimal cost.

  SUPPLEMENT DATED AUGUST 18, 2004
  TO THE
 PRINCIPAL VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE ACCUMULATOR II PROSPECTUS
  DATED APRIL 30, 2004

The following changes have been made for Policies dated August 23, 2004 or      
after:                                                                          

The Death Benefit Guarantee Rider description on page 20 is expanded so that the
"level of premium (planned or paid) at issue, determines whether the no-lapse   
guarantee is extended to the insured's attained age 65 or attained age 85 or    
attained age 100."                                                              

The following replaces the "Premiums Affecting Guarantee Provisions" section    
beginning on page 23:                                                           

PREMIUMS AFFECTING GUARANTEE PROVISIONS 

Your initial premium must be at least the no-lapse guarantee premium. After the 
initial premium, you may determine the amount and timing of subsequent premium  
payments (with certain restrictions): however, we recommend you continue to pay 
at least the no-lapse guarantee premium. By meeting the no-lapse guarantee      
premium requirement, your Policy is guaranteed not to terminate during the first
five policy years even if the net surrender value is insufficient to cover the  
monthly policy charge.                                                          

The no-lapse guarantee premium requirement is met if ((a) minus (b)) is greater 
than or equal to (c) where:                                                     
(a) is the sum of premiums paid;                                        
(b) is the sum of all loan indebtedness and partial surrenders; and     
  (c) is the sum of the no-lapse guarantee monthly premiums since the policy
date to the most recent monthly date.                             

If the no-lapse premium requirement is not met and the net surrender value is   
insufficient to cover the monthly policy charge, the Policy may terminate in the
first five policy years.                                                        

If the Death Benefit Guarantee rider is made a part of your Policy and you pay  
at least the death benefit guarantee premium requirement, the death benefit     
guarantee period will last longer than the five year period provided by the     
no-lapse guarantee provision. You choose whether you want the no-lapse guarantee
period to extend to the insured's attained age 65, attained age 85 or attained  
age 100. Generally, a longer death benefit guarantee period will have a higher  
premium requirement.                                                            

The premium requirement is ((a) divided by 1,000) times (b) where:              
(a) is the policy face amount; and                                      
(b) is the premium rate.                                                

                                                                [Download Table]

                                   EXAMPLE                                     
    If the policy face amount is $250,000 with Death Benefit Option 2 and      
  the insured is a 45-year old male with a risk classification of preferred    
                                 non-smoker:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You choose the death benefit guarantee period based on your scheduled premium   
payments. The death benefit guarantee premium requirement is met if ((a) minus  
(b)) is greater than or equal to (c) where:                                     
(a) is the sum of premiums paid;                                        
(b) is the sum of all loan indebtedness and partial surrenders; and     
(c) is the sum of the death benefit guarantee monthly premiums since the
policy date to the most recent monthly date.                      

If the death benefit guarantee premium requirement is not met, the Death Benefit
Guarantee Rider will terminate. If in the first five policy years, the Policy   
will still have the no-lapse guarantee as long as the premiums paid are         
sufficient to meet the no-lapse guarantee premium requirement.                  

P-->4972nd�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�2nd
Both the no-lapse guarantee premium and the death benefit guarantee premium     
rates are per $1000 of face amount and vary by issue age, gender*, death benefit
option and smoking status. The no-lapse guarantee premium and the death benefit 
guarantee premium are shown on the current data pages.                          
 * For Policies issued in states which require unisex pricing or in connection
 with employment related insurance and benefit plans, the premiums are not
based on the gender of the insured.                                     

Effective August 30, 2004, the following divisions are available through the    
Policy:

sub-advisory agreement

              growth of capital and current income by investing primarily in
           shares of other Principal Variable Contracts Fund accounts.

The prospectus for the Principal Variable Contracts Fund, Inc. which is attached
to the prospectus for the Policy is amended to include the following:           

PRINCIPAL LIFETIME 2010 ACCOUNT                                                 
The Account seeks a total return consisting of long-term growth of capital and  
current income.                                                                 

MAIN STRATEGIES                                                                 
To pursue its goal, the Account invests in shares of other Principal Variable   
Contracts Fund Accounts (the "underlying funds"). The underlying funds are      
intended to give the Account broad exposure to the domestic and foreign equity  
and fixed-income markets.                                                       

P-->4973rd�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�3rd
Over time, shifts in the allocations to the underlying funds will be designed to
accommodate investors progressing from asset accumulation years to              
income-generation years; shifts in the underlying fund allocations may also     
occur when market forces change allocations in ways the Sub-Advisor, Principal, 
considers likely to help the Account achieve its investment objective.          

In deciding how to allocation the Account's assets among the underlying funds at
any time, Principal considers long-term asset class returns, volatility         
assumptions and the Account's target time horizon. There are no minimum or      
maximum percentages in which the Account must invest in any underlying fund. As 
the Account is weighted toward underlying funds that invest in fixed-income     
securities (see table below), the Account is more subject to the risk of        
interest rate changes and credit risk than to the risks associated with a stock 
funds. At any time, Principal may add or substitute underlying funds in which   
the Account invests.                                                            

Principal intends to gradually shift the Account's allocation among the         
underlying funds so that within five to ten years after the year 2010, the      
Account's underlying fund allocation matches the underlying fund allocation of  
the Principal LifeTime Strategic Income Account, an Account that invests        
primarily in fixed-income securities. At that time, the Account may be combined 
with the Principal LifeTime Strategic Income Account. The Board of Directors    
would need to determine at the time of the proposed combination that the        
combining of the Accounts is in the best interests of the Accounts'             
shareholders. If the Board determines that the proposed combination is          
appropriate, it will seek: 1) an order of substitution from the Securities and  
Exchange Commission; 2) submit the issue to a vote of the shareholders; 3) or a 
combination of both 1 and 2.                                                    

MAIN RISKS                                                                      
The Account's investments are concentrated in the underlying funds and, as a    
result, the Account's performance is directly related to their performance. The 
Account's ability to meet its investment objective depends on the ability of the
underlying funds to achieve their investment objectives. Consequently, the      
Account is subject to the particular risks of the underlying funds in the       
proportions in which the Account invests in them.                               

As with any security, the securities in which the underlying funds invest have  
associated risks. These include risks of:                                       

INTEREST RATE CHANGES The value of fixed-income securities held by the Account  
may be affected by factors such as changing interest rates, credit rating, and  
effective maturities. When interest rates fall, the price of a bond rises and   
when interest rates rise, the price declines.                                   

CREDIT RISK Lower quality and longer maturity bonds will be subject to greater  
credit risk and price fluctuations than higher quality and shorter maturity     
bonds. Bonds held by the Account may be affected by unfavorable political,      
economic, or governmental developments that could affect the repayment of       
principal or the payment of interest.                                           

HIGH YIELD SECURITIES Fixed-income securities that are not investment grade are 
commonly referred to as junk bonds or high yield securities. These securities   
offer a higher yield than other, higher rated securities, but they carry a      
greater degree of risk and are considered speculative by the major credit rating
agencies. (please see High Yield Securities in the section of the Prospectus    
entitled CERTAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND RELATED RISKS).                      

U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED SECURITIES The Account may invest in debt and         
mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises such as   
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage       
Association and the Federal Home Loan Banks. Although the issuing agency,       
instrumentality or corporation maybe chartered or sponsored by the United States
government, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the United    
States Treasury.                                                                

STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY The net asset value of the Account's shares is effected 
by changes in the value of the securities it owns. The prices of equity         
securities held by the Account may decline in response to certain events        
including those directly involving issuers of these securities, adverse         
conditions affecting the general economy, or overall market declines. In the    
short term, stock prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these        
factors.

FOREIGN INVESTING Foreign markets and currencies may not perform as well as U.S.
markets. Political and economic uncertainty in foreign countries, as well as    
less public information about foreign investments may negatively impact the     
Account's portfolio. Dividends and other income payable on foreign securities   
may be subject to foreign taxes. Some investments may be made in currencies     
other than the U.S. dollar that will fluctuate in value as a result of changes  
in the currency exchange rate.                                                  

SMALL AND MEDIUM CAPITALIZATIONS Companies with small capitalizations are often 
companies with a limited operation history. Such companies may have been created
in response to cultural, economic, regulatory or technological developments.    
Such developments can have significant impact or negative effect on smaller     
capitalization companies securities which may be more volatile in price than    
larger company securities, especially over the short-term.                      

HEDGING STRATEGIES Use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, currency 
or index futures or other derivatives involves risks. The contracts may increase
the Account's volatility and, thus, could involve a significant risk. If the    
Sub-Advisor's predictions are inaccurate, the averse consequences to the        
Account(e.g., a reduction in the Account's net asset value) may leave the       
Account in a worse position than if these strategies were not used.             

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS ("IPOS") The Account's purchase of shares issued in    
IPOs exposes it to the additional risks associated with companies that have     
little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent  
in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate. The market for  
IPO issuers has been volatile and share prices of certain newly-public companies
have fluctuated in significant amounts over short periods of time. In addition, 
the Sub-Advisor cannot guarantee continued access to IPO offerings, and may at  
times dispose of those shares shortly after their acquisition.                  

The Account's broad diversification is designed to cushion severe losses in any 
one investment sector and moderate the Account's overall price swings. However, 
the Account's share prices will fluctuate as the prices of the underlying funds 
rise or fall with changing market conditions. As with all mutual funds, as the  

values of the Account's assets rise or fall, the Account's share price changes. 
If you sell your shares when                                                    

their value is less than the price you paid, you will lose money.               

INVESTOR PROFILE                                                                
The Account may be an appropriate investment for investors expecting to retire  
around the year 2010 or fund a cashflow need in the year 2010.                  

UNDERLYING FUND ALLOCATION                                                      
Principal anticipates initially allocating Account assets among the underlying  
funds as follows:                                                               

                                                                [Download Table]

                                                                     
Bond                       30.2%    LargeCap Value               7.9%
Capital Value               4.3     LargeCap Stock Index        12.7 
Equity Growth               4.4     Money Market                 9.4 
Equity Income               7.0     Real Estate Securities       9.4 
Growth                      4.4     SmallCap                     3.7 
International               6.6                                      

Based on this allocation, the weighted average of the total account operating   
expenses of the underlying funds is 0.61%. The combined total expenses for the  
Account may be higher or lower depending on the allocation of its assets among  
the underlying funds.                                                           

As the inception date of the Account is August 30, 2004, historical performance 
data is not available.

(These fees and expenses do not include the effect of any sales charge, separate
account expenses or other contract level expenses which may be applied at the   
variable life insurance or variable annuity product level. If such charges or   
                                 -

                                          ----                                                                                  
 TOTAL ACCOUNT OPERATING EXPENSES         0.22                                                                                  
 The Manager has voluntarily agreed to reimburse operating expenses so that the total Account operating expenses will not be    
 greater than 0.16% through April 30, 2005. The Manager may not continue this arrangement after May 1, 2005.                    
 The Account as a shareholder in the underlying funds, indirectly bears its pro rata share of the operating expenses incurred by
 each underlying fund. As of December 31, 2003, the operating expenses of the underlying funds ranged from 0.39% to 1.84%. The  
 Account's investment return is net of the underlying funds' operating expenses.                                                

EXAMPLES                                                                      
 The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the Account for the time periods
indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The 
Examples also assume that your investment has a 5% return each year and that  
the Account's operating expenses remain the same. If the operating expenses of
the underlying funds, separate account expenses and contract level expenses   
were included, expenses would be higher. Although your actual costs may be    
higher or lower, based on these assumptions your cost would be:

PRINCIPAL LIFETIME 2020 ACCOUNT                                                 
The Account seeks a total return consisting of long-term growth of capital and  
current income.                                                                 

MAIN STRATEGIES                                                                 
To pursue its goal, the Account invests in shares of other Principal Variable   
Contracts Fund Accounts (the "underlying funds"). The underlying funds are      
intended to give the Account broad exposure to the domestic and foreign equity  
and fixed-income markets.                                                       

Over time, shifts in the allocations to the underlying funds will be designed to
accommodate investors progressing from asset accumulation years to              
income-generation years; shifts in the underlying fund allocations may also     
occur when market forces change allocations in ways the Sub-Advisor, Principal, 
considers likely to help the Account achieve its investment objective.          

In deciding how to allocation the Account's assets among the underlying funds at
any time, Principal considers long-term asset class returns, volatility         
assumptions and the Account's target time horizon. There are no minimum or      
maximum percentages in which the Account must invest in any underlying fund. As 
the Account is weighted toward underlying funds that invest in equity securities
(see table below), the Account is more subject to the risks associated with     
stock funds than to the risk of interest rate changes and credit risk. At any   
time, Principal may add or substitute underlying funds in which the Account     
invests.                                                                        

Principal intends to gradually shift the Account's allocation among the         
underlying funds so that within five to ten years after the year 2020, the      
Account's underlying fund allocation matches the underlying fund allocation of  
the Principal LifeTime Strategic Income Account, an Account that invests        
primarily in fixed-income securities. At that time, the Account may be combined 
with the Principal LifeTime Strategic Income Account. The Board of Directors    
would need to determine at the time of the proposed combination that the        
combining of the Accounts is in the best interests of the Accounts'             
shareholders. If the Board determines that the proposed combination is          
appropriate, it will seek: 1) an order of substitution from the Securities and  
Exchange Commission; 2) submit the issue to a vote of the shareholders; 3) or a 
combination of both 1 and 2.                                                    

MAIN RISKS                                                                      
The Account's investments are concentrated in the underlying funds and, as a    
result, the Account's performance is directly related to their performance. The 
Account's ability to meet its investment objective depends on the ability of the
underlying funds to achieve their investment objectives. Consequently, the      
Account is subject to the particular risks of the underlying funds in the       
proportions in which the Account                                                

P-->4976th�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
invests in them. As with all mutual funds, as the values of the Account's assets
rise or fall, the Account's                                                     
share price changes. If you sell your shares when their value is less than the  
price you paid, you will lose                                                   
money.                                                                          

As with any security, the securities in which the underlying funds invest have  
associated risks. These include risks of:                                       

STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY The net asset value of the Account's shares is effected 
by changes in the value of the securities it owns. The prices of equity         
securities held by the Account may decline in response to certain events        
including those directly involving issuers of these securities, adverse         
conditions affecting the general economy, or overall market declines. In the    
short term, stock prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these        
factors.                                                                        

SMALL AND MEDIUM CAPITALIZATIONS Companies with small capitalizations are often 
companies with a limited operation history. Such companies may have been created
in response to cultural, economic, regulatory or technological developments.    
Such developments can have significant impact or negative effect on smaller     
capitalization companies securities which may be more volatile in price than    
larger company securities, especially over the short-term.                      

FOREIGN INVESTING Foreign markets and currencies may not perform as well as U.S.
markets. Political and economic uncertainty in foreign countries, as well as    
less public information about foreign investments may negatively impact the     
Account's portfolio. Dividends and other income payable on foreign securities   
may be subject to foreign taxes. Some investments may be made in currencies     
other than the U.S. dollar that will fluctuate in value as a result of changes  
in the currency exchange rate.                                                  

HEDGING STRATEGIES Use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, currency 
or index futures or other derivatives involves risks. The contracts may increase
the Account's volatility and, thus, could involve a significant risk. If the    
Sub-Advisor's predictions are inaccurate, the averse consequences to the        
Account(e.g., a reduction in the Account's net asset value) may leave the       
Account in a worse position than if these strategies were not used.             

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS ("IPOS") The Account's purchase of shares issued in    
IPOs exposes it to the additional risks associated with companies that have

the Sub-Advisor cannot guarantee continued access to IPO offerings, and may at  
times dispose of those shares shortly after their acquisition.                  

INTEREST RATE CHANGES The value of fixed-income securities held by the Account  
may be affected by factors such as changing interest rates, credit rating, and  
effective maturities. When interest rates fall, the price of a bond rises and   
when interest rates rise, the price declines.                                   

CREDIT RISK Lower quality and longer maturity bonds will be subject to greater  
credit risk and price fluctuations than higher quality and shorter maturity     
bonds. Bonds held by the Account may be affected by unfavorable political,      
economic, or governmental developments that could affect the repayment of       
principal or the payment of interest.                                           

HIGH YIELD SECURITIES Fixed-income securities that are not investment grade are 
commonly referred to as junk bonds or high yield securities. These securities   
offer a higher yield than other, higher rated securities, but they carry a      
greater degree of risk and are considered speculative by the major credit rating
agencies. (please see High Yield Securities in the section of the Prospectus    
entitled CERTAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND RELATED RISKS)                       

U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED SECURITIES The Account may invest in debt and         
mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises such as   
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage       
Association and the Federal Home Loan Banks. Although the issuing agency,       
instrumentality or corporation maybe chartered or sponsored by the United States
government, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the United    
States Treasury.

The Fund may be an appropriate investment for investors expecting to retire     
around the year 2020 or fund a cashflow need in the year 2020.

 TOTAL ACCOUNT OPERATING EXPENSES         0.19                                                                                  
 The Manager has voluntarily agreed to reimburse operating expenses so that the total Account operating expenses will not be    
 greater than 0.13% through April 30, 2005. The Manager may not continue this arrangement after May 1, 2005.                    
 The Account as a shareholder in the underlying funds, indirectly bears its pro rata share of the operating expenses incurred by
 each underlying fund. As of December 31, 2003, the operating expenses of the underlying funds ranged from 0.39% to 1.84%. The  
 Account's investment return is net of the underlying funds' operating expenses.                                                

EXAMPLES                                                                      
 The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the Account for the time periods
indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The 
Examples also assume that your investment has a 5% return each year and that  
the Account's operating expenses remain the same. If the operating expenses of
the underlying funds, separate account expenses and contract level expenses   
were included, expenses would be higher. Although your actual costs may be    
higher or lower, based on these assumptions your cost would be:

PRINCIPAL LIFETIME 2030 ACCOUNT                                                 
The Account seeks a total return consisting of long-term growth of capital and  
current income.                                                                 

MAIN STRATEGIES                                                                 
To pursue its goal, the Account invests in shares of other Principal Variable   
Contracts Fund Accounts (the "underlying funds"). The underlying funds are      
intended to give the Account broad exposure to the domestic and foreign equity  
and fixed-income markets.                                                       

Over time, shifts in the allocations to the underlying funds will be designed to
accommodate investors progressing from asset accumulation years to              
income-generation years; shifts in the underlying fund allocations may also     
occur when market forces change allocations in ways the Sub-Advisor, Principal, 
considers likely to help the Account achieve its investment objective.          

In deciding how to allocation the Account's assets among the underlying funds at
any time, Principal considers long-term asset class returns, volatility         
assumptions and the Account's target time horizon. There are no minimum or      
maximum percentages in which the Account must invest in any underlying fund. As 
the Account is weighted toward underlying funds that invest in equity securities
(see table below), the                                                          

P-->4978th�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
Account is more subject to the risks associated with stock funds than to the    
risk of interest rate changes and credit risk. At any time, Principal may add or
substitute underlying funds in which the Account invests.                       

Principal intends to gradually shift the Account's allocation among the         
underlying funds so that within five to ten years after the year 2030, the      
Account's underlying fund allocation matches the underlying fund allocation of  
the Principal LifeTime Strategic Income Account, an Account that invests        
primarily in fixed-income securities. At that time, the Account may be combined 
with the Principal LifeTime Strategic Income Account. The Board of Directors    
would need to determine at the time of the proposed combination that the        
combining of the Accounts is in the best interests of the Accounts'             
shareholders. If the Board determines that the proposed combination is          
appropriate, it will seek: 1) an order of substitution from the Securities and  
Exchange Commission; 2) submit the issue to a vote of the shareholders; 3) or a 
combination of both 1 and 2.                                                    

MAIN RISKS                                                                      
The Account's investments are concentrated in the underlying funds and, as a    
result, the Account's performance is directly related to their performance. The 
Account's ability to meet its investment objective depends on the ability of the
underlying funds to achieve their investment objectives. Consequently, the      
Account is subject to the particular risks of the underlying funds in the       
proportions in which the Account invests in them. As with all mutual funds, as  
the values of the Account's assets rise or fall, the Account's                  
share price changes. If you sell your shares when their value is less than the  
price you paid, you will lose                                                   
money.                                                                          

As with any security, the securities in which the underlying funds invest have  
associated risks. These include risks of:                                       

STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY The net asset value of the Account's shares is effected 
by changes in the value of the securities it owns. The prices of equity         
securities held by the Account may decline in response to certain events        
including those directly involving issuers of these securities, adverse         
conditions affecting the general economy, or overall market declines. In the    
short term, stock prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these        
factors.                                                                        

SMALL AND MEDIUM CAPITALIZATIONS Companies with small capitalizations are often 
companies with a limited operation history. Such companies may have been created
in response to cultural, economic, regulatory or technological developments.    
Such developments can have significant impact or negative effect on smaller     
capitalization companies securities which may be more volatile in price than    
larger company securities, especially over the short-term.                      

FOREIGN INVESTING Foreign markets and currencies may not perform as well as U.S.
markets. Political and economic uncertainty in foreign countries, as well as    
less public information about foreign investments may negatively impact the     
Account's portfolio. Dividends and other income payable on foreign securities   
may be subject to foreign taxes. Some investments may be made in currencies     
other than the U.S. dollar that will fluctuate in value as a result of changes  
in the currency exchange rate.                                                  

HEDGING STRATEGIES Use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, currency 
or index futures or other derivatives involves risks. The contracts may increase
the Account's volatility and, thus, could involve a significant risk. If the    
Sub-Advisor's predictions are inaccurate, the averse consequences to the        
Account(e.g., a reduction in the Account's net asset value) may leave the       
Account in a worse position than if these strategies were not used.             

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS ("IPOS") The Account's purchase of shares issued in    
IPOs exposes it to the additional risks associated with companies that have     
little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent  
in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate. The market for  
IPO issuers has been volatile and share prices of certain newly-public companies
have fluctuated in significant amounts over short periods of time. In addition, 
the Sub-Advisor cannot guarantee continued access to IPO offerings, and may at  
times dispose of those shares shortly after their acquisition.                  

INTEREST RATE CHANGES The value of fixed-income securities held by the Account  
may be affected by factors such as changing interest rates, credit rating, and  
effective maturities. When interest rates fall, the price of a bond rises and   
when interest rates rise, the price declines.                                   

P-->4979th�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
CREDIT RISK Lower quality and longer maturity bonds will be subject to greater  
credit risk and price fluctuations than higher quality and shorter maturity     
bonds. Bonds held by the Account may be affected by unfavorable political,      
economic, or governmental developments that could affect the repayment of       
principal or the payment of interest.                                           

HIGH YIELD SECURITIES Fixed-income securities that are not investment grade are 
commonly referred to as junk bonds or high yield securities. These securities   
offer a higher yield than other, higher rated securities, but they carry a      
greater degree of risk and are considered speculative by the major credit rating
agencies. (please see High Yield Securities in the section of the Prospectus    
entitled CERTAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND RELATED RISKS)                       

U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED SECURITIES The Account may invest in debt and         
mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises such as   
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage       
Association and the Federal Home Loan Banks. Although the issuing agency,       
instrumentality or corporation maybe chartered or sponsored by the United States
government, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the United    
States Treasury.                                                                

INVESTOR PROFILE                                                                
The Fund may be an appropriate investment for investors expecting to retire     
around the year 2030 or fund a cashflow need in the year 2030.                  

UNDERLYING FUND ALLOCATION

price you paid, you will lose                                                   
money.                                                                          

As with any security, the securities in which the underlying funds invest have  
associated risks. These include risks of:                                       

STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY The net asset value of the Account's shares is effected 
by changes in the value of the securities it owns. The prices of equity         
securities held by the Account may decline in response to certain events        
including those directly involving issuers of these securities, adverse         
conditions affecting the general economy, or overall market declines. In the    
short term, stock prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these        
factors.                                                                        

SMALL AND MEDIUM CAPITALIZATIONS Companies with small capitalizations are often 
companies with a limited operation history. Such companies may have been created
in response to cultural, economic, regulatory or technological developments.    
Such developments can have significant impact or negative effect on smaller     
capitalization companies securities which may be more volatile in price than    
larger company securities, especially over the short-term.                      

FOREIGN INVESTING Foreign markets and currencies may not perform as well as U.S.
markets. Political and economic uncertainty in foreign countries, as well as    
less public information about foreign investments may negatively impact the     
Account's portfolio. Dividends and other income payable on foreign securities   
may be subject to foreign taxes. Some investments may be made in currencies     
other than the U.S. dollar that will fluctuate in value as a result of changes  
in the currency exchange rate.

HEDGING STRATEGIES Use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, currency 
or index futures or other derivatives involves risks. The contracts may increase
the Account's volatility and, thus, could involve a significant risk. If the    
Sub-Advisor's predictions are inaccurate, the averse consequences to the        
Account(e.g., a reduction in the Account's net asset value) may leave the       
Account in a worse position than if these strategies were not used.             

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS ("IPOS") The Account's purchase of shares issued in    
IPOs exposes it to the additional risks associated with companies that have     
little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent  
in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate. The market for  
IPO issuers has been volatile and share prices of certain newly-public companies
have fluctuated in significant amounts over short periods of time. In addition, 
the Sub-Advisor cannot guarantee continued access to IPO offerings, and may at  
times dispose of those shares shortly after their acquisition.                  

FIXED-INCOME RISKS 
.. Interest rate changes. The value of fixed-income securities held by the      
Account may be affected by factors such as changing interest rates, credit  
rating, and effective maturities. When interest rates fall, the price of a  
bond rises and when interest rates rise, the price declines.                
.. Credit risk. Lower quality and longer maturity bonds will be subject to      
greater credit risk and price fluctuations than higher quality and shorter  
maturity bonds. Bonds held by the Account may be affected by unfavorable    
political, economic, or governmental developments that could affect the     
repayment of principal or the payment of interest.                          
.. High yield securities. Fixed-income securities that are not investment grade 
are commonly referred to as junk bonds or high yield securities. These      
 securities offer a higher yield than other, higher rated securities, but they
carry a greater degree of risk and are considered speculative by the major  
credit rating agencies. (please see High Yield Securities in the section of 
the Prospectus entitled CERTAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND RELATED RISKS)    
.. U.S. Government Sponsored Securities. The Account may invest in debt and     
 mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises such as
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage   
Association and the Federal Home Loan Banks. Although the issuing agency,   
instrumentality or corporation maybe chartered or sponsored by the United   
States government, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the
United States Treasury.

The Fund may be an appropriate investment for investors expecting to retire     
around the year 2040 or fund a cashflow need in the year 2040.                  

UNDERLYING FUND ALLOCATION                                                      
Principal anticipates initially allocating Account assets among the underlying  
funds as follows:

Based on this allocation, the weighted average of the total account operating   
expenses of the underlying funds is 0.66%. The combined total expenses for the  
Account may be higher or lower depending on the allocation of its assets among  
the underlying funds.

 TOTAL ACCOUNT OPERATING EXPENSES         0.35                                                                                  
 The Manager has voluntarily agreed to reimburse operating expenses so that the total Account operating expenses will not be    
 greater than 0.14% through April 30, 2005. The Manager may not continue this arrangement after May 1, 2005.                    
 The Account as a shareholder in the underlying funds, indirectly bears its pro rata share of the operating expenses incurred by
 each underlying fund. As of December 31, 2003, the operating expenses of the underlying funds ranged from 0.39% to 1.84%. The  
 Account's investment return is net of the underlying funds' operating expenses.                                                

EXAMPLES                                                                      
 The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the Account for the time periods
indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The 
Examples also assume that your investment has a 5% return each year and that  
the Account's operating expenses remain the same. If the operating expenses of
the underlying funds, separate account expenses and contract level expenses   
were included, expenses would be higher. Although your actual costs may be    
higher or lower, based on these assumptions your cost would be:

PRINCIPAL LIFETIME 2050 ACCOUNT                                                 
The Account seeks a total return consisting of long-term growth of capital and  
current income.                                                                 

MAIN STRATEGIES                                                                 
To pursue its goal, the Account invests in shares of other Principal Variable   
Contracts Fund Accounts (the "underlying funds"). The underlying funds are      
intended to give the Account broad exposure to the domestic and foreign equity  
and fixed-income markets. At any time, the Sub-Advisor, Principal, may add or   
substitute underlying funds in which the Account invests.                       

Over time, shifts in the allocations to the underlying funds will be designed to
accommodate investors progressing from asset accumulation years to              
income-generation years; shifts in the underlying fund allocations may also     
occur when market forces change allocations in ways the Sub-Advisor, Principal, 
considers likely to help the Account achieve its investment objective.          

In deciding how to allocation the Account's assets among the underlying funds at
any time, Principal considers long-term asset class returns, volatility         
assumptions and the Account's target time horizon. There are no minimum or      
maximum percentages in which the Account must invest in any underlying fund. As 
the Account primarily invests in underlying funds that invest in equity         
securities (see table below), the primarily risks of the Account are those      
associated with stock funds. The Account also invests in fixed-income underlying
funds. At any time, Principal may add or substitute underlying funds in which   
the Account invests.                                                            

Principal intends to gradually shift the Account's allocation among the         
underlying funds so that within five to ten years after the year 2050, the      
Account's underlying fund allocation matches the underlying fund allocation of  
the Principal LifeTime Strategic Income Account, an Account that invests        
primarily in fixed-income securities. At that time, the Account may be combined 
with the Principal LifeTime Strategic Income Account. The Board of Directors    
would need to determine at the time of the proposed combination that the        
combining of the Accounts is in the best interests of the Accounts'             
shareholders. If the Board determines that the proposed combination is          
appropriate, it will seek: 1) an order of substitution from the Securities and  
Exchange Commission; 2) submit the issue to a vote of the shareholders; 3) or a 
combination of both 1 and 2.                                                    

MAIN RISKS                                                                      
The Account's investments are concentrated in the underlying funds and, as a    
result, the Account's performance is directly related to their performance. The 
Account's ability to meet its investment objective                              

P-->49713th�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�13th
depends on the ability of the underlying funds to achieve their investment      
objectives. Consequently, the Account is subject to the particular risks of the 
underlying funds in the proportions in which the Account invests in them. As    
with all mutual funds, as the values of the Account's assets rise or fall, the  
Account's                                                                       
share price changes. If you sell your shares when their value is less than the  
price you paid, you will lose                                                   
money.                                                                          

As with any security, the securities in which the underlying funds invest have  
associated risks. These include risks of:

                                          ----                                                                                  
 TOTAL ACCOUNT OPERATING EXPENSES         0.54                                                                                  
 The Manager has voluntarily agreed to reimburse operating expenses so that the total Account operating expenses will not be    
 greater than 0.13% through April 30, 2005. The Manager may not continue this arrangement after May 1, 2005.                    
 The Account as a shareholder in the underlying funds, indirectly bears its pro rata share of the operating expenses incurred by
 each underlying fund. As of December 31, 2003, the operating expenses of the underlying funds ranged from 0.39% to 1.84%. The  
 Account's investment return is net of the underlying funds' operating expenses.                                                

EXAMPLES                                                                      
 The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the Account for the time periods
indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The 
Examples also assume that your investment has a 5% return each year and that  
the Account's operating expenses remain the same. If the operating expenses of
the underlying funds, separate account expenses and contract level expenses   
were included, expenses would be higher. Although your actual costs may be    
higher or lower, based on these assumptions your cost would be:

PRINCIPAL LIFETIME 2050 ACCOUNT                                                $55   $174  $303  $680                  

PRINCIPAL LIFETIME STRATEGIC INCOME ACCOUNT                                     
The Account seeks high current income.                                          

MAIN STRATEGIES                                                                 
To pursue its goal, the Account invests in shares of other Principal Variable   
Contracts Fund Accounts (the "underlying funds"). The underlying funds are      
intended to give the Account moderate exposure to the domestic and foreign      
equity and fixed-income markets. At any time, the Sub-Advisor, Principal, may   
add or substitute underlying funds in which the Account invests.                

In deciding how to allocate the Account's assets among the underlying funds at  
any time, Principal considers long-term asset class returns and volatility      
assumptions.As the Account invests primarily in underlying funds that invest in 
fixed-income securities (see table below), the Account is subject to the risk of
interest rate changes and credit risks associated with fixed-income securities. 
The Account may also invest in underlying funds which invest primarily in equity
securities.

MAIN RISKS                                                                      
The Account's investments are concentrated in the underlying funds and, as a    
result, the Account's performance is directly related to their performance. The 
Account's ability to meet its investment objective depends on the ability of the
underlying funds to achieve their investment objectives. Consequently, the      
Account is subject to the particular risks of the underlying funds in the       
proportions in which the Account invests in them. As with all mutual funds, as  
the values of the Account's assets rise or fall, the Account's                  
share price changes. If you sell your shares when their value is less than the  
price you paid, you will lose                                                   
money.                                                                          

As with any security, the securities in which the underlying funds invest have  
associated risks. These include risks of:                                       

INTEREST RATE CHANGES The value of fixed-income securities held by the Account  
may be affected by factors such as changing interest rates, credit rating, and  
effective maturities. When interest rates fall, the price of a bond rises and   
when interest rates rise, the price declines.                                   

CREDIT RISK Lower quality and longer maturity bonds will be subject to greater  
credit risk and price fluctuations than higher quality and shorter maturity     
bonds. Bonds held by the Account may be affected by unfavorable political,      
economic, or governmental developments that could affect the repayment of       
principal or the payment of interest.                                           

HIGH YIELD SECURITIES Fixed-income securities that are not investment grade are 
commonly referred to as junk bonds or high yield securities. These securities   
offer a higher yield than other, higher rated securities, but they carry a      
greater degree of risk and are considered speculative by the major credit rating
agencies. (please see High Yield Securities in the section of the Prospectus    
entitled CERTAIN INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND RELATED RISKS).                      

U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED SECURITIES The Account may invest in debt and         
mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises such as   
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage       
Association and the Federal Home Loan Banks. Although the issuing agency,       
instrumentality or corporation maybe chartered or sponsored by the United States
government, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the United    
States Treasury.                                                                

EQUITY SECURITY RISKS                                                           
.. Stock market volatility. The net asset value of the underlying fund shares is
effected by changes in the value of the securities it owns. The prices of   
equity securities may decline in response to certain events including those 
directly involving issuers of these securities, adverse conditions affecting
the general economy, or overall market declines. In the short term, stock   
prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these factors.             
.. Foreign investing.Foreign markets and currencies may not perform as well as  
U.S. markets. Political and economic uncertainty in foreign countries may   
negatively impact the portfolio. Some investments may be made in currencies 
  other than the U.S. dollar that will fluctuate in value as a result of changes
in the currency exchange rate.                                              
.. Small and Medium Capitalizations. Companies with small capitalizations are   
often companies with a limited operation history. Smaller capitalization    
companies securities may be more volatile in price than larger company      
securities, especially over the short-term.                                 
.. Hedging strategies. Use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts,      
currency or index futures or other derivatives involves risks.              
.. Initial Public Offerings ("IPOs"). Purchase of shares issued in IPOs exposes 
  an underlying fund to the additional risks associated with companies that have
  little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent
in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate.             

INVESTOR PROFILE                                                                
The Fund may be an appropriate investment for investors in retirement.

UNDERLYING FUND ALLOCATION                                                      
Principal anticipates initially allocating Account assets among the underlying  
funds as follows:                                                               

                                                                [Download Table]

                                                                     
Bond                       31.0%    LargeCap Value               5.5%
Capital Value               3.0     LargeCap Stock Index        10.5 
Equity Growth               3.1     Money Market                19.3 
Equity Income               7.2     Real Estate Securities       9.5 
Growth                      3.1     SmallCap                     2.8 
International               5.0                                      

Based on this allocation, the weighted average of the total account operating   
expenses of the underlying funds is 0.59%. The combined total expenses for the  
Account may be higher or lower depending on the allocation of its assets among  
the underlying funds.                                                           

As the inception date of the Account is August 30, 2004, historical performance 
data is not available.                                                          

FEES AND EXPENSES (ESTIMATED) AS A % OF AVERAGE DAILY NET ASSETS                
(These fees and expenses do not include the effect of any sales charge, separate
account expenses or other contract level expenses which may be applied at the   
variable life insurance or variable annuity product level. If such charges or   
                                 -
fees were included, overall expenses would be higher and would lower the        
Account's performance.)

Short and Sharp: The twisted relationship between central banks and inflation

Investors currently face the challenge of the Federal Reserve’s belief that monetary policy needs to be tightened, despite missing inflationary pressures. This is not just a U.S. phenomenon, it’s a global one. In the euro-area, core inflation remains stubbornly low, yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely gearing up to announce its tapering plans.

Know Thyself:  Socratic Thoughts on Defined Benefit Fee Policy Statements

I’m not sure what this says about me, but every time someone mentions Socrates, I think of Steve Martin’s depiction of the ancient philosopher in his 1980 TV special Steve Martin: Comedy is Not Pretty. (“…And not once did anyone ever say: ‘Socrates, hemlock is poison!’”) In real life, Socrates usually said things much smarter

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Term life insurance
that keeps on giving.

With Lifely Term, your family will receive monthly payments for a term you choose, up to 30 years.
These steady payments can help your family manage their budget, much like your paycheck does now.
 
Here’s an example of how Lifely Term can work.





Meet Alex Age: 34 Married w/2 kids




Where Alex fits in 
Right now, Alex is the sole earner. If he were to pass away tomorrow, he would need to provide around 20 years of financial support.




Income $70/k a year




Life without Alex 
Alex’s family needs $4k a month to manage the bills so that his wife can continue to care for the kids as planned.




Goal To support his family after he’s gone. Alex wants to provide enough to pay the mortgage and everyday expenses until the children are out of school.




How Lifely Term can help 
With Lifely Term, Alex can provide $4k a month for 20 years, to help support his family during what would have been his working years.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
