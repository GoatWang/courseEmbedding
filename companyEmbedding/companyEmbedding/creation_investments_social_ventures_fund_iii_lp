Welcome
Maximizing Financial and Social Impact Returns














Creating Opportunities. Creating Wealth.
Creation Investments Capital Management, LLC is a leading alternative investment management company with a focus on private equity investments in Microfinance Institutions, Small-and-Medium Enterprise lenders, Emerging Market Banks, and other BOP Financial Services Providers. Named a leading Impact Investment fund manager by ImpactAssets50 again in 2016, Creation Investments currently manages several private funds and other investment vehicles for individual, family office and institutional investors. Together with our portfolio companies, we provide access to capital and needed products and services for those living in poverty to engage in small-business activity and income generation, significantly impacting those living at the bottom of the economic pyramid. Currently, our companies directly serve over 10 million entrepreneurs with over $7 billion in small business loans outstanding, and millions more with micro-savings, micro-insurance and mobile payment tools. We seek to maximize financial and social returns on investment, creating significant wealth for all of our stakeholders, especially our end clients.
Not Giving. Investing.
Trillions of dollars have been transferred to the poor in the last 50 years in charitable giving and services. Yet, poverty persists and billions of people go without daily basic human needs. While charitable giving is critical, alone it has not and will not break the cycle of poverty. When the poor are given access to capital and other financial products such as savings or insurance, communities are changed as capital is used for sustainable, economically beneficial activity.
Not only do these kinds of investments provide an economic return, they are a critical part of social transformation, giving dignity through work and empowerment to men and women of all socioeconomic classes. Calling upon market principles, we believe that investing, not giving only, has the potential to help solve this daunting world crisis.  Creation Investments employs a for-profit model seeking to outperform direct charity socially as well as the broader market for our investors.
Not Socially Responsible. Socially Active Investments.
Socially responsible investments have experienced tremendous growth in the past five years, attracting trillions from institutions and individuals who care about impact not just profit. Yet, there is a significant difference between being socially responsible and socially active – the former focuses on the avoidance of harm whereas the later is concerned with positive social impact.
Socially responsible investments avoid dumping pollutants into lakes and streams. Socially active investments sponsor clean water projects. Socially responsible investments prohibit predatory lending. Socially active investments offer the poor access to capital to start businesses. Socially responsible investments filter out companies involved in arms and narcotics dealings. Socially active investments provide needed medication to those in the bottom of the pyramid.
Creation Investments seeks to address the needs of the BOP through supporting sustainable, socially active ventures with other like-minded, social entrepreneurs who desire to invest with purpose.  While every investment we make involves negative screens on social and environmental practices, our portfolio companies proactively address social issues through profitable business operations.

About Us














About Us
Our experienced team of global investment professionals with over 60 years of combined international finance expertise work from our headquarters in Chicago. The breadth and depth of our team helps us identify and evaluate new investment opportunities on a global basis. Our investment team is responsible for leading the daily activities of the firm, including evaluating, structuring, and negotiating new investment opportunities, and working closely with the management teams of our portfolio companies to build value through a variety of initiatives.
.
The combination of strength-based team roles and global expertise are a hallmark of Creation Investments. Building on years of shared industry experience, our investment professionals’ deep knowledge of the capital markets around the world and long-term relationships with social venture leaders are critical to our success.  Click on Investment Team and Advisory Board for short biographies of all involved.
 
Core Principles
Creation Investments seeks to offer investors a double bottom line, maximizing financial and social returns on investment. We do so by being focused on for-profit investments that directly benefit those living in poverty, compassionate in how we treat people, balanced in how we make decisions, and responsible in operating our businesses.  We desire to promote healthy stewardship of the world’s resources and authentic generosity among those with whom we do business.
We believe that our fiduciary role involves a duty to act in the best long-term interests of our stakeholders and that our adherence to Environmental, Social, and Corporate governance (ESG) best practices will positively affect the performance of our investment portfolios. We are active owners and incorporate the following principles in accordance with ESG  into our ownership policies and practices.  Creation Investments has adopted the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, the UN Principles for Investors in Inclusive Finance, and the Smart Campaign/Client Protection Principles. Given this focus and commitment, Creation Investments was recognized as a top Impact Investment manager by ImpactAssets in 2011.

Focused
Creation Investments is focused on international poverty reduction and eradication through direct investment in sustainable social ventures. We do not involve ourselves in political lobbying or action, but rather private markets to achieve these goals. We connect social enterprises to investor groups, mobilizing capital to create lasting change in developing economies.
We strive to provide creative and flexible capital structures in a manner that addresses the goals of our strategic partners and our shareholders. Through our investments, our strategic partners are able to accelerate growth and fund new initiatives, enabling them to expand their outreach. We will not finance organizations that involve themselves in predatory or usurious lending or other practices which have deleterious effects on individuals, the environment, or communities.
Creation Investments seeks to maximize value, both financial and social, for all of our stakeholders. Investments will be structured to achieve the greatest social and economic yields. Given our fiduciary responsibility to our investors, we aim to meet shareholder expectations through consistent financial and social returns. We will perform thorough due-diligence on all partners to ensure a shared vision, operational rigor, and commitment to excellence.
Compassionate
Creation Investments does not see those living in poverty as a market to be exploited. These people are brothers and sisters whom we are trying to serve as valued stakeholders. We will be a compassionate organization that helps to meet the tangible needs of people within the communities which we operate. Our heart for the poor will show itself in structuring investments which provide critical products and services to help break the cycle of poverty.
We are committed to promoting social awareness and activism in its various forms. We believe that investing should be included in the continuum of social activism, as capital can be mobilized to alleviate suffering and eradicate poverty. To this end, we facilitate education and new avenues for involvement.
We strive to create a working environment in which individuals can use their gifts, talents, and skills to their fullest. We will promote healthy work-life balance and a culture of fairness, incentive, and opportunity.
Balanced
Creation Investments equally weights financial and social returns on investment. Investment selection and other strategic decisions will be guided by a desire to maximize both social and financial returns. We will not sacrifice one for the other.  We will not make investments that do not target both market rate economic returns and robust social returns.
We believe that particular impact investments have aligned financial and social goals, where both bottom lines are mutually reinforcing not mutually exclusive.  We believe that our focus on social returns will reinforce and enhance our long-term economic returns, and vice versa.
We actively monitor financial and social returns on investment (FROI and SROI respectively).  We require effective financial and social performance management tools and timely reporting in all of our portfolio companies.
For all of our employees, we strive to create a working environment in which individuals can use their gifts, talents, and skills to their fullest.  We will promote healthy work-life balance and a culture of fairness, incentive, and opportunity.
Responsible
We are responsible to all of our stakeholders which include our investors and strategic partners, suppliers and contractors, authorities and regulators, the countries, communities and ecosystems where we do business, the employees who give our organization its strength, others with an interest in social activism, and our end clients.
We perform negative and positive screens on all of our prospective investments, and require our portfolio companies to sign on to our business code of conduct and ethics statements. We will not finance organizations or lend through our portfolio companies to:

Predatory or usurious lending institutions
Businesses involved in alcohol, tobacco, narcotics, gambling, or weapons
Entities with unsustainable or environmentally deleterious production methods

We believe these are poor business practices and will lead to deterioration of both financial and social returns.

In addition to adopting he UN Principles for Responsible Investment and UN Principles for Investors in Inclusive Finance, we are a member of the Smart Campaign and endorse the six client protection principles:

Avoidance of Over-Indebtedness
Transparent and Responsible Pricing
Appropriate Collections Practices
Ethical Staff Behavior
Mechanisms for Redress of Grievances
Privacy of Client Data

We are committed to being open and transparent about our business practices, investments and strategic partner relationships. We communicate regularly to investors and other stakeholders through a variety of media, always including detail on the financial performance and social impact of our investments.
Creation Investments will maintain a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the organization’s risk management policies, aims and objectives.  Specific board oversight is given to the Corporate Governance and Audit Committee for regular reviews of the systems effectiveness.  We will look for similar standards of transparency and control when selecting our strategic partners, investment projects and vendors.
Stewardship & Generosity
Creation Investments encourages the use of our resources, including our time, treasure, and talent, for the greater good.  We espouse stewardship and generosity, and seek to pass along these values to our stakeholders.  While we firmly believe capitalism and business can be used as tools, there are other aspects of holistic poverty relief that do not have a business model and require donor funding to meet the pressing needs of the poor. Our not-for-profit efforts seek to facilitate further generosity and address the other, numerous aspects of holistic poverty relief that cannot be achieved through our investment portfolio.

Impact Investing














Impact Investing
Impact investments or transformational investments aim to solve social or environmental challenges while generating financial profit. Impact investing includes investments that range from producing a return of principal capital to offering market-rate or even market-beating financial returns. Although impact investing could be categorized as a type of “socially responsible investing,” it contrasts with negative screening, which focuses primarily on avoiding investments in “bad” or “harmful” companies – impact investors actively seek to place capital in businesses and funds that can harness the positive power of enterprise.
.
A rapidly growing supply of capital is seeking placement in impact investments across geographies, sectors, and asset classes, with a wide range of return expectations. The glue that binds those who operate in the impact investing industry is the shared conviction that creative investments can play a crucial part in addressing social and environmental challenges. This investment interest is sparking the emergence of a new industry that operates in the largely uncharted area between philanthropy and a singular focus on profit-maximization.
.
Despite the challenging economic environment, the impact investing industry continues to manifest itself in a wide range of innovations and entrepreneurial activities around the world:

Private equity funds that aim to provide growth capital profitably to businesses that provide social services are proliferating and expanding access, for example, to education, better healthcare, and decent housing for poor people around the world.
Clients of leading private banks and pension funds are calling on their investment managers to offer impact investment options.
Prominent family offices are actively seeking investment partnerships that can help them source, vet, and execute impact investment deals in sectors ranging from sustainable agriculture to healthcare to urban infrastructure.
Private foundations are seeking to partner with investment banks and development finance institutions to make impact investments in areas related to their social missions, utilizing program related investments (PRIs) or mission related investments (MRIs).

.
The impact investing industry has the potential to steer significant sums of money to market-based solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges, including sustainable agriculture, affordable housing, affordable and accessible healthcare, clean technology, and financial services for the poor. Creation Investments is a leader in the Impact Investing industry.

SMEs: The Missing Middle














SMEs: The Missing Middle
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), typically employing  between 10 and 250 workers, form the backbone of modern economies and  can be crucial engines of development through their role as efficient producers, innovators and employers. Generally, these businesses operate in areas with high concentrations of poverty and may employ those living in poverty or provide needed products and services, assisting in raising the standard of living. Many economists believe that economic development is advanced through the proliferation of SMEs because such proliferation increases employment opportunities in developing economies.  In much of the developing world, though, SMEs are  under-represented,  stifled by regulatory climates and poor  access to inputs, in particular  financial capital.
.
Over the past 30 years, micro-enterprises have received the bulk of the attention and capital.  Nevertheless, SMEs cannot be neglected as they represent an important part of true economic growth.  Lending to SMEs has a substantial impact, creating real, sustainable jobs for the bottom of the pyramid, have improved economies of scale allowing them to compete more effectively, and providing owners with opportunities to build assets and wealth, beyond income augmentation and smoothing.
.
But the type of support inherent to microfinance  lending is generally ill-adapted to serving their slightly larger, and  arguably more dynamic, cousins, the SMEs. New options are emerging for meeting SMEs’ financial needs,  including commercial banks moving “down-market,” micro-credit  institutions moving “up,” and creative application of venture capital  investing ideas.
.
Traditional microfinance models have helped  provide basic financial services to hundreds of millions.  But in  order to help build dynamic competitive economies in developing  countries, the time has come to pay greater attention to the potential  of small and medium-sized commercial firms to promote economic growth.  Although SMEs differ from micro-enterprises, investments in both types of entities provide similar and complementary poverty reduction and economic development opportunities.
.
Creation Investments is active in evaluating and pursuing investments in the SME Lending space as a means of achieving superior  financial and  social returns on investment.

Microfinance














Access to Capital, Inclusive Finance, & Microfinance
Microfinance refers to the providing of basic financial services to the poor, particularly in developing countries, providing underbanked and unbanked populations with access to capital and other financial products (including micro-savings, FX/remittance services, debit and credit cards, and micro-insurance). Also known as Inclusive Finance, Microfinance first came to prominence in the 1980s, although early experiments in microfinance began over 30 years ago in Bangladesh, Brazil, and a few other countries. Most notably, Mohammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Microfinance and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, has helped to propel microfinance into the mainstream. Micro-credit is widely regarded as an essential tool for furthering economic development in developing countries and has proven to be one of the most effective and flexible strategies in the fight against global poverty. It is sustainable, and can be implemented upon a massive scale.
.

Micro-credit, a key area of microfinance, refers to the making of small loans, usually US $200 or less, to poor persons, usually women, in developing economic areas. These loans are made to help those living in poverty establish or expand self-sustaining businesses. The loans help the poor generate and increase income, providing them with stability for their families, opportunities for education, and protection from externalities. Assisting these entrepreneurs found and grow businesses imparts human dignity and social status, transforming them into producers and participants in their society. Although many factors contribute to global poverty, local moneylenders charge rates of interest upwards of 100% perpetuating the state of poverty for the working poor. Micro-credit offers access to cheaper capital and is powerful instrument for self-empowerment, enabling the poor, especially women, to break the cycle of poverty.
.
Micro-credit loans are typically made to individuals who do not have access to formal financial institutions and who are self-employed, often household-based, entrepreneurs. In rural areas, they are usually small farmers and others who are engaged in small income-generating activities, such as food processing and petty trade. In urban areas, micro-credit recipients are more diverse, and include shopkeepers, service providers, artisans, small manufacturers, and street vendors.
.
Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) are entities that provide financial services, including such loans, to the very poor assisting this sector of the population. Most MFIs are non-profit institutions, with many MFIs affiliated with faith-based NGOs. Recently, reflecting a maturing of the microfinance industry, certain MFIs have organized themselves as commercial, for-profit institutions.
MFIs, both non-profit and commercial, have proven to engage in microfinance on a profitable basis, with industry average ROEs at 12%.  The best microfinance institutions have ROAs that range between 5% and 15%. Loan default rates for micro-credit loans made in developing countries are slightly higher than 1%, besting loan default rates for the largest domestic financial institutions.  In addition, several studies have shown that social impact is highly correlated to profitability.  With larger scale, lower interest rates, and additional financial products and services, the most profitable MFIs have received the highest social impact scores and metrics, revealing the mutual reinforcement of financial and social returns.

The almost 8,000 MFIs currently service nearly 170 million clients worldwide, equating to $50 billion in assets. This level of service manages to meet approximately 10% of global demand for micro-credit. The total annual demand for micro-credit is estimated at $300 billion, with an estimated annual growth grate of 15% to 30%. In this environment, the largest and most sustainable MFIs are growing at a rate of between 30% and 70% per year, and many smaller institutions are growing at a faster rate.
.
Traditionally, MFIs have obtained the capital for their lending activities through government grants and private donations. As the microfinance market has grown, these traditional sources of funding have proved to be inadequate to finance the growing demand for micro-credit. Many MFIs now are attempting to obtain capital from financial markets.
Creation Investments is active in evaluating and pursuing investments in the Microfinance space as a means of achieving superior financial and social returns on investment.
