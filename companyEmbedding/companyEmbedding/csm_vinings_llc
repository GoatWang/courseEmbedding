Negative side:1-When you are signing the contract make sure you write whatever you talked about.  The owner mentioned at least 5 times, they will bring 5% food in addition to our total guests, and then they pack the leftovers; it did not happen and it was very disappointing. After the guests finished their dinner all the dishes were full of kebab, chicken kebab, stews, salads, different kind of rice and whatever was in our menu.  The next day we were so shocked to see they have just packed bread, herbs, half of the box egg plant appetizer and plain rice. Flavor café simply blamed the hotel. After our investigation, we found out the manager of the restaurant picked all the good stuff with him. Couple weeks later my friend had the same experience on her private party at her house. I would really like to know what they do with all those food the next day. 2-When we were shopping around the other restaurants told us upfront, after the party we have to pay between $20 to $50 tips to each server. Flavor café did not mention anything, and then asked for 20% tip (of our check).  In our case it was $200 tip for each server and $800 in total.  3-We were discussed so many times what kind of flavor we want for our cake, the owner tried his best to change our mind and finally he agreed to make what we were asking for. Guess what, he made what he was trying to force us to agree on from the beginning. 4-We had so much cake leftover as well and what we got was just the top part of cake and they took the rest.5-The other night we took our guests from out of town there although, there were only one other family beside us and the food was great; the service was not caring and good.  B Beatty Bakery Diner & Cafechelen ratedSo I work two doors down from ...So I work two doors down from this restaurant and I've been eagerly anticipating it's opening ever since they first posted their menu in the window. (By eagerly anticipating, I mean stalking. Seriously, it got pretty bad)They're finally open and I had my first meal there today. I was a little worried that it wouldn't live up to the hype that I was building in my head, but it definitely did. First of all, the menu is quite extensive. They have everything from chicken & waffles to hand-cut fries to baked goods to fresh fruit flavored lemonades to build-your-own-crepes (which is what I chose, along with the sweet potato blood orange souffle). Tons of options for vegetarians as well (something I'm accidentally conscious of because of my pretentious trendy vegetarian brother)The food was great. There are no frilly menu options here, so if you're looking for foods that are impossible to pronounce, this isn't the place. Just simple, but delicious, southern-inspired cuisine.The waitstaff was friendly.So overall, I would say that my first experience at B. Beatty was definitely all I hoped for, and I am so thankful for this place being open 2 doors down from where I work. I anticipate most of my check will be going here.OH. I almost forgot. Speaking of checks, the food was ridiculously underpriced. Yes, UNDERPRICED. My boyfriend and I have no idea how they're pulling off this menu with the prices they're charging but maybe I won't be spending my whole check in here after all.Definitely check it out.Sprinkles CupcakesIris L. ratedSprinkle's in my opinion is usually a hit or miss. Maybe it is just my preference, but their are items which I really love and some that I just do not care for. My go to favs are usually the salted corn flake cookie, strawberry ice cream, captain crunch ice cream, and definitely the smore's cupcake! If I were to narrow it down some more I would have to say that the smore's and cookie are my top 2. You MUST try it at least once. They both feature a sweet and salty aspect, which I love because sometimes eating something just sweet can become pretty boring. The service here is usually a hit or miss too. Sometimes you might get exceptional and friendly service, while other times you might receive service from someone who does not want to be there. Nevertheless, I still have a place for Sprinkles and will be going back whenever I get a sweet-salty craving.Alon's Bakery & Market at Park PlaceAbby B. ratedIf you're all about indie and gourmet foods, here is a place of significance. The fromage and fruit preserves are endless. The best selection I've seen in the metropolitan. My Israeli breakfast included two types of cheese (cheddar and goat cheese), dayum it's the creamiest cheeses I've tasted! The jams were seedless and smooth spread; country French bread was thin and fresh.The groceries are somewhat pricey but if artisanal and organic appeals to you, the price is not questionable because the quality is worth it. The staff is pretty knowledgeable and friendly, and they're happy to give samples and product info. There's no wait to be seated, plus food service is speedy. I love this place for a quick snack or meal. Moreover, the foods are guilt free. You'll be impressed if you're interested in all natural everything.Sweet CheatsGia E. ratedSweet Cheats is no less than bomb.com! I have no problem squeezing through the narrow streets of Cabbagetown to indulge in their yummy treats. My favorite are the macarons! The flavors rotate daily. My best is the strawberry macaron! What's also great about sweet Cheats is that they do custom orders. They've done a few custom cakes and cupcakes for my catering events at the Georgia Dome. My favorite was the Drum Corps International trophy cake. Not only was it amazing visually but the crème brulee flavor of the cake was to die for. Their cakes have a signature taste that is unlike any other bakery. Our clients loved it. The owner Shirley is really nice and dedicated to her work. She's produced amazing desserts for me a couple of times with only two days notice!Urban Land CruisersJason T. ratedI've purchased parts from Dave and the crew at ULC and ULR (Urban Land Rovers) for nearly 4 years now. Dave was so helpful I decided to have him do a full restoration on one of my vehicles. The work has taken a bit longer then planned but with a bit of patience the progress has been steady and the truck looks amazing today.First of all let me say how much the shop has changed in the past few years. Its gone from a small Land Cruiser Shop to one of the largest suppliers of new and used Land Rover parts in the South East.I would not hesitate to recommend ULC to anyone looking for the best in parts and vehicle sales. Call Dave (or even better email him) for some of the most knowledgeable and honest advice anywhere; 5 starsButtermilk Sky Pie ShopIris L. ratedFirst off, what a cute and sweet looking place. We were greeted by a sweet grandma that informed us about their pies and how they make it. I choose the pecan pie, which was delicious and a must when you are in the south. We then asked about the various empty bottles that were displayed and she told us that they bottle their own milk. I REPEAT, they BOTTLE their milk. Apparently, they do this because they like to keep their milk at a low 30 degrees. What pairs better than ice cold milk with a delicious pie? Everything about the place is absolutely adorable and truly exemplifies southern hospitality. I will definitely be back when I get a chance to have their delicious pies and milk!Evan's Bake Shopsonya.weaver.7 ratedI love Evan's key lime cake..........I first experienced their scrumptious cake at a J.R.Cricket's.  They were sooooooo delicious to me, I started to go there just for the cakes. Low and behold, I saw the car displaying their cake in East Point, but I couldn't write down the number fast enough. Low and behold again, after eating in East Point, me and a companion decided to take a stroll through downtown EastPoint. It was during our stroll that I told my companion how I wish I could go to J.R.Cricket's to get a piece of cake. In our walking, we literally came upon the bake shop in downtown East Point!!!!! Talk about happy!!!!!!! Yes, I've found the best key lime cake in Georgia thus far!!! ����������������Proof BakeshopDave D. ratedWalked over for a ginger-cranberry scone ($2.50) and a smallish cup of coffee ($2.50). Tax & tip made it $6. Delightfully sunny, open atmosphere & counter service.There may be scones as good elsewhere but I promise you there are none better. Also, the coffee was nirvana, in a coffee kind of way. Two thumbs way up on the food.But pricey! In Proof's defense, I'll admit I did not ask for a refill on the coffee. But for that price you can get a cup twice as big and just as good in Little Five.CamicakesCandyce V. ratedThere hasn't been a time when I've been here and there hasn't been a line out of the door. These cupcakes are addicting. My former boss ordered some for me for my birthday, and I found myself trying to make excuses to go to the shop and buy more. You can't go wrong with any of the flavors.There's a location with a creamery in Vinings, but I'm afraid that will feed even deeper into my addiction so I still haven't visited yet. It's such a really cute shop and the logo is adorable.
