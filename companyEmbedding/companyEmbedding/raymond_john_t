Early life[edit]
John grew up in the Queens neighborhood of Hollis.[4] An only child, John was raised by his mother and grandfather. Early jobs included handing out flyers and waiting tables at Red Lobster.[5] He attended Bayside High School.[6] In high school, he participated in a program that allowed him to work a full-time job and attend school on an alternating weekly basis, which he credits with instilling an entrepreneurial spirit.[7] After graduating high school, he started a commuter van service.[4]
Career[edit]
FUBU[edit]
When Daymond John first had the idea for a clothing company for young men, his mother taught him how to sew and supported him by allowing her house to be taken over to grow the business.[8]
Wool ski hats with their tops tied off with fishing line were popular, and John noticed them being sold for $20, which he considered overpriced.[9] He went home and sewed around 90 hats with his next-door neighbor.[10] They sold their homemade hats for $10 each in front of the New York Coliseum, and made $800 in a single day.[6] After the hats, they began selling screen-printed T-shirts. To break into the market, they sold on consignment and at large events around the Northeast.[11] To make ends meet, John held a full-time job at Red Lobster, working on the FUBU business in between shifts.[12]
Sensing potential, Daymond and his mother mortgaged their house for $100,000 to generate start-up capital.[6] In addition to Brown, he recruited longtime friends J. Alexander Martin and Keith Perrin into the business, and began sewing the FUBU logo onto hockey jerseys, sweatshirts, and T-shirts.[6] They loaned about 10 of the hockey jerseys out to rappers for their music videos for 2 years. They were perceived as a large clothing brand, despite being a relatively small company and stores started requesting their brand.[11] In 1993, he convinced LL Cool J, an old neighborhood friend, to wear a FUBU T-shirt for a promotional campaign.[13] Later, while filming a 30-second advertising spot for The Gap, LL Cool J wore a FUBU hat in the commercial and incorporated the line "for us, by us" in his rapping.[12][14]
In 1992, Daymond received $300,000 in orders and also an offer for participating in Macy's (M) at a Las Vegas fashion trade show.[15] They had to take out a second mortgage of his mother's house in order to fulfill the orders.[11][16]
Today, the brand is reportedly worth $6 billion.[15]
FUBU is featured at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[17]
Shark Tank[edit]
In 2009, John joined the cast of Shark Tank,[18] a show in which John and four other business executives listen to business pitches from everyday people, and decide whether or not to invest money in their projects.[19][20]
John has invested $7,667,000 dollars in Shark Tank projects as of August 6, 2015.[21]
In 2016, Shark Tank won an Emmy Award,[22] and won Outstanding Reality Program from 2012-2014.[23]
His favorite investments on record were Al "Bubba" Baker's boneless ribs and Bombas socks.[24]
Consulting and speaking[edit]
John has become a public speaker.[25][26] He works with brands and celebrities to create additional revenue streams and brand extensions; some of his clients include Pitbull and the Miss Universe Organization.[27] John is also a brand ambassador for the e-commerce company Shopify.[28] He regularly features his favorite fashion and clothing items on his Daymond John profile page.
As a motivational and business speaker, John speaks about marketing, negotiations, and entrepreneurship. Some of his recent speaking engagements include California First Lady Maria Shriver’s Women’s Conference, AT&T’s History Makers Tour, Babson College School of Entrepreneurship and the Creative LIAisons program at the annual London International Awards.[29][30][31][32][33] In 2016, he was one of the top 10 most booked speakers.
Awards and reception[edit]
John has received numerous awards, including Brandweek Marketer of the Year, the NAACP Entrepreneurs of the Year Award (which he won twice), the Advertising Age Marketing 1000 Award for Outstanding Ad Campaign, the Essence Award, Crain’s New York Business Forty Under Forty Award, Ernst & Young’s New York Entrepreneur of the Year Award, the Brandeis University International Business School’s Asper Award for Excellence in Global Entrepreneurship, Details 50 Most Influential Men, and the Congressional Achievement Award for Entrepreneurship (which he won twice).[12][18][34][35][36]
FUBU has received attention from the sports and entertainment industry, and has been worn or endorsed by LL Cool J, Janet Jackson, Will Smith, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes, Magic Johnson, Lennox Lewis, and Whitney Houston.[9][10]

Early life[edit]
John grew up in the Queens neighborhood of Hollis.[4] An only child, John was raised by his mother and grandfather. Early jobs included handing out flyers and waiting tables at Red Lobster.[5] He attended Bayside High School.[6] In high school, he participated in a program that allowed him to work a full-time job and attend school on an alternating weekly basis, which he credits with instilling an entrepreneurial spirit.[7] After graduating high school, he started a commuter van service.[4]
Career[edit]
FUBU[edit]
When Daymond John first had the idea for a clothing company for young men, his mother taught him how to sew and supported him by allowing her house to be taken over to grow the business.[8]
Wool ski hats with their tops tied off with fishing line were popular, and John noticed them being sold for $20, which he considered overpriced.[9] He went home and sewed around 90 hats with his next-door neighbor.[10] They sold their homemade hats for $10 each in front of the New York Coliseum, and made $800 in a single day.[6] After the hats, they began selling screen-printed T-shirts. To break into the market, they sold on consignment and at large events around the Northeast.[11] To make ends meet, John held a full-time job at Red Lobster, working on the FUBU business in between shifts.[12]
Sensing potential, Daymond and his mother mortgaged their house for $100,000 to generate start-up capital.[6] In addition to Brown, he recruited longtime friends J. Alexander Martin and Keith Perrin into the business, and began sewing the FUBU logo onto hockey jerseys, sweatshirts, and T-shirts.[6] They loaned about 10 of the hockey jerseys out to rappers for their music videos for 2 years. They were perceived as a large clothing brand, despite being a relatively small company and stores started requesting their brand.[11] In 1993, he convinced LL Cool J, an old neighborhood friend, to wear a FUBU T-shirt for a promotional campaign.[13] Later, while filming a 30-second advertising spot for The Gap, LL Cool J wore a FUBU hat in the commercial and incorporated the line "for us, by us" in his rapping.[12][14]
In 1992, Daymond received $300,000 in orders and also an offer for participating in Macy's (M) at a Las Vegas fashion trade show.[15] They had to take out a second mortgage of his mother's house in order to fulfill the orders.[11][16]
Today, the brand is reportedly worth $6 billion.[15]
FUBU is featured at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[17]
Shark Tank[edit]
In 2009, John joined the cast of Shark Tank,[18] a show in which John and four other business executives listen to business pitches from everyday people, and decide whether or not to invest money in their projects.[19][20]
John has invested $7,667,000 dollars in Shark Tank projects as of August 6, 2015.[21]
In 2016, Shark Tank won an Emmy Award,[22] and won Outstanding Reality Program from 2012-2014.[23]
His favorite investments on record were Al "Bubba" Baker's boneless ribs and Bombas socks.[24]
Consulting and speaking[edit]
John has become a public speaker.[25][26] He works with brands and celebrities to create additional revenue streams and brand extensions; some of his clients include Pitbull and the Miss Universe Organization.[27] John is also a brand ambassador for the e-commerce company Shopify.[28] He regularly features his favorite fashion and clothing items on his Daymond John profile page.
As a motivational and business speaker, John speaks about marketing, negotiations, and entrepreneurship. Some of his recent speaking engagements include California First Lady Maria Shriver’s Women’s Conference, AT&T’s History Makers Tour, Babson College School of Entrepreneurship and the Creative LIAisons program at the annual London International Awards.[29][30][31][32][33] In 2016, he was one of the top 10 most booked speakers.
Awards and reception[edit]
John has received numerous awards, including Brandweek Marketer of the Year, the NAACP Entrepreneurs of the Year Award (which he won twice), the Advertising Age Marketing 1000 Award for Outstanding Ad Campaign, the Essence Award, Crain’s New York Business Forty Under Forty Award, Ernst & Young’s New York Entrepreneur of the Year Award, the Brandeis University International Business School’s Asper Award for Excellence in Global Entrepreneurship, Details 50 Most Influential Men, and the Congressional Achievement Award for Entrepreneurship (which he won twice).[12][18][34][35][36]
FUBU has received attention from the sports and entertainment industry, and has been worn or endorsed by LL Cool J, Janet Jackson, Will Smith, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes, Magic Johnson, Lennox Lewis, and Whitney Houston.[9][10]
Books[edit]
John has written three books, Display of Power, The Brand Within, and The Power of Broke. Display of Power is an autobiography that details John's life and early business career. The Power of Broke is a motivational business book that features stories from 15 entrepreneurs, including Steve Aoki, Rob Dyrdek, Kevin Plank, and Loren Ridinger.[37][38] Released in January 2016, it appeared on the WSJ[39] and NYTimes[40] bestseller lists, and received an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Instructional Literary Work.[41]
Personal life[edit]
John is dyslexic.[42] Two of his favorite books are Think and Grow Rich and Rich Dad Poor Dad.[12] His father is from Trinidad and Tobago.

Early life[edit]
John grew up in the Queens neighborhood of Hollis.[4] An only child, John was raised by his mother and grandfather. Early jobs included handing out flyers and waiting tables at Red Lobster.[5] He attended Bayside High School.[6] In high school, he participated in a program that allowed him to work a full-time job and attend school on an alternating weekly basis, which he credits with instilling an entrepreneurial spirit.[7] After graduating high school, he started a commuter van service.[4]
Career[edit]
FUBU[edit]
When Daymond John first had the idea for a clothing company for young men, his mother taught him how to sew and supported him by allowing her house to be taken over to grow the business.[8]
Wool ski hats with their tops tied off with fishing line were popular, and John noticed them being sold for $20, which he considered overpriced.[9] He went home and sewed around 90 hats with his next-door neighbor.[10] They sold their homemade hats for $10 each in front of the New York Coliseum, and made $800 in a single day.[6] After the hats, they began selling screen-printed T-shirts. To break into the market, they sold on consignment and at large events around the Northeast.[11] To make ends meet, John held a full-time job at Red Lobster, working on the FUBU business in between shifts.[12]
Sensing potential, Daymond and his mother mortgaged their house for $100,000 to generate start-up capital.[6] In addition to Brown, he recruited longtime friends J. Alexander Martin and Keith Perrin into the business, and began sewing the FUBU logo onto hockey jerseys, sweatshirts, and T-shirts.[6] They loaned about 10 of the hockey jerseys out to rappers for their music videos for 2 years. They were perceived as a large clothing brand, despite being a relatively small company and stores started requesting their brand.[11] In 1993, he convinced LL Cool J, an old neighborhood friend, to wear a FUBU T-shirt for a promotional campaign.[13] Later, while filming a 30-second advertising spot for The Gap, LL Cool J wore a FUBU hat in the commercial and incorporated the line "for us, by us" in his rapping.[12][14]
In 1992, Daymond received $300,000 in orders and also an offer for participating in Macy's (M) at a Las Vegas fashion trade show.[15] They had to take out a second mortgage of his mother's house in order to fulfill the orders.[11][16]
Today, the brand is reportedly worth $6 billion.[15]
FUBU is featured at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[17]
Shark Tank[edit]
In 2009, John joined the cast of Shark Tank,[18] a show in which John and four other business executives listen to business pitches from everyday people, and decide whether or not to invest money in their projects.[19][20]
John has invested $7,667,000 dollars in Shark Tank projects as of August 6, 2015.[21]
In 2016, Shark Tank won an Emmy Award,[22] and won Outstanding Reality Program from 2012-2014.[23]
His favorite investments on record were Al "Bubba" Baker's boneless ribs and Bombas socks.[24]
Consulting and speaking[edit]
John has become a public speaker.[25][26] He works with brands and celebrities to create additional revenue streams and brand extensions; some of his clients include Pitbull and the Miss Universe Organization.[27] John is also a brand ambassador for the e-commerce company Shopify.[28] He regularly features his favorite fashion and clothing items on his Daymond John profile page.
As a motivational and business speaker, John speaks about marketing, negotiations, and entrepreneurship. Some of his recent speaking engagements include California First Lady Maria Shriver’s Women’s Conference, AT&T’s History Makers Tour, Babson College School of Entrepreneurship and the Creative LIAisons program at the annual London International Awards.[29][30][31][32][33] In 2016, he was one of the top 10 most booked speakers.
Awards and reception[edit]
John has received numerous awards, including Brandweek Marketer of the Year, the NAACP Entrepreneurs of the Year Award (which he won twice), the Advertising Age Marketing 1000 Award for Outstanding Ad Campaign, the Essence Award, Crain’s New York Business Forty Under Forty Award, Ernst & Young’s New York Entrepreneur of the Year Award, the Brandeis University International Business School’s Asper Award for Excellence in Global Entrepreneurship, Details 50 Most Influential Men, and the Congressional Achievement Award for Entrepreneurship (which he won twice).[12][18][34][35][36]
FUBU has received attention from the sports and entertainment industry, and has been worn or endorsed by LL Cool J, Janet Jackson, Will Smith, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes, Magic Johnson, Lennox Lewis, and Whitney Houston.[9][10]
Books[edit]
John has written three books, Display of Power, The Brand Within, and The Power of Broke. Display of Power is an autobiography that details John's life and early business career. The Power of Broke is a motivational business book that features stories from 15 entrepreneurs, including Steve Aoki, Rob Dyrdek, Kevin Plank, and Loren Ridinger.[37][38] Released in January 2016, it appeared on the WSJ[39] and NYTimes[40] bestseller lists, and received an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Instructional Literary Work.[41]
Personal life[edit]
John is dyslexic.[42] Two of his favorite books are Think and Grow Rich and Rich Dad Poor Dad.[12] His father is from Trinidad and Tobago.

Early life[edit]
John grew up in the Queens neighborhood of Hollis.[4] An only child, John was raised by his mother and grandfather. Early jobs included handing out flyers and waiting tables at Red Lobster.[5] He attended Bayside High School.[6] In high school, he participated in a program that allowed him to work a full-time job and attend school on an alternating weekly basis, which he credits with instilling an entrepreneurial spirit.[7] After graduating high school, he started a commuter van service.[4]
Career[edit]
FUBU[edit]
When Daymond John first had the idea for a clothing company for young men, his mother taught him how to sew and supported him by allowing her house to be taken over to grow the business.[8]
Wool ski hats with their tops tied off with fishing line were popular, and John noticed them being sold for $20, which he considered overpriced.[9] He went home and sewed around 90 hats with his next-door neighbor.[10] They sold their homemade hats for $10 each in front of the New York Coliseum, and made $800 in a single day.[6] After the hats, they began selling screen-printed T-shirts. To break into the market, they sold on consignment and at large events around the Northeast.[11] To make ends meet, John held a full-time job at Red Lobster, working on the FUBU business in between shifts.[12]
Sensing potential, Daymond and his mother mortgaged their house for $100,000 to generate start-up capital.[6] In addition to Brown, he recruited longtime friends J. Alexander Martin and Keith Perrin into the business, and began sewing the FUBU logo onto hockey jerseys, sweatshirts, and T-shirts.[6] They loaned about 10 of the hockey jerseys out to rappers for their music videos for 2 years. They were perceived as a large clothing brand, despite being a relatively small company and stores started requesting their brand.[11] In 1993, he convinced LL Cool J, an old neighborhood friend, to wear a FUBU T-shirt for a promotional campaign.[13] Later, while filming a 30-second advertising spot for The Gap, LL Cool J wore a FUBU hat in the commercial and incorporated the line "for us, by us" in his rapping.[12][14]
In 1992, Daymond received $300,000 in orders and also an offer for participating in Macy's (M) at a Las Vegas fashion trade show.[15] They had to take out a second mortgage of his mother's house in order to fulfill the orders.[11][16]
Today, the brand is reportedly worth $6 billion.[15]
FUBU is featured at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[17]
Shark Tank[edit]
In 2009, John joined the cast of Shark Tank,[18] a show in which John and four other business executives listen to business pitches from everyday people, and decide whether or not to invest money in their projects.[19][20]
John has invested $7,667,000 dollars in Shark Tank projects as of August 6, 2015.[21]
In 2016, Shark Tank won an Emmy Award,[22] and won Outstanding Reality Program from 2012-2014.[23]
His favorite investments on record were Al "Bubba" Baker's boneless ribs and Bombas socks.[24]
Consulting and speaking[edit]
John has become a public speaker.[25][26] He works with brands and celebrities to create additional revenue streams and brand extensions; some of his clients include Pitbull and the Miss Universe Organization.[27] John is also a brand ambassador for the e-commerce company Shopify.[28] He regularly features his favorite fashion and clothing items on his Daymond John profile page.
As a motivational and business speaker, John speaks about marketing, negotiations, and entrepreneurship. Some of his recent speaking engagements include California First Lady Maria Shriver’s Women’s Conference, AT&T’s History Makers Tour, Babson College School of Entrepreneurship and the Creative LIAisons program at the annual London International Awards.[29][30][31][32][33] In 2016, he was one of the top 10 most booked speakers.
Awards and reception[edit]
John has received numerous awards, including Brandweek Marketer of the Year, the NAACP Entrepreneurs of the Year Award (which he won twice), the Advertising Age Marketing 1000 Award for Outstanding Ad Campaign, the Essence Award, Crain’s New York Business Forty Under Forty Award, Ernst & Young’s New York Entrepreneur of the Year Award, the Brandeis University International Business School’s Asper Award for Excellence in Global Entrepreneurship, Details 50 Most Influential Men, and the Congressional Achievement Award for Entrepreneurship (which he won twice).[12][18][34][35][36]
FUBU has received attention from the sports and entertainment industry, and has been worn or endorsed by LL Cool J, Janet Jackson, Will Smith, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes, Magic Johnson, Lennox Lewis, and Whitney Houston.[9][10]
Books[edit]
John has written three books, Display of Power, The Brand Within, and The Power of Broke. Display of Power is an autobiography that details John's life and early business career. The Power of Broke is a motivational business book that features stories from 15 entrepreneurs, including Steve Aoki, Rob Dyrdek, Kevin Plank, and Loren Ridinger.[37][38] Released in January 2016, it appeared on the WSJ[39] and NYTimes[40] bestseller lists, and received an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Instructional Literary Work.[41]
Personal life[edit]
John is dyslexic.[42] Two of his favorite books are Think and Grow Rich and Rich Dad Poor Dad.[12] His father is from Trinidad and Tobago.

Who was the John the Baptist, and why is he so important?
A powerful figure in all four gospels, St. John the Baptist nevertheless remains shrouded in mystery. What do we know about his life on the margins of first-century Palestine? And how can the gospels and Dead Sea Scrolls help us to understand the ministry and message of this New Testament prophet?
You will discover the fascinating answers to these questions in John the Baptist. Under the guidance of renowned New Testament scholar Fr. Raymond F. Collins, you will explore the diverse portrayals of St. John in history, the Bible, and even other religions. 
First, you will gain insight into his historical context by looking at contemporaneous texts: the Dead Sea Scrolls and the writings of Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian. Then, you will turn to the earliest gospel, Mark, where you’ll see John as an apocalyptic preacher who baptizes Jesus. You’ll learn how the Gospel of Matthew expounds upon John’s message, and how Luke portrays John as a social prophet and preacher crying out for justice. After looking at the Fourth Evangelist’s unique portrait of John the Baptist, you’ll move beyond the New Testament, looking at portrayals in apocryphal texts, the Qur’an, and the liturgical tradition.
As you listen to these lectures, you will add your own image of John the Baptist to this impressive list of witnesses. Encounter this powerful prophet today.

Praise for Raymond Collins
“Fr. Ray Collins is one of the finest New Testament scholars in the English-speaking world. . . . Fr. Collins uses an easy and understandable style."– Fr. John Ludwig
“Father Collins’ superb scholarship shines through his accessible, lively and engaging lectures. As a parish director of adult education, I find them extremely helpful. They bring to life the New Testament writings in the context of the early Christian communities, allowing the viewer to better appreciate the relevance of these writings for today.”– Fátima Lee, Ph.D., Lay Pastoral Associate
“Not only a world class New Testament scholar and a prolific author of over fifteen books and three hundred articles, Fr. Raymond F. Collins is also a dynamic educator who makes complex ideas interesting and accessible to the non-expert. For good reason, he has been invited to conduct seminars, workshops and retreats around the world. If you are interested in solid, sound and erudite Biblical interpretation, look no further.”– Edward Sirois, Chair, Religious Studies, La Salle AcademyLearn More About This ProfessorReviews
