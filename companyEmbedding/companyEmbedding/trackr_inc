TrackR, Inc. Key Developments

Trackr, Inc. Works with TrackR Platform Win with Brisant
Apr 12 17
TrackR, Inc. announced another Works with TrackR platform win with Brisant, the high-security door lock specialist. The Works with TrackR platform enables developers and manufacturers to find any item via Bluetooth-low-energy (which consumes 50 times less power than Bluetooth Classic) or TrackR's Crowd Locate network. The latest product to use Works with TrackR is Brisant's innovative Ultion Keyring. Ultion Keyring's built-in TrackR technology means homeowners can connect their smartphone to their keys via Bluetooth. Using the slick and the user-friendly TrackR app, they can ring their lost keys. If the homeowners are in the house but still can't find them, they just need to press a button on the app and their keys ring due to a 95 decibels' buzzer. To make finding them at night even easier, Brisant has created a luminous Ultion Keyring that glows brightly in the dark. A real lifesaver, considering keys are the most commonly misplaced items among adults.


Ruckus Wireless Announces Joint Solution with TrackR to Enhance Asset Tracking Capabilities
Jan 5 17
Ruckus Wireless, Inc. announced a joint solution with TrackR combined with Ruckus ZoneFlex™ access points (APs) to enhance the indoor and outdoor location services of TrackR's Crowd GPS network. Leveraging existing wireless infrastructure, the new integration provides customers and end users with enhanced asset movement detection in real time and provides more robust security features for enterprise, education, hospitality and large public venues. This new integration showcases how a Ruckus AP can now operate as an Internet of Things (IoT) gateway by supporting additional radio connectivity protocols like BLE for data acquisition from tags and sensors. Ruckus ZoneFlex APs serve as two-way distributed management and asset and security monitoring for TrackR. Ruckus also provides TrackR with the ability to acquire, contextualize and act on the sensor data being collected. As a result, TrackR can monitor devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones as well as higher value in-building infrastructure assets like TVs, projectors and other equipment. The installation of this solution enhances security and asset protection by triggering an alarm when devices cross defined geo-fences. This enables an in-building or campus-wide asset tracking solution that leverages the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, reducing cost and complexity.


TrackR Works with TrackR Partnership with Ekster to Create Trackable Smart Wallets
Jun 7 16
TrackR announced a partnership with Ekster to create the smallest, smartest trackable and secure RFID-blocking wallets. The new Ekster smart wallets integrate TrackR technology into the ultra-slim, leather design for effortless tracking. The Ekster wallet pairs with the TrackR app to allow for two-way ringing, custom separation alerts and the Crowd GPS network to recover wallets lost or misplaced outside of Bluetooth range. These wallets also offer the fastest card-access mechanism on the market and RFID blocking technology to prevent wireless theft.

VARIATIONS THAT MIGHT APPLY TO THIS LIMITED WARRANTY

Technical Specifications for TrackR






Technical
Specifications




How does TrackR work?


Basics


TrackR devices use Bluetooth to connect to the TrackR app running on your phone. The app can monitor the distance between the phone and device by analyzing the power level of the received signal. This link can be used to ring the TrackR device or have the TrackR device ring the phone.


Bluetooth Low Energy


The device uses a new kind of radio called Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE is not the same as Bluetooth Classic and consumes 50 times less power. TrackR was one of the first companies to use BLE in 2011. Thanks to BLE technology, TrackR devices have up to 1 year battery life while maintaining their small size.

Supported Devices
TrackR requires a tablet or phone to be running the TrackR app in the background. Bluetooth must be left on in the background (don't worry, our engineers have minimized the battery drain on your phone by leaving Bluetooth on).
Devices with iOS 8 & up
Android 4.4 & Later with Bluetooth Low Energy




Crowd Locate
Crowd Locate is an alternative to traditional GPS and revolutionizes the possibilities of what can be tracked. Unlike traditional GPS, Crowd Locate uses the power of the existing cell phones all around us to help locate lost items. The technology works by having the TrackR device broadcast a unique ID over Bluetooth Low Energy when lost. Other users' phones can detect this wireless signal in the background (without the user being aware). When the signal is detected, the phone records the current GPS location, sends a message to the TrackR server, and the TrackR server will then update the item's last known location in its database. It's a way that TrackR is enabling you to automatically keep track of the location of all your items effortlessly.







Track it down. From anywhere.
If your item goes missing, the TrackR app records its last known location on a map. When another TrackR app user comes within Bluetooth range of your lost item, its location will be automatically updated in your app.

							Review:  I am writing to complain about a company possibly involved in an online scam – TrackRBravo.
I first found out about the company and it’s product in a magazine. The magazine article gave the website for ordering the product, which is supposedly a small (quarter-size) device used for tracking lost objects. You attach the product to personal items you want tracked and then use your iPhone to find your lost item.

My bank account was immediately charged for the purchase. However, it has been over a month and the item has yet to be mailed to me or received.

I got online and discovered that the company gives no contact information. There is no address, no customer service phone number, and no viable email address. I went online and checked reviews of the product and discovered that others have had the same complaint - waiting MONTHS and have yet to receive the product paid for. According to the reviews, the company has a Facebook account. However, it regularly removes negative posts and still does not address complaints.

A possible explanation for the delinquency in mailing product could be that the product has not gone through proper Q&A and therefore TrackRBravo is behind in processing orders. The company is most likely a start-up of some sort and they lack insight in the necessity of having adequate customer service.

This does not excuse the manner in which orders are handled - which makes this a possible scam. Most companies do not charge for products ordered online until it is in the mail and on the way to the customer. The fact that TrackRBravo accepts payment for a product which possibly does not currently exist, fully knowing it will not be mailed to the customer, borders on a scam of some sort,

I have attached a copy of my bank statement showing that I was charged for the product.

At this point, I would like to receive reimbursement for product never received. At the very least, I would settle for receiving the product itself (in a timely manner) along with a phone number for handling customer complains (should the product not work or meet expectations).Desired Settlement:  I would like to receive reimbursement for product never received.

                    Business 
                        Response:
                    I apologize about the drop in communications. When you checked out there is a pop up indicating that the shipment times are 6 to 8 weeks  out due to the backlog we are in.I have refunded you for your order.RegardsS***



                    Consumer 
                        Response:


I have reviewed the response made by the business in reference to complaint ID 10742925, and find that this resolution is satisfactory to me.

 I am writing to inform you that the company, TrackRBravo, reimbursed my bank account for the money I spent for a product I never received. My complaint has been satisfactorily resolved.Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Regards, 
R*** *******

							Review:  TrackR Order ID= 442b8d7b-1040-4489-93da-403e6e125305 for $43.18 was placed on 08/18/15 yet, never received. TrackR Online email from Riley W. (TrackR) Nov 7, 13:18 states:Hi B*******Thank you for reaching out to TrackR support. I'm sorry to hear that you have yet to receive your order. However, according to USPS, it was sent for shipping on October 29. Because it was only a single TrackR, we did not receive a tracking number from USPS. It should be arriving any day. Thank you again for your patience.Best regards,RileyTrackR supportShipping my order without a tracking number is ridiculous. They never sent the order and I never received the order. Last year the company: TrackR Bravo received $1,692,130 USD in funding from www.indiegogo.com (funding their dream and our nightmares) and this is what they give their supporters in return, "Nothing" except deceit. I need my payment of $43.18 refunded to me.Desired Settlement:  Refund of order total = $43.18 (and criminal charges for fraud).

							I bought 3 trackr bravo devices during their indiegogo campaign. I took them 2 months to ship (as expected from an initial product launch). I was also informed of this delay before purchasing. This is a new technology and as such has some glitches. That being said my overall experience has been positive. It has saved me on numerous occasions trying to locate my phone or keys as I rush out the door for work. I even lost my keys at a bar in San Diego and was able to locate them the day after because of the GPS tag.

							Review:  Phone Halo did not ship my product for over two weeks after I paid. I complained to Amazon Payments and was contacted by Phone Halo.I told them that I would be leaving the country soon and not receive the product in time.They proceeded to ship the product even though I had no way of receiving it.Very unprofessional service.Desired Settlement:  $20

							Review:  Around 12/17/15 I had ordered 5 devices from Trackr. They were buy some get some free.  Before I even received them, I had changed my mind because they were not going to achieve the results that I had intended them for due to the range.  I wrote an email to them explaining that I would be sending them back as soon as I received them.  An associate responded and said that as soon as they receive them, my refund would be issued.  A few days went by, the order came in, i opened the envelope to see if there was a return slip, there was not.  I printed the return instructions, went to the post office and mailed them back that following day.  I checked on it on the 29th of December, and was told they still did not receive it.  I gave it some time and emailed them again.  The following day, 1/13/16, I finally received a partial refund.  After requesting the remainder of my refund a couple of times, I also requested an explanation as to why I have not received it yet.  I finally heard from them after I emailed them my Paypal receipt stating I had only received $54.00 of the $97.19 that I had paid.  They are telling me now that I only returned 3 of the devices, not 5 so they are only going to refund me the $54.  I told them that was absolutely incorrect.  I had no use for the devices, and I returned all of them!  I asked them to check again-they did and are standing by their decision not to refund me the rest of my money.  This is very poor business, in my opinion.  I also called the # and it did not identify as a business, so I did not leave a message.Desired Settlement:  I just want my money refunded. I feel like they are accusing me of stealing, and that is just not right.  Why would I tell them I was sending back the product even before I received it, if I was going to use it?

							Review:  I ordered 3 TrackR on December 16. The website says ship in 72 hours. I have made many requests online as you can not get in touch with them on the phone. After inquiries I was told it arrived on January 5 which it did NOT. Then I was told it arrived on January 7 which it did NOT. Now I am told that my name was used for the address and will have to wait for the product to return to them so they can send it back to me. It will soon be a month since the order was placed with no product. They do not answer phone so you at Revdex.com is my best hope.  ThanksDesired Settlement:  I would like to have the product. If that does not work then I plan to Contact Visa to try to get my money back. If that does not work then I plan to contact the companies that TrackR says they are partnering with. If that does not work then I am Out the money.

							Review:  On January 2nd, 2015 I purchased an eight pack Trackr Bravo for USD 135. Trackr Bravo is a highly advertised device that is designed to help track lost items using GPS technology. It is produced by a company called TrackR, located in Santa Barbara, California.The current competitor is called "tile", but TrackR Bravo advertising looked far better. That was the reason for me to go and purchase Trackr Bravo instead of Tile.I made the payment through Amazon Payments, and I received notification of successfull payment with transaction id 19AP2D********************R4FD58UEZ. The recipient of the payment was Phone Halo LLC. I used Mastercard ending 8612.I started receiving notifications of my order status. I was first told that my order would arrive on February but it did not happen. So I opened a case with the customer support team (#11**60)on May 21st and I received a generic response in May 22nd explaining the schedule of future orders without specifying the status of my order. I replied then that I wanted my money back.On June 21st I sent another email asking for refund, I was asked to put a claim, which I did on June 22nd, and a new case was opened (#125607). I told my story and I was offered to be included in a "VIP ist" to "receive priority". In the repply I saw the case was marked as SOLVED so I answered on June 23rd that my case was still open and that I did not want to wait anymore, so I asked for my money back for the third time. I got a late repply on July 9th asking if I still needed assistance. I then came back to the original case (#113960) which is still open.I come to you because I have not been successful in getting my refund, so I expect you can help me as I don't need anything else that have my money back because the treatment I have received form TrackR is simply irrespectful and not fair with me as a costumer.Best regards,J*** ****** ******* *******Desired Settlement:  To get a credit on the credit card that I used for the transaction.

							Review:  I ordered $97.19 worth of TrackR product on Dec 7th 2015, and have yet to receive my goods. When you call the company, there is a voicemail saying that due to increased demand they cannot answer the phone and it instructs you to email their support email address and someone will respond within 24 hours. I emailed on Dec 18th with no response and again on Dec 28th. The fact that this company has no way to get a hold of anyone to address issues is unacceptable. At this point, I need to be issued a full refund to my PayPal account @ **********@gmail.com.Desired Settlement:  $97.19 PayPal refund to: **********@gmail.com

							Separation alerts do not work. They go off when the trackr is right next to the phone! Hence it beeps all the time even when the two are close.
Sometimes when you leave your item, the alert does not sound too. The company claims the app works in the background but I got a good 500m away and no alert occurred. As soon as I opened the iOS app, the alert went off. Kinda pointless if the separation alerts only actually work when the app is open (unlike what is claimed).

							Review:  Hello, I placed an order with this company on 4/18/15 and was charged $88.56 on my VISA. I was told that I was pre-ordering the product, but when I placed the order, the website indicated that the product would ship in early May.  When I did not receive the product in early May, I contacted the seller through Amazon Payments and asked for a refund since I was charged and never received the product.  About 8-10 days later I received an email from the company (to which you can't reply) saying thanks for my patience, they were working out the kinks and doing beta testing, and had started shipping first to those that placed early orders.  I tried calling and emailing the company on numerous occasions and cannot reach them or anyone to get a refund.  I have now sent in another request through both Amazon and the company.  They have taken my money and not shipped what I paid for.  They need to refund my money - I feel like this is a scam.  I do not want to keep receiving excuses about Beta testing and emails telling me they are shipping.  I want a refund in full.Desired Settlement:  Full refund to my VISA of $88.54 that I was charged on 4/18 for product I never received.

							Review:  Hello, In October I redeemed an offer for a free Trackr Sticker device, but in order to receive the item in a timely manner I purchased an additional Trackr device.  I have never received either, and have been in contact with Phone Halo costumer service no less than 3 different times trying to receive the product I ordered.  I even started a claim on Amazon.  Each time the company promises to send the product out in a timely manner, never have i received so much as a legitimate tracking number.  I did receive one tracking number, but it had been issued a month before i received it, and never changed from "shipping information received" indicating that the package was never shipped.Desired Settlement:  I would prefer to actually have my product, but it seems the company is in capable of sending out products, which concerns me as I preordered 10 Trackr Bravo devices also, which I understand are not to ship out till next month.  If the company can get their act together and actually ship me the items, I would still be ok with that, but If they cant have them to me by the 9th of March a refund is requested.

                    It was nice speaking with you today, and I am glad we could be of help. The TrackR bravo devices will be shipped out today, and the USPS tracking number for the order is  94******************71. Thank you and have a great day!

							Review:  I ordered 5 TrackR Bravos on 12/7/15. On the 8th I received a notice that the order had been dropped off at a post office in San Bernadino. Tracking through the USPS has been unsuccessful; they show nothing other than apparently it was received at the San Bernadino Post Office.  I have now filed my problem twice on the TrackR website. The charge is posted on my credit card.Desired Settlement:  At this point, if the Bravo's can be delivered within two weeks I will take delivery. If that is not possible - I would like the charge refunded to my credit card.

							Review:  I ordered their product and it never arrived.  I got a USPS tracking number which only lists as pre-shipment.  The product clearly never shipped.  I have called the number on their website and it states they are too busy to accept any phone calls but they will return your email within 24hrs.  Of course no return email.  

I paid for the product.  I have not received the product and no one will answer the phone or an email.  Looks like they stole my $100.Desired Settlement:  I would like my money back or the product to be shipped immediately.

							Review:  The product never arrived. I tracked the package and it came to my city but was re-routed back to the seller - I'm not sure how they were able to do that. I became suspicious at that point. I have since read negative reviews of the product and have decided I don't want their product - I believe this is a scam. I contacted them for a refund but they have not responded.Desired Settlement:  I am requesting a full refund of $97.19.

							Review:  On May 25th I received an e-mail stating my 10 TrackR bravo devices had been shipped along with a USPS tracking number.  On June 1st I sent an e-mail because the USPS website still showed the package in pre-order status. I received an response on June 3rd from L*** in the customer service department stating "I did personally confirm your order has indeed been shipped. You should be receiving your package any day now, if you haven't already."By June 8th I still had not received my order and I sent a follow-up email. No response. I sent another e-mail on June 12th. L*** again responded, this time stating "It appears there were a very small number of orders that were lost in transit with USPS. I am having your order for 10 Bravos resent right away. Once they have shipped you will receive an email with additional shipping information."It is now June 22 and the items still have not been reshipped. I addition, they have not responded to at least two additional requests for a status update and the chat function on their customer service website stats that there is never "an agent available".Desired Settlement:  I would like delivery of the items purchased through the Indegogo campaign.
