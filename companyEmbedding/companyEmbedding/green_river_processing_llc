	Midstream assets operator, QEP Midstream Partners, LP  announced that it has completed the acquisition of 40% stake in Green River Processing LLC from QEP Field Services Company, a subsidiary of QEP Resources Inc. (QEP  -  Free Report)	. The transaction involved a cash consideration of $230 million and is effective from Jul 1. This marks the first acquisition for the partnership post its Initial Public Offering (IPO) that took place in August last year.
	QEP Midstream Partners stated that this transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to its distributable cash flow. The partnership also added that it has used available cash as well as funds from its $500 million credit facility to finance this acquisition.
	Green River Processing is the owner of the Blacks Fork natural gas processing complex and the Emigrant Trail natural gas processing plant. The assets under sale comprise four natural gas processing plants that connect to six interstate natural gas pipelines and have a direct access to the NGL markets at Mt. Belvieu and Conway. These plants have a total natural gas processing capacity of 890 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day and fractionation capacity of 15,000 barrels of natural gas liquid per day.
	QEP Midstream Partners was spun off from QEP Resources and works toward owing and developing midstream assets. The partnership provides natural gas and crude oil gathering and processing services and has assets located in the Green River Basin, the Uinta Basin and the Williston Basin.
	QEP Midstream Partners currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. market in the next one to three months.
	Meanwhile, one can consider better-ranked players from the oil production and pipeline industry such as Holly Energy Partners L.P (HEP  -  Free Report)	 and Pembina Pipeline Corporation (PBA  -  Free Report)	. Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

QEP RESOURCES ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT
TO SELL MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS IN GREEN RIVER PROCESSING TO QEP
MIDSTREAM PARTNERS FOR $230 MILLION
DENVER,
CO May 7, 2014 -
QEP Resources, Inc. (NYSE: QEP) (“QEP” or the
“Company”) today announced that it has entered into a
Purchase and Sale Agreement with QEP Midstream Partners, LP
(NYSE:QEPM) (the “Partnership”) pursuant to which the
Partnership will acquire 40% of the outstanding membership interest
in Green River Processing, LLC (“Green River
Processing”) a wholly owned subsidiary of QEP, for $230
million in cash. The transaction is expected to close on or about
July 1, 2014, subject to customary closing conditions.
At
closing, Green River Processing will own the Blacks Fork processing
complex and the Emigrant Trail processing plant located in
southwest Wyoming. Green River Processing will own four processing
plants with total processing capacity of up to 890 MMcf per day,
natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) fractionation capacity of
15,000 bbl per day, interconnects to six interstate natural gas
pipelines, and direct pipeline access to the Mt. Belvieu and Conway
NGL markets. In 2013, total inlet volumes for Green River
Processing were approximately 201 million MMBtu, of which 65% were
processed under fee-based processing agreements and 35% were
processed under keep-whole processing agreements.
The
Blacks Fork complex contains three processing plants with up to 505
MMcf per day of cryogenic processing capacity and a 330 MMcf per
day Joule-Thomson processing plant. In addition, the complex has
15,000 bbl per day of fractionation capacity and associated truck
and rail loading facilities, which allow Green River Processing to
sell purity products into what are often premium priced local and
regional NGL markets. The majority of gas processed at the Blacks
Forks complex is produced in the Pinedale Anticline which is
approximately 100 miles north of the complex.
The
Emigrant Trail processing plant, located approximately ten miles
south of the Blacks Fork complex, consists of one cryogenic gas
processing train with inlet capacity of approximately 55 MMcf per
day. The plant receives the majority of its gas from various gas
fields along the Moxa Arch, including Church Buttes, located in the
Green River Basin of western Wyoming. The inlets of the Emigrant
Trail plant and the Blacks Fork Complex are interconnected allowing
raw gas to be processed at either or both facilities.

QEPM to purchase membership interests in Green River Processing 








May 8, 2014


QEP Midstream Partners LP 



































QEP Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: QEPM) (the Partnership) has entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire 40% of the outstanding membership interest in Green River Processing LLC for $230 million in cash from QEP Field Services Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of QEP Resources Inc. (NYSE: QEP).  
This transaction represents the Partnership's first acquisition following its initial public offering in August 2013. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to the Partnership's distributable cash flow per unit. The transaction is expected to close on or about July 1. The Partnership will finance the acquisition with borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
At closing, Green River Processing will own the Blacks Fork processing complex and the Emigrant Trail processing plant located in southwest Wyoming. Green River Processing will own four processing plants with total processing capacity of 890 MMcf per day, natural gas liquids (NGLs) fractionation capacity of 15,000 bbl per day, interconnects to six interstate natural gas pipelines, and direct pipeline access to the Mont Belvieu and Conway NGL markets. In 2013, total inlet volumes for Green River Processing were 201 million MMBtu, of which 65% were processed under fee-based processing agreements and 35% were processed under keep-whole processing agreements.
The Blacks Fork complex contains three processing plants with up to 505 MMcf per day of cryogenic processing capacity and a 330 MMcf per day Joule-Thomson processing plant. In addition, the complex has 15,000 bbl per day of fractionation capacity and associated truck and rail loading facilities, which allow Green River Processing to sell purity products into what are often premium-priced local and regional NGL markets. The majority of gas processed at the Blacks Forks complex is produced in the Pinedale Anticline which is 100 miles north of the complex.
The Emigrant Trail processing plant, located 10 miles south of the Blacks Fork complex, consists of one cryogenic gas processing train with inlet capacity of 55 MMcf per day. The plant receives the majority of its gas from various gas fields along the Moxa Arch, including Church Buttes, located in the Green River Basin of western Wyoming. The inlets of the Emigrant Trail plant and the Blacks Fork Complex are interconnected allowing raw gas to be processed at either or both facilities.  
The terms of the acquisition were approved by the board of directors of the General Partner of the Partnership, based on the approval and recommendation of the Conflicts Committee, which is made up entirely of independent directors. The Conflicts Committee was advised by Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. regarding financial matters and by Andrews Kurth LLP regarding legal matters.

Rock River Resources to build crude oil processing plant in Utah








September 25, 2013


Rock River Resources



































Rock River Resources will build a new crude oil processing plant and rail terminaling facility in Green River, Utah. The Emery project will require a capital investment of over $230 million and will provide a long-term viable crude processing option in the region.
The first phase of the project is planned to break ground in 2013 and will be operational in 2014. It is expected to employ up to 300 workers at peak construction and once all phases are completed roughly 125 operational jobs will be created.
According to the company, the Emery project will use emission control technologies that will enable the facility to meet emission limits that are among the most stringent ever required for a refinery of this design. The company expects, due to minimal emissions, the facility to be classified as a “Minor Source” by the State of Utah.
“Rock River Resources has received strong support from state and local community leaders and we have worked closely with them during the early phases of the project,” said Jeff Beicker, COO of Rock River Resources. “Our goal is to be a partner with the community and ensure that the benefits of the project are felt not only in Green River, but across the state of Utah. We look forward to providing options for producers in the region.”
The first segment of the project will include a terminaling and rail loading facility that will provide services for local producers for crude terminaling. The terminaling facility is projected to be operational in 2014. The second segment of the project will be a 10,000 barrel per day topping plant that will process local crudes and condensates into naptha, fuel oil, diesel and jet fuel. The topping plant should be operational by mid-2015. The final segment of the project will be a processing plant for regional wax crudes that will produce refined paraffin waxes and lube oils. The wax plant should be operational by mid-2016.
