Jagruti Kapadia, UI/UX Designer




































Hi I'm Jagruti Kapadia!




Welcome to my world of design!



























About me

Who am I?






















                                I'm a User Experience Designer at SAP in Palo Alto, California.
                                I have completed my Master's in Computer Science - Human Computer Interaction at Northeastern University based in Boston.
                                I specialize in product design, making user interfaces visually beautiful and delivering delightful user experience. 
                                Alongside this, I also possess expertise in front-end development, with focus on  responsiveness, 
                                friendly code and importantly something that's attractively suited to the topic :). 
                                

                                My background in Art & Design traces to my teenage years when I had been a national level gold medalist 
                                in drawing and painting. I love bringing colors to life through my digital work. Being deeply passionate 
                                about Design, I can create awesome designs for the Web and Mobile.
                                

                                I enjoy understanding how great designs work and showing the same to others through good, intuitive and 
                                user-friendly experiences. My previous experience in UI/UX Design at Barclays and Intralinks has given me 
                                great exposure in crafting a comprehensive look and feel for products, working in the agile environment and 
                                driving requirements from concept to release. Prior to this, I also had the wonderful opportunity to be a part 
                                of L&T Infotech and Birla Urja, where I enjoyed designing Mobile and Web applications, focusing on simplicity, 
                                and user friendly experience. 
                                

                                I love working on web design and development and have driven UI requirements from concept to deployment. Possessing 
                                skills that are a combination of design and development, I can make things beautiful, interactive and enjoyable to use. 
                                

                                Thank you for stopping by :)

                                "Jagruti is a delight to work with.  Her sense of design is excellent, 
                                and as leader of a team of 5 peers she did a great job motivating them 
                                to produce an outstanding project under considerable pressure."
                            
- Jim Miller - Vice President - Product Development, Google -









                                "Jagruti has an amazing eye for aesthetic design. I was impressed with her enthusiasm and passion to think deeper about projects she works on. 
                                She has great intuition for when things look just right or when there's something even minor missing. She's cheerful and fun to work with!"
                            
- Shubha Puthran - Associate Professor, NMIMS University -

                                by going about her love for making things look beautiful! - but within the given constraints."
