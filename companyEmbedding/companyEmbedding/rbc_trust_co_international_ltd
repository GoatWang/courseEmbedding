The Delaware Advantage
A Delaware Trust can provide you with valuable benefits today—and for many years to come.
The state of Delaware has long been known as the corporate capital of the United States. More than half of the Fortune 500 companies are incorporated there. But Delaware is also a major center for personal trust management. And with good reason. Compared to other states, Delaware offers:





Greater Confidentiality
A Delaware Trust offers the least governmental interference and the highest degree of confidentiality of all states.




A Higher Level of Protection from Creditors
Shielding trust assets from creditors is a primary consideration in Delaware.






Greater Investment Flexibility
In Delaware, a grantor can retain or give to the trustee as much or as little control over investments as he or she desires.




No Rule Against Perpetuities
Most states require that all interests must vest no later than 21 years after the end of a life (or lives) in being at the creation of the trust.






Lower Administration Costs
The Delaware Court of Chancery has a solid reputation for its well-reasoned decisions on corporate law.




Greater Tax Savings
Delaware provides certain tax exemptions for trusts set up by nonresidents.





As a result, millions of Americans have set up Delaware Trusts, including many of the nation's wealthiest people. For example, while less than one-half percent of the population lives in Delaware, over 10 percent of those listed in the Forbes 400 have established trusts in Delaware.





Conclusion
Delaware Trusts offer a wide range of benefits. They provide the confidentiality and security you desire as well as the investment flexibility and cost savings you need to help you maximize their potential.
For more information about Delaware Trusts, call your financial advisor or RBC Trust Company (Delaware) Limited at 800-441-7698. We will gladly answer any additional questions you may have and, in conjunction with your financial advisor, help you design a trust that best suits your individual financial needs.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
