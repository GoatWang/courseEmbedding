(SHSP) Mingran Wang Value, Growth, long onlyMingran Wang's Blog SiteSummaryMarketing Automation is the future of smart marketing. This Industry has seen 50% annual growth in the last few years, and is still a fertile ground for much more growth.SharpSpring, which only started 3 years ago, has grown to the #2 position in the agencies market. It has also seen 100% growth in the last year.Market didn't fully appreciate the growth because of the past financial metrics, but I will list several dynamics that are worth considering for different future expectations.Overall, a hardworking owner operator, a powerful business model and a fast growing industry can be a powerful combination for a long runway of growth.Business Background Marketing Automation is a hot industry that has seen very dramatic growth in the last few years. The top players, such as HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) or Marketo, have all had fantastic growth (around 50% top line growth per year). People are adopting this new way of marketing because more and more customer activities are shifted from offline to online, and businesses need a smarter way to do marketing. 

 Source: SharpSpring Investor Presentation December 2016 In this space, SharpSpring (NASDAQ:SHSP) is a relatively small player. However, given that it only launched its first product in 2014 (7 years later than HubSpot), one could argue that its achievements are also amazing. For example, I remember Act-On was a very promising player in the early years, and many times bigger than SharpSpring. However, at this time, Act-On is about the same size as SharpSpring. In the marketing automation space, SharpSpring is now one of the top 5 or 6 players. Its growth was over 100% in year 2016. That growth was mostly due to its unique business model: leveraging the 3rd party resources in marketing agencies.
 In any industry, it is hard for a small player to fight much bigger competitors. This is why SharpSpring's founder and CEO Rick Carlson came up with a very interesting business model: by giving marketing agencies 1/10 of the cost, it will leverage the marketing agencies to do the sales, marketing and customer support for him. This model is powerful because it suits a small company very well. Developing the marketing automation business is no easy task. Big players have significant advantage on marketing and sales. After the initial adoption, customer support is also very resource-intensive, since marketing automation has a big learning curve for most beginners. By leveraging the resources of marketing agencies, SharpSpring will be able to essentially outsource much of the marketing, sales and customer support efforts to the 3rd parties. For example, after training a marketing agency, SharpSpring's customer support will be only facing that agency, instead of the clients of agencies. Therefore, once the agencies have learned their way, they will be providing all the support to their customers and free up the human resources in SharpSpring. By giving more incentive to agencies, SharpSpring also enlisted the agencies' support on marketing and sales. The Powerful Business Model In the business world, a lot of things are not just measured by money. For example, if a company is to grow the operations organically, it would take more than just money, but also "time" to reach a certain scale. Beyond that, there is a question of operating efficiencies when managing a much larger company. And a question of how easily it can be to down scale the operations when needed. This is why I think SharpSpring's business model is very powerful. Essentially it is another form of "franchise" model where each agency would become a distributor, pay a percentage fee based on sales (in this case it is a fixed monthly fee based on the number of clients), and handle the operations themselves. For sure, it isn't a franchising model on the surface, but the underlying economics are very similar. As you can see, all the following benefits for the franchising model can also apply here.
 There are many benefits in this model: 1. Fast scale-up. The franchiser doesn't have to worry about taking the time to build up new shops and hire new employees. When a company tries to grow very fast organically, it is hard to hire the right people very fast and not potentially leave a nightmare later. 2. Efficient management. By adopting this fully decentralized model, each operating unit is small and can be managed very efficiently. The unit is also financially standalone, making each unit owner/manager fully motivated. 3. Lower capital requirement. This model is to enlist many partners and therefore reduce the capital requirement significantly. 4. Low operating leverage. These partners don't just provide the capital, they would share the ongoing risks too. This is why the franchiser usually has high gross margin and lower operating leverage. 5. Easier to scale down. If scale-up for regular businesses is slow and risky, the scale-down process (if something goes wrong) is painful and even more risky. It could even kill the firm on the way down, especially when they have both high operating leverage and high financial leverage. On the contrary, a franchiser has much less risks when it does need to scale down the business. Of course, not everything is perfect with this kind of model. For instance, once you license out to the 3rd parties, you can't directly control the quality of the service. So if not doing it carefully, it could potentially damage the brand. Fortunately, this is not a big concern for SharpSpring, since marketing automation is facing marketing professionals (agencies), instead of consumers. The brand is not as useful here (when comparing with a regular consumer brand), otherwise the SMB customers would not look for help from an agency in the first place. (In general, brand is more powerful when facing consumers since consumers usually have less time to do researches to discover the true value of a product.) What is the Market Missing? This story is not totally new, and the company has achieved pretty amazing growth, but the share price has been down 10% in the last 12 months, even though the market has been up, so you might be wondering what is going on there and what is the market missing?
 I think there are two main reasons why the shares were down: 1. Although the growth has been amazing, the company is still not profitable, and it has been burning a lot of cash on that growth path. 2. Last quarter, the growth number has been down sequentially, from 244 customer additions to 213 additions. Even though the CEO Rick Carlson said he expected modest step-up (in new enrollment) in Q1 2017, the customer additions were roughly flat over the last 4 quarters. If a company didn't see accelerated growth and also burned a lot of cash, it is easy to understand the weakness in the share price. I think those concerns are all reasonable and understandable. In some sense, it is even more assuring, because in this market, it is hard to believe that the market will completely ignore a fast growing company, even when that is a microcap. If the shares are not shooting up after high growth, there has to be a reason. At least the reasons are fairly obvious on the surface. That said, I believe there are still some dynamics the market has missed by focusing on the past financial metrics: 1. Unique positioning. Everything being equal, we would of course want to invest in the market leader, but we should also recognize the unique positioning in SharpSpring. First, despite being 50 times smaller than HubSpot in market cap, it is the #2 player in the agencies space for marketing automation. (It has about 1/3 of agency customers when compared with HubSpot). 

 Source: SharpSpring Investor Presentation December 2016 Second, its small size, much lower pricing and focus on agencies made big players feel very hard to compete with them. Third, this industry is not as easy to enter as I once believed. This is because marketing automation is rather complex and requires many features and components to work together. One evidence is that there weren't any new players posing threats to SharpSpring in the last 2 years. The feature gap is also getting smaller and smaller between HubSpot and SharpSpring.
 

 Source: Marketing Automation Insider All these mean that SharpSpring's business model will likely to stay valid for a long time to come. The problem it is facing right now is more of a resource and growth speed problem, than a competition problem. 2. "S" curve in growth. One interesting phenomena is the "S" curve in growth. This applies to both a new industry and a new firm. For marketing automation, I think it is still in the early stages, especially for SMBs. Most small/medium businesses are still using traditional marketing methods. Even the marketing agencies still have many of them not ready to adopt marketing automation yet. However, this is the future of marketing, simply because it is much more powerful. While the industry could see a fast adoption phase later, a new firm such as SharpSpring also has a critical mass to reach. At some point, the awareness could build on itself. 3. Lower churn rate. One thing special with marketing automation is that its switching cost is not just high, but also gets higher over time. The learning curve is usually high for both agencies and their clients. But more importantly, once it has been used for some time, just the existing data stored in this platform itself would provide a strong reason to stay with that platform. For this reason, the retention rate should get higher over time. For instance, HubSpot's quarterly retention rate was in high 80's in 2014, but got to high 90's in 2015 and 2016. SharpSpring's past monthly churn rate was 3%, but got to 2.3% in the last quarter. Over time, it is reasonable to expect it to get even lower than that. And this implies both higher net growth and more pricing power. 4. The ecosystem and product differentiation.
 I found it interesting that SharpSpring has even more integrations with other platforms than HubSpot does. As shown below, SharpSpring has both SAP and Oracle integrations, but HubSpot doesn't. Recently, it also added integrations with Shutterstock, Enthusem and PieSync. This can build out an ecosystem and can have more product differentiation, further improving its competitive strength for the long term. 

 Source: Marketing Automation Insider 5. Capital free growth and margin expansion. One good thing about SharpSpring's model is that marketing agencies will try to grow their own businesses, and when they grow, it will add to SharpSpring's revenue over time. This is essentially what I call "capital-free growth". Also, since SharpSpring only provides support to agencies, but not to agencies' clients, there is some potential margin expansion when the agencies' client base gets bigger (growing revenue, but not growing operating expenses proportionally). Another important thing to point out is that the new customers additions don't include the additions of agencies' clients. Although those additions have much lower pricing than direct sales, it still provides a lot of values: first, it is capital-free growth. Second, it boosts the awareness and market share. Finally, it will also help agencies to focus on SharpSpring instead of other competitors. 6. The current cash balance is likely to be enough to fund the future growth and get to cash flow break-even. 


 At the end of 2016, the company has $8.65M cash and no debt. But since the company has just paid $5.7M tax in 2016 as shown in the cash flow statement (because of the divestiture of the SMTP business), it is likely to get back much of the tax in the next few years (in fact, there is $1.35M tax receivable in the current asset). For this reason, I expect the company will have a total of $13 million cash to fund the growth. (This $13 million cash is not the current cash balance, but the cash available to be used in the next few years to sustain the cash burn, as shown in the table above.) As the company grows its scale, its operating losses will get smaller and smaller. In my estimation, it's likely to achieve positive EBITDA within 2 - 3 years, even if we assume no churn-rate reduction and no accelerated growth, and the current cash should be enough to fund the growth in that time frame. (The last quarter had about $1.6M cash burn, but since this figure is getting smaller over time, we may expect $13 million is enough for the next 2-3 years.) All in all, although the past growth has been flat, it doesn't mean the future growth will stay at the same rate and not accelerate instead. In the following figure, we can see although the revenue addition has been flat quarter to quarter in 2016, there was a major step-up when comparing between 2016 and 2015. In 2015, the average revenue addition per quarter was $1.3 - $1.4M, but this figure grows to $1.7 - $1.8M per quarter in 2016. 

 


 Source: SharpSpring Investor Presentation December 2016 Risks As any early stage growth companies, there is significant risk involved in this company. The main risk is the uncertainty around the growth rate. It is very hard to predict what the future growth rate will look like. If the company can't grow fast enough, the cash burn may be even more than my conservative estimation, and we may see further dilutions in unfavorable terms. Valuation First, before closing down GraphicMail and selling SMTP, there were 3 businesses entangled together and very hard to see the trend clearly. This has changed a lot since June 2016, since the sale of SMTP happened in June 2016, and migration of GraphicMail to SharpSpring Mail+ happened in the first half 2016 too. Because SharpSpring Mail+ revenue is only about $200K per quarter, the Q4 2016 financial statements should fully reflect the true economics of the SharpSpring Marketing Automation product. Currently, HubSpot is being traded at 8 times of sales. This seems to be reasonable given the fast growing industry, its past 50% per year growth and long runway in the future. Although SharpSpring doesn't possess the same market leading position and the same liquidity, it could have higher growth prospective and slightly more pricing power (since its price for agencies is only 1/10 of its competitors', the agencies are relatively price insensitive given the lower base price, should both SharpSpring and its competitors increase their prices at the same percentage). As it grows, at some point, it may achieve similar awareness and much better liquidity to support a higher P/S valuation than what it has now. In a pretty conservative scenario, we estimate the revenue has the same linear growth as in 2016 for the next 3 years and also achieve positive EBTIDA in 3 years. This estimation essentially assumes the same linear growth instead of exponential growth and no reduction in churn rate (assumes churn rate to fix at 2.5%). The net revenue addition is assumed to be $0.4M per quarter, after 12 quarters, the run-rate revenue would be ($2.8M + $0.4M * 12) * 4 = $30.4M per year, and 3 times of sales (instead of 8 times in HubSpot's valuation) is $30.4M * 3 = $91.2M market cap. Diluted Share base is assumed to be 10 million shares after 3 years. The share price would be $91.2M / 10M = $9.12. Discount this back 3 years at 10% discount rate gives: $9.12 / 1.1^3 = $6.85 or 51% upside from the current price ($4.55).
 In a more aggressive scenario, we assume revenue grows 50% per year in the next 3 years, which matches HubSpot's past growth. This 50% per year growth assumption shouldn't be too aggressive since the 2016 revenue growth was 109%. The revenue after 3 years will be $11.2 * 1.5 ^ 3 = $37.8M. (Notice that this figure is not much more than the $30.4M in the linear growth scenario.) If it trades at 5 times of sales (or 8.3 times of gross profit), it would have a market cap of $189M, or $189M / 10M = $18.9 share price. Discount this back 3 years gives: $18.9 / 1.1 ^3 = $14.2 fair value, or 212% upside. Conclusion Generally speaking, it is very hard to value a high growth company, especially for an early stage one. Both the risk and the reward could be very big. For this kind of situation, it is probably better to take the same strategy as regular VC firms: build a small position and hold onto it for many years or even decades. I do think this specific case stand out by itself for a powerful combination of 3 elements which I usually look for: 1. A smart founder operator who works very hard and focused on investing for the long term. In terms of ownership, the CEO Rick Carlson owns 8% of the company, which is not very high, but that is due to a special situation (SMTP bought SharpSpring in 2014). We shouldn't forget the fact that he founded this firm by himself and saw it growing to this stage. He cares about providing the best service to customers and worked very hard on educating the public about SharpSpring and Marketing Automation, as shown in a recent presentation he did in an IZEA Fest event. 2. A pretty unique business model that has many merits and could serve as a foundation to power the growth without taking a lot of resources. This business model gives the firm a unique position to effectively compete with the market leader. 3. A fast growing industry. Everything being equal, the industry growth can provide some very powerful tail wind. Of course, that usually has to be coupled with good competitive strength in order to be sustainable for a firm.
 Other than the long growth pathway, it is also quite possible to see a potential acquisition here, since the company is quite small in terms of the market cap, and can be very valuable considering its unique position and existing customer base.

The U.S. focused company is often considered as a budget HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), itself a company worth considering an investment in. Customer reviews of SharpSpring tend to praise its low costs and its active involvement with clients. SharpSpring is also very much the junior to companies like HubSpot in other ways, from its micro-scale market cap of $39.2m, as against HUBS's $2.363bn, its share price, which at $4.47 is 6.5% of HUBS's value, to the returns its stock has generated over the past 12 months: approximately 10%, as against HUBS's 47.28%. At first glance, HubSpot, as an example of a rival in the automated marketing sector, is simply a safer and more attractive investment, and why back a potentially weak horse, when you can bet on the winner? This isn't necessarily a poor assessment, but SHSP does have a potentially significant longer-term upside. SHSP - One Year Share Price. Source: Bloomberg.

 Change, if not volatility, has been the watchword for anyone who's been following SharpSpring over the last several years, as the below graphic illustrates. Bought up by the company SMTP in August 2014, SharpSpring, during the next year effectively ate its parent company up from the inside out. As CEO Rick Carlson noted when SMTP changed its name to that of its erstwhile purchase, SharpSpring went from being "the smallest piece of the overall business to the largest piece." This is an impressive feat, made all the more so since it was achieved in just over a year. SHSP was bought by SMTP in August 2014, and by December 1st, 2015, the company had rebranded under the SharpSpring banner.
 SHSP History - Source: 

Tech Opportunities/Seeking Alpha SharpSpring, however, isn't just a feel-good narrative about the little acquisition that could. There is a lot to like about the micro-cap Florida-based company. The field SharpSpring operates in, it is true, already has several market leaders, and the company might be considered too small to properly compete in the marketing automation sector. That said, SharpSpring's agency and small business focus gives it a niche in which to operate. Focusing on selling to agencies which represent small businesses allows the company to keep costs low and channels its reach beyond what it could do on its own. SHSP's agency figures, the number of digital agencies it sells to on its books is actually quite a meaningful proportional share of the market. SharpSpring currently has 1,139 agencies on its books, and a total of 5,250 business users. Furthermore, the growth of SHSP's customer base from 2,925 at the end of 2015 to 5,250 by the start of 2017 is an excellent year's work. This means that by the end of 2016, SharpSpring almost doubled its user base and acquired 33% more new customers than it did in 2015. Lastly, and most impressively, SharpSpring, according to a Mirren-RSW/US report, posted the highest 2016 growth in industry usage levels, absorbed the highest proportion of available market share, and increased its core agency market penetration by a spectacular 440%. SHSP CEO, Rick Carlson, looks back on 2016. Source: Bloomberg.


 SharpSpring ranked second in the automated marketing for agencies space, again according to Mirren-RSW, also saw itself ranked on Deloitte's 2016 Technology Fast 500, and looking closer at the company's yearly performance, the highest returns available came with an April share purchase ($3.16), and an October sale ($5.75). This would have netted you a 45% return on your investment. Not bad for eight months. Since then, the company has twice reached similar highs and twice dropped to present lows, signaling some volatility around the stock. Current lows, it should be said, do not necessarily reflect the company's fundamentals, and with Q4 results in, there is plenty of reason to cheer. Q4 revenues are up 11% year on year, at $2.9m, with full year figures up 26%. Core product revenues have risen 109%. The company has completed the consolidation process following its divestment of SMTP and the aging GraphicMail, and remaining legacy aspects of this process are in managed decline. Q4 gross profit remained stable, but was a lower percentage of total revenue at 59%, down from 64%, and yearly gross profits were up 10% at $7m. Yearly gross margins have, however, fallen, as growth-targeted spending increases. The downside is that, as a company, SharpSpring still makes a net loss, reporting Q4 losses of $2.2m, or -$.26 a share, and yearly losses of $5.2m or -$1.51 a share. It's worth noting, however, that these figures are improvements, of 50 percent and 45 percent, respectively. EBITA losses disappointingly rose from $2.9m to $3.8m (-24%), whilst core losses, excluding amortization, acquisition-related costs, stock compensation expenses, and restructuring expenses, remained stable in value terms at $2.5m, but fell per share from -$.40 to $-.31 (+23%). SHSP Forecast Earnings. Source: Nasdaq


 There are reasons to be cautious about an investment in SharpSpring. The company, despite its excellent performance, is, in terms of spending power, a sheep amidst the wolves of the industry. Any investment at present, especially if long term in nature, risks dilution, given that SharpSpring is betting on an adjusted EBITDA break-even point being reached in Q4 2017. Cash reserves are falling, down from $11.6m in Q3 to $8.7m in Q4 (-25%). If this trend continues, by Q4 2017, cash reserves will have dwindled to just over $2m, and although CFO Ed Lawton expects "cash on hand and [SHSP's available] credit facility to remain an adequate source of funds", medium-term profitability is absolutely key to the company's strategy. Furthermore, owing to the company's size, SharpSpring might find itself forced to accept an M&A offer below a fair value, which would in turn damage any potential stock investment. The above said, with consolidation out of the way, and renewed focus generated by the fact that SharpSpring now has a single purpose: the growth of its marketing platform, there is plenty of upside potential for the company. Targeted investments have been made to support infrastructure and sales growth, which, while they will add to pressures on gross margins, are both necessary and likely to bear fruit. Indeed, SharpSpring's now narrowed focus has already seen increases in lead flow in Q1, as per its March earnings call, and R&D remains an investment focus. The Florida company has also boosted its partnerships, agreeing deals with Shutterstock (NYSE:SSTK), the world's leading stock photo provider, to boost its product offering, and Enthusem, a personalized mail targeting platform, in order to add further personalization to SharpSpring's advertising suite.

 SHSP - One Month Share Price Performance. Source: Bloomberg.

 As far as SHSP's current share price performance is concerned, there are some negative indications that would suggest holding fire for the moment. The company's stock has plunged by 18% in the past two days, suggesting that markets have digested the Q4 report and do not like what they have seen. Given that recently released figures are, from a long-term perspective, broadly positive, it is only possible to speculate as to the cause for the recent slump. Investor impatience, or worries about SharpSpring's long-term profitability, given the decline in the company's cash reserves, are certainly possible causes for SHSP's plunging share price. According to Stockinvest.us, trading volume in SHSP has also concurrently increased, however, on falling prices. This increases the risk of the sell-off around St. Patrick's Day continuing. Since January, SharpSpring has been slowly declining in value, with a February rally seemingly now going into reverse, so caution should be exercised in taking a position in the company until prices seem to have stabilized. The FT's Forecast for SHSP. Source: FT

 Putting aside the present share price decline for SharpSpring, which can also be seen as an opportunity to buy the company at a low, once its stock stabilizes, SHSP offers an interesting long-term investment route into the marketing automation industry. According to MarketsandMarkets, by 2019, this industry will reach $5.5bn in value, with a CAGR of 8.55%. SharpSpring is small, focused, and if it can manage to break even without the need of further capital investment, it is likely to see its share price take off. SHSP is a risky investment, and, despite its many impressive qualities and feats, it may find itself unable to stay the course, but SharpSpring certainly has both the product offering and the scope for growth in 2017.

Here is where we explain why you should work at SharpSpring.
But the difference is, here at SharpSpring we really mean it.




			All open positions		


 

 
 
1













 SharpSpring is an innovative, entrepreneurial company that is transforming the way digital marketing is done. We are pioneering the marketing automation and email marketing industry and we’re growing.



We're looking for people who like working in small teams, but are excited about being part of a global organization. If you have an entrepreneurial spirit, take ownership of your work, and want to be part of a community of pioneering minds, you’ve found the right place.
At SharpSpring, you won’t be another cog in a giant wheel. You’ll work on small collaborative teams, interacting with all levels of employees. There is a synergetic vibe here, so you’ll probably have a buddy to walk for coffee or a snack. Co-workers quickly become friends (even bandmates). We have the unique atmosphere of a startup coupled with an established customer base and the foundation for explosive growth. Jump in.

 



People

Our people drive our business. If you are top in your field, committed to your work and ready to grow, SharpSpring may be the right fit for you. Collaboration and teamwork aren’t just words on signs; they are a way of life here.
Just a few years ago, we had four people in the Gainesville office. We've jumped to 140 and we’ve got our sights set on 200. But make no mistake – we’re picky. We are deliberate in our hiring to ensure we’re getting the right fit.

And here is what our leaders have to say.
Hey there. Thanks for checking out SharpSpring. We are very proud and humbled to be leading this company. It long since outgrew us and it truly belongs to the dedicated team members that work here everyday. That environment is a huge contributor to our success. We are attracting the best and the brightest – people who are engaged and want to provide exceptional products and service to clients. Sound cool? If so, we’d like to meet you personally to see if you’ll fit into our team. Come on over to the next Buzz event or send us a resume. We’re growing like crazy and you might fit right in.
Warmly,
Rick Carlson, CEO
Travis Whitton, CTO
Ed Lawton, CFO

 

Culture

It's kind of cool how our products and our culture mirror each other.
Marketing automation platforms used to be out of reach to small and medium sized businesses. SharpSpring is breaking that boundary, allowing all companies to access the best technology and compete. At the same time, we're the little guy - competing with companies 10 times the size of us and winning. That underdog mentality is at the core of our culture.
At SharpSpring, you'll find people who are committed to producing every day. Here's what you won't find: "no" people, "we've always done it this way" guy, politics, slackers and dead weight. We're supportive of each other, all working to achieve. Our company is transparent, and our leadership is present and working at the same crazy pace. We hire slowly, looking for the right people. Around the office, you'll see a lot of fun, cool people working hard. We're serious but casual, respectful but not uptight. There are a lot of smiling people in these pictures, and rest assured the smiles are genuine. We care about our community and in addition to executive volunteering and mentoring, we are committed to Giving Back as often as we can.



SharpSpring is for you, no matter if you are a...

														Barrington Senior Software Developer 
“At SharpSpring, you can see your direct impact on the growth and direction of the company and are able to get immediate feedback from customers, managers and executives alike. Its great to be a part of a situation where you know your worth and you know your contributions are valued.”




 


														Naseem  Senior Project Manager 
"I love being surrounded by the smart, creative people at SharpSpring. We have the freedom to improvise and try new things, and working here challenges me to learn more and grow everyday."




 


														Joel VP Business Development 
“The best part of working here is the strong SharpSpring community - it's like working with your best friends. Everyone is here to make a difference, not just a paycheck. Being a part of SharpSpring makes me feel proud that I'm working with so many driven and talented people to deliver an incredible product.”



 



Work
SharpSpring helps thousands of marketing agencies and small/mid-sized businesses in more than 20 countries compete on a global scale.
Marketing automation used to be out of reach for these businesses. SharpSpring is breaking that boundary and bringing these functions to companies of all sizes, effectively leveling the playing field.

We’re accountable to our customers — real people working to grow their companies. We are committed to helping customers achieve success.
Already in IT? Here are some things that set us apart from other shops:
Product, Not Client Work
Forget one-off projects. At SharpSpring, you can make a lasting, tangible impact. You’ll be on a dedicated team that develops and nurtures our platform. The code you write doesn’t sit on a shelf — it is used by real people so you see the immediate results of your contributions.







Development at Scale
Our server infrastructure is distributed across the globe, and our unique clustering architecture processes many millions of impressions per day. We use the latest container-driven technologies to dynamically scale our network, and if you're a data geek, our automation engine is a data playground that you're sure to love.



Cool Technology
To keep our teams challenged and offer the best to our clients we work with the latest technologies. Some of our favorites are Docker, Kubernetes, CoreOS, Golang, Clojure, ElasticSearch, Redis, Sphinx, Backbone.js, Node.js and Nginx. And sometimes we go old school with Linux, PHP, Python, JavaScript, Memcached and LAMP Stack.
 


 



Benefits
We take care of our employees
401(k) with company match, 4 weeks paid time off for eligible employees, MacBooks, Paid life insurance, Pre-tax medical, dental and vision insurance, HSA, Bonus structure, Stock Options, 8 paid holidays, Flexible work schedule

In addition to having a casual, friendly workplace, we like to have a few extras to keep our team feeling good.





 


														Company Lunch													
Twice a month, we bring in lunch for employees to make their Friday just a little bit happier.




 


														Massage													
Feeling stressed? Chill out with a massage. A massage therapist drops by every couple of weeks to help us work out the kinks. 




 


														Happy Hour													
Every other week, we host Buzz - a happy hour event where all Gainesville IT professionals are invited for some tasty beverages and camaraderie.




 


														Car Detailing													
Need a car detail? We have a guy come to the office for that, too.

SharpSpring is for Developers

Look, if you're a top developer, we know you can work almost anywhere. But there are reasons why many of
                our devs have turned down work at Google, LinkedIn and other major companies. Developers are the
                lifeblood of our company, and we make it a priority to attract only the very best people by offering
                something unique.

I’ve used other automated marketing platforms at another agency, however they are wildly expensive and more geared towards large business.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
