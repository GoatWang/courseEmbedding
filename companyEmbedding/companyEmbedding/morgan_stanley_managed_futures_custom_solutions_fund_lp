* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.45% for DXMAX, 2.20% for DXMCX, and 1.20% for DXMIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

        Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.
 

 



        Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.
 

 



        A Correlation Misconception

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Provides institutions and ultra-high net worth individuals with a customized managed futures investment designed according to client-specific risk/return




















					Investment Approach






 
 



Investment Approach




Philosophy

Ceres Managed Futures LLC (Ceres), an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, serves as general partner and commodity pool operator to Morgan Stanley's managed futures funds.   
In general, the primary objective of the funds managed by Ceres is to provide absolute returns that diversify an investor’s portfolio with low to no correlation to traditional investments (i.e., equities and fixed income) and other alternative investment strategies. 
For a custom portfolio, Ceres works with the investor to define their investment objectives and risk/return targets, as well as establishing the expectations and attributes associated with such.
The ultimate goal of Ceres' investment process is to identify and invest with commodity trading advisors (CTAs) who have the potential to add value to the custom portfolio and the investor's overall portfolio from both an absolute return and diversification standpoint.




 
Differentiators


Experience and Expertise




Ceres' team consists of highly experienced and vastly knowledgeable professionals dedicated exclusively to the structuring and monitoring of fund portfolios allocating to registered commodity trading advisors (CTAs).




Reputation




Given Morgan Stanley's worldwide brand recognition and Ceres' strong reputation and presence in the managed futures industry, CTAs and other service providers are quite often willing and accommodating in order to have the opportunity to be business partners with us.




Extensive Product Platform 




Our wide-ranging set of product offerings provides qualified individual and institutional investors with the potential to meet their investment objectives and help diversify traditional and alternative investment portfolios.




Comprehensive Due Diligence and Manager Selection Process




In order to be considered and selected for inclusion in one of our funds, a CTA must endure a thorough investment and operational due diligence review, as well as demonstrate attributes (pedigree/background, trading approach, technology, etc.) that help to differentiate them from other CTAs in the funds and across the managed futures industry.











 
 







 
Investment Process


1
Sourcing





CTAs who are candidates for a potential investment allocation from our funds are sourced from Ceres' expansive network of contacts, as well as identified through screening of databases and from various industry-related events and conferences.  In order to qualify for investment consideration, a CTA must first meet specific minimum criteria related to length of track record, assets under management, and investor concentration levels.  The team's investment professionals actively monitor the CTA universe and maintain an ongoing dialogue with CTAs to remain informed of new entrants into the industry, the evolution of organizations and trading strategies, CTA performance relative to the current economic environment/market cycle, product innovation and application, and distribution trends.




2
Due Diligence & Analysis





Ceres conducts comprehensive due diligence of all CTAs considered for potential inclusion in one or more of our funds.  Due diligence of the CTA consists of a quantitative analysis and qualitative review of various aspects of a CTA, including, but not limited to:  investment strategy and trading approach;  historical returns  (performance over various time periods, sector/style attribution, absolute and relative returns, etc.), risk attributes (volatility measures, decline periods, portfolio efficiency, etc.); correlations versus other CTAs and asset classes; margin and leverage utilization; research processes; adherence to policies and procedures; organizational structure and personnel; primary third-party service providers; technology; contingency operational capital; and disaster recovery plans.




3
Portfolio Construction and CTA Selection





When constructing a portfolio, we initiate the process by defining the risk/return objectives and our long-term expectations. CTAs are then selected based upon whether or not we believe they have the potential to help the fund meet its objectives, enhance its risk/return ratio, minimize the magnitude of its drawdowns, or provide it with additional trading style or market diversification.  The confidence we have in the CTAs we select relies upon our due diligence process, as well as on additional analysis we perform including analysis of the CTAs' performance relative to a fund's fees and the fee terms we negotiate with the CTAs, review of correlations to the other CTAs in the fund's portfolio, and determination of what specific market instruments will be traded in the fund in order to adhere with regulatory requirements.




4
Approval and Governance





All proposals for a new fund or to add a CTA to a fund must first be reviewed by Ceres' Investment Management Committee and then presented to Ceres' Board of Directors for consideration and approval.




5
Ongoing Portfolio Management and Monitoring





Ceres views portfolio management and risk monitoring as equally as critical as the initial due diligence and portfolio construction processes.  As such, we assess, assign, and manage risks in several ways, relying upon assorted means to do so.  For instance, once a fund allocates to a CTA and trading is initiated, Ceres actively monitors the CTA and underlying fund(s) on an ongoing basis ranging from intra-day real-time performance, market, and trade monitoring to daily next-day review and analysis of P&L, margin commitments, positioning, and trading.  Longer-term strategic evaluations of a CTA are also conducted, particularly in relation to a CTA's performance relative to its historical profile, its peer group, and Ceres' overall expectations.  This includes various reviews performed monthly, quarterly, annually, and "as warranted".  Likewise, tactical portfolio rebalancing and allocation adjustments are implemented as often as monthly to account for the current market environment and, subsequently, the potential opportunities and underlying risks to the funds and CTAs.

This is prepared for sophisticated investors who are capable of understanding the risks associated with the investments described herein and may not be appropriate for you.  The information presented represents how the portfolio management team generally implements its investment process under normal market conditions.
All information provided has been prepared solely for information purposes and does not constitute an offer or a recommendation to buy or sell any particular security or to adopt any specific investment strategy. The information herein has not been based on a consideration of any individual investor circumstances and is not investment advice, nor should it be construed in any way as tax, accounting, legal or regulatory advice. To that end, investors should seek independent legal and financial advice, including advice as to tax consequences, before making any investment decision.  There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will work under all market conditions, and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest for the long-term, especially during periods of downturn in the market. 
Any views and opinions provided are those of the portfolio management team and are subject to change at any time due to market or economic conditions and may not necessarily come to pass. Furthermore, the views will not be updated or otherwise revised to reflect information that subsequently becomes available or circumstances existing, or changes occurring. The views expressed do not reflect the opinions of all portfolio managers at Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) or the views of the firm as a whole, and may not be reflected in all the strategies and products that the Firm offers.
Diversification does not protect you against a loss in a particular market; however it allows you to spread that risk across various asset classes.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Alternative investments are speculative and include a high degree of risk. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. Alternative investments are suitable only for long-term investors willing to forego liquidity and put capital at risk for an indefinite period of time. Alternative investments are typically highly illiquid – there is no secondary market for private funds, and there may be restrictions on redemptions or assigning or otherwise transferring investments into private funds. Alternative investment funds often engage in leverage and other speculative practices that may increase volatility and risk of loss. Alternative investments typically have higher fees and expenses than other investment vehicles, and such fees and expenses will lower returns achieved by investors.
In the ordinary course of its business, Morgan Stanley engages in a broad spectrum of activities including, among others, financial advisory services, investment banking, asset management activities and sponsoring and managing private investment funds. In engaging in these activities, the interest of Morgan Stanley may conflict with the interests of clients.
Funds of funds often have a higher fee structure than single manager funds as a result of the additional layer of fees. Alternative investment funds are often unregulated, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, and are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors. The investment strategies described in the preceding pages may not be suitable for your specific circumstances; accordingly, you should consult your own tax, legal or other advisors, at both the outset of any transaction and on an ongoing basis, to determine such suitability.
A separately managed account may not be suitable for all investors. Separate accounts managed according to the Strategy include a number of securities and will not necessarily track the performance of any index. Please consider the investment objectives, risks and fees of the Strategy carefully before investing. A minimum asset level is required. For important information about the investment manager, please refer to Form ADV Part 2.
No investment should be made without proper consideration of the risks and advice from your tax, accounting, legal or other advisors as you deem appropriate.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.45% for DXMAX, 2.20% for DXMCX, and 1.20% for DXMIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
