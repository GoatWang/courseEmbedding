(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Company Overview  R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company ("RR Donnelley," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our"), a Delaware corporation, helps organizations communicate more effectively by working to create, manage, produce, distribute and process content on behalf of our customers. The Company assists customers in developing and executing multichannel communication strategies that engage audiences, reduce costs, drive revenues and increase compliance. R.R. Donnelley's innovative technologies enhance digital and print communications to deliver integrated messages across multiple media to highly targeted audiences at optimal times for clients in virtually every private and public sector. Strategically located operations provide local service and responsiveness while leveraging the economic, geographic and technological advantages of a global organization.  Segment Descriptions  The Company's segments and their product and service offerings are summarized below:  Publishing and Retail Services  The Publishing and Retail Services segment's primary product offerings include magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books, directories and packaging.  Variable Print  The Variable Print segment includes the Company's U.S. short-run and transactional printing operations. This segment's primary product offerings include commercial and digital print, office products, direct mail, labels, statement printing, forms and packaging.  Strategic Services  The Strategic Services segment includes the Company's logistics services, financial print products and related services, print management offerings, digital and creative solutions and book publishing.  International  The International segment includes the Company's non-U.S. printing operations in Asia, Europe, Latin America and Canada. This segment's primary product and service offerings include magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, books, directories, direct mail, packaging, forms, labels, manuals, statement printing, commercial and digital print, logistics services and digital and creative solutions. Additionally, this segment includes the Company's business process outsourcing and Global Turnkey Solutions operations. Business process outsourcing provides transactional print and outsourcing services, statement printing, direct mail and print management offerings through its operations in Europe, Asia and North America. Global Turnkey Solutions provides outsourcing capabilities, including product configuration, customized kitting and order fulfillment for technology, medical device and other companies around the world through its operations in Europe, North America and Asia.  Corporate  Corporate consists of unallocated selling, general and administrative activities and associated expenses including, in part, executive, legal, finance, communications, certain facility costs and LIFO inventory provisions. In addition, certain costs and earnings of employee benefit plans, such as pension and other postretirement benefits plan expense and share-based compensation, are included in Corporate and not allocated to the operating segments. Corporate also manages the Company's cash pooling structures, which enables participating international locations to draw on the Company's overseas cash resources to meet local liquidity needs.  Products and Services  The Company separately reports its net sales, related costs of sales and gross profit for its product and service offerings. The Company's product offerings primarily consist of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts, commercial and digital print, books, financial print, statement printing, office products, direct mail, labels, packaging, forms, manuals and other related products procured through the Company's print management offering and directories. The Company's service offerings primarily consist of logistics, EDGAR-related and eXtensible Business Reporting Language ("XBRL") financial services, certain business outsourcing services and digital and creative solutions.  Proposed Spinoff Transactions  On August 4, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors intends to create three independent public companies: (i) a financial communications services company with 2015 net sales of $1.0 billion ("Donnelley Financial Solutions"), (ii) a publishing and retail-centric print services company with 2015 net sales of $3.7 billion ("LSC Communications"), and (iii) a multichannel communications management company with estimated 2015 net sales of approximately $6.8 billion ("RR Donnelley & Sons Company"). Estimated 2015 net sales for RR Donnelley & Sons Company reflects the elimination of intercompany transactions; as a result net sales for RR Donnelley & Sons Company may differ on a standalone basis. Donnelley Financial Solutions is expected to consist of the current financial reporting unit of the Company's Strategic Services segment. LSC Communications is expected to consist of the Company's current Publishing and Retail Services segment, as well as the current office products reporting unit of the Company's Variable Print segment, substantially all of the operations currently within the Europe reporting unit of the Company's International segment, certain Mexican operations currently within the Latin America reporting unit of the Company's International segment and the co-mail and related list services operations currently within the logistics reporting unit of the Company's Strategic Services segment. RR Donnelley & Sons Company is expected to consist of the Company's current Variable Print segment (except for the office products reporting unit that will become part of LSC Communications), the current logistics reporting unit of the Company's Strategic Services segment (except for the operations that will become part of LSC Communications), the current sourcing and digital and creative solutions reporting units of the Company's Strategic Services segment, and the Company's current International segment (except for substantially all of the Europe reporting unit and certain Mexican operations that will become part of LSC Communications). The proposed transactions are expected to take the form of a tax-free distribution to RR Donnelley shareholders of at least 80% of the shares of common stock in Donnelley Financial Solutions and LSC Communications.  Donnelley Financial Solutions and LSC Communications each filed a Form 10 on March 31, 2016, which were subsequently amended on June 7, 2016. Additionally, the expected leadership of the three companies was announced in the Company's Form 8-K filed on April 13, 2016. The transactions are subject to customary conditions, including obtaining rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (which the Company has received) and/or tax opinions, execution of inter-company agreements and final approval by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company expects to complete the transactions in October 2016, but there can be no assurance that the transactions will be completed on the anticipated timeline, or at all, or that the terms of the transactions will not change. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, of Part I of the Company's 2015 Form 10-K filed on February 25, 2016 and Item 1A of Part II under "Risk Factors" below for certain risk factors relating to the proposed transactions. The disclosures within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are on a consolidated Company basis, reflect the Company's current operating and management structure, and do not take into account the proposed transactions.  Upon separation, the historical results of Donnelley Financial Solutions and LSC Communications will be presented as discontinued operations.  Business Acquisitions and Dispositions  On January 11, 2016, the Company sold two entities within the business process outsourcing reporting unit.  On June 8, 2015, the Company acquired Courier Corporation ("Courier"), a leader in digital printing and publishing primarily in the United States, specializing in educational, religious and trade books.  On April 29, 2015, the Company sold its 50.1% interest in its Venezuelan operating entity.  For further information on the above acquisitions and dispositions, see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Executive Overview  Second Quarter Overview  Net sales decreased by $18.4 million, or 0.7%, for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year. On a proforma basis, the Company's net sales decreased by $81.1 million, or 2.9% (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). There was a $24.4 million, or 0.9%, decrease due to foreign exchange rates. In addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates, the decrease in net sales was due to lower volume in the International and Variable Print segments, price pressures, a decrease in fuel surcharges in the logistics reporting unit, and a $5.1 million decline in pass-through paper sales. These items were partially offset by higher volume, primarily in the Publishing and Retail Services segment, as a result of the acquisition of Courier, and increased volume in the Strategic Services segment.  The Company continues to take actions across all platforms to reduce its cost structure and enhance productivity. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company realized cost savings from restructuring activities including the reorganization of administrative and support functions across all segments and facility consolidations and reorganizations across platforms. Additional cost savings were realized as a result of synergies from the integration of Courier.  Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $100.3 million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $61.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflected the timing of supplier and customer payments, higher spinoff-related transaction expenses and higher payments for taxes, partially offset by lower payments for incentive compensation.  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company communicated to retirees the option to receive a lump-sum pension payment or annuity with payments beginning in the second quarter of 2016. A portion of the eligible participants elected to receive a lump-sum pension payment or annuity and as a result the Company's pension assets and liabilities were remeasured as of the payout date. As a result of the remeasurement, the Company recorded a non-cash settlement charge of $96.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2016 (see Note 7, Employee Benefits, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).  In connection with the proposed spinoff transactions, the Company incurred spinoff-related transaction expenses of $18.4 million and $30.3 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. The Company expects to incur a significant amount of spinoff-related transaction and transition expenses in 2016, including debt refinancing, information technology, consulting, real estate and other incremental expenses.

Venezuela currency remeasurement: currency remeasurement in Venezuela and the related impact of the devaluation resulted in a pre-tax loss of $0.4 million ($1.2 million after-tax) for the three months ended June 30, 2015, of which $0.2 million was included in loss attributable to noncontrolling interests.  Operations: reflected price pressures, unfavorable mix in the Strategic Services segment, lower volume in the Variable Print segment and increased bad debt expense, partially offset by the acquisition of Courier, including synergies from the integration, and lower depreciation and amortization expense.

See further details in the review of operating results by segment that follows below.  OUTLOOK  Competitive Environment  Technological changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data, online distribution and hosting of media content, and advances in digital printing, print-on-demand and Internet technologies, continue to impact the market for the Company's products and services. One of the Company's competitive strengths is that it offers a wide array of communications products and services, including print, which provide differentiated solutions for its customers. The Company works with its customers to create, manage, deliver and optimize their multi-channel communications strategies. The Company has and will continue to develop and expand its creative and design, content management, digital and print production, supply chain management and distribution services to address its customers' evolving needs while supporting the strategic objective of becoming a leading global provider of integrated communication services.  The print and related services industry, in general, continues to have excess capacity and remains highly competitive. Despite consolidation in recent years, the industry remains highly fragmented. Across the Company's range of products and services, competition is based primarily on price in addition to quality and the ability to service the special needs of customers. Management expects that prices for the Company's products and services will continue to be a focal point for customers in coming years. Therefore, the Company believes it needs to continue to lower its cost structure and continue to differentiate its product and service offerings.  Digital technologies have impacted printed retail inserts, magazines and catalogs as some advertiser spending has moved from print to electronic media. Electronic communication and transaction technology has eliminated or reduced the role of many traditional printed products and has continued to drive electronic substitution in directory and statement printing, in part driven by environmental concerns and cost pressures at key customers. In recent years, the trend in e-book substitution has shifted and the publishing industry has experienced growth in consumer print book volume, while sales of e-books have declined. The future impact of technology on the Company's business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, the Company has made targeted acquisitions and investments to offer customers innovative services and solutions that further secure the Company's position as a technology leader in the industry.  The acquisition of Courier supports the Company's strategic objective of generating profitable growth and improved cash flow and liquidity through targeted acquisitions. The acquisition has enhanced the Company's existing capabilities and ability to serve its customers and has provided cost savings through the combination of best practices, complementary products and manufacturing and distribution capabilities.  The Company has implemented a number of strategic initiatives to reduce its overall cost structure and improve efficiency, including the restructuring, reorganization and integration of operations and streamlining of administrative and support activities. Future cost reduction initiatives could include the reorganization of operations and the consolidation of facilities. Implementing such initiatives might result in future restructuring or impairment charges, which may be substantial. Management also reviews the Company's operations and management structure on a regular basis to balance appropriate risks and opportunities to maximize efficiencies and to support the Company's long-term strategic goals. Additionally, to align with its long-term strategic goals, the Company announced that it intends to create three independent public companies and expects the transactions to be effective in October 2016. The proposed spinoff transactions will allow each business to pursue their own strategies and invest according to the unique dynamics of their respective industries. Refer to Proposed Spinoff Transactions for further details regarding the proposed spinoff transactions.  Seasonality  Advertising and consumer spending trends affect demand in several of the end-markets served by the Company. Historically, demand for printing of magazines, catalogs, retail inserts and books is higher in the second half of the year driven by increased advertising pages within magazines, and holiday volume in catalogs, retail inserts and books. Partially offsetting this pattern, . . .  Aug 03, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
