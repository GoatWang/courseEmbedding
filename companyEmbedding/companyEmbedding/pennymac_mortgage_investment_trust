PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE: PMT) is a specialty 
finance company that invests in a variety of residential mortgage loans and mortgage-related 
assets. The Company's objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to 
its shareholders over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily 
through capital appreciation.

PMT’s targeted investments are in the U.S. residential mortgage 
market. We are primarily focused on investing in distressed mortgage loans available 
for acquisition from financial institutions and engaging in correspondent lending.


PMT is managed by PNMAC Capital Management, LLC (“PCM” or our 
“Manager”), a subsidiary of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. ("PennyMac") and an 
investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) 
that specializes in, and focuses on, residential mortgage assets. All of the loans 
we acquire in our correspondent lending operations are acquired, pooled for sale, 
sold and/or securitized on our behalf by another PennyMac subsidiary, PennyMac Loan 
Services, LLC (“PLS” or our “Servicer”), which also services most of the loans we 
hold in our investment portfolio and almost all of the loans for which we retain 
the obligation to service as a result of our correspondent lending operations.


PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment 
trust (REIT) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The company's stock trades on 
the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PMT.

Why PennyMac?










We service the loans we originate — Unlike most lenders, we stay committed to our customers throughout the life of the loan. When you originate a loan with PennyMac, we’ll service your loan because we value your trust and decision to choose us.







No expensive brick-and-mortar retail offices — We believe in passing on the savings to our customers with low, competitive rates and fees available today.







A full range of loan products and beneficial services —  PennyMac’s Pre-qualification Certificate, for example, helps you understand how much you can afford before you start shopping. Your offer will stand out, and because you've put some of the paperwork behind you, your loan can close more quickly.













My loan officer worked very hard to ensure that our house refinance loan was processed in a short window of time so that it would be completed before our scheduled trip out of the country.

I like to thank Carlos Robles and Richard Kennimer. They were both very helpful and I greatly appreciated their assistance throughout the process. They made it easy to process the loan and hand in the required paperwork. The document upload process was simplified using the PennyMac secure website with my own personal account.

Our Mission
As a top national mortgage lender, PennyMac is committed to providing its customers with a range of innovative solutions to help them purchase, refinance or simply remain in their homes. Whether they’re new to the home loan process or experienced buyers specifically seeking a competitive conventional, FHA or VA loan, PennyMac is dedicated to offering competitive rates and superior service.
Being a direct mortgage lender means PennyMac can focus on the needs of its customers rather than maintaining a network of branches and banking products. The company’s licensed loan officers are trained to help customers through the process every step of the way.
Since its founding in 2008, PennyMac has sought to restore Americans’ trust in home ownership by improving the quality and consistency of the mortgage lending experience.
The company offers multiple options to help prospective customers buy, refinance or simply stay in their homes.  PennyMac has participated in the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), federal programs created in 2009 to help customers in need of financial assistance remain in their homes. PennyMac also buys loans from banks and other lenders, using its expertise to help customers restructure their mortgages so they can stay in their homes. As a major loan servicer, the company also supports more than 1,000,000 PennyMac home loan customers.

PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. is a specialty financial services 
                firm with a comprehensive mortgage platform and integrated business 
                focused on the production and servicing of U.S. mortgage loans and 
                the management of investments related to the U.S. mortgage market.
PennyMac Financial was founded in 2008 by members of our executive 
                leadership team and two strategic partners, BlackRock Mortgage Ventures, 
                LLC and HC Partners, LLC, formerly known as Highfields Capital Investments, 
                LLC. Since then, we have built what we believe is an industry-leading 
                operational platform to pursue business opportunities in the U.S. 
                mortgage market. We have a strong track record of performance and 
                earnings growth, driven by solid execution of our growth strategies 
                while remaining focused on quality and governance.
PennyMac Financial operates in three business segments: Loan 
                Production, Loan Servicing and Investment Management. As of 
                December 31, 2016, we are the 4th largest originator and the 11th largest 
                servicer in the U.S. according to Inside Mortgage Finance. In our 
                Investment Management business, we manage private investment funds 
                and PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE: PMT), a publicly-traded 
                mortgage REIT. PMT is a tax-efficient vehicle for investing in 
                mortgage-related assets and a capital partner that helps reduce 
                our balance sheet requirements compared to a typical mortgage company.
We believe that PennyMac Financial is a unique company in the 
                U.S. mortgage sector. We have a diversified business model that 
                includes complementary strategies that have generated strong and 
                growing profits across a range of market environments. We believe 
                that the deep experience of our senior management and our strong 
                commitment to corporate governance, compliance, and risk management 
                are essential to PennyMac Financial's continued success and long-term 
                growth.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
