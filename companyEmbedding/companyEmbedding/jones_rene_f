OverviewFree PreviewAbout The AuthorCustomer ReviewEditorial Review






This book is not designed to explore well-known marketing concepts. Instead, it is intended to look at applied, practical, and proven marketing approaches in a proactive manner that is designed to improve the nature and quality of architectural practice as well as that of other design professionals. It is primarily about the services offered by architectural and small design firms, but it also has as much to do with the notion of change within the design professions as it does with marketing concepts. As a result, the reader may find some thoughts and ideas somewhat provocative, but is intended primarily to bring a new perspective on the practice. Because of changing trends and rapidly changing market conditions, we must, as design professionals, prepare ourselves to communicate and interact with a much broader segment of society, even those who are not potential clients.

BUFFALO, N.Y., April 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- M&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:   MTB)("M&T") announced today that Vice Chairman René F. Jones will undertake new managerial responsibilities effective May 2.  In addition to his continuing oversight of the bank's Treasury function and Wilmington Trust division, he adds two new business lines, Mortgage and Consumer Lending.

							 		Darren J. King, Executive Vice President, M&T Bank
							  




 
 

 

 
 



"As our Chief Financial Officer, René has helped guide M&T successfully through one of the most challenging 10-year periods in our company's history, and today we're stronger than ever," said M&T Chairman and CEO, Robert G. Wilmers.  "I know René will bring the same vision and values to his new work with our banking products, customers and employees."  
Mr. Jones joined M&T in 1992 and has held a series of management positions within the Finance division.  He was promoted to Chief Financial Officer and joined the bank's Management Group in 2005, and he was named Vice Chairman in January 2014.    
M&T also announced that Executive Vice President Darren J. King will become Chief Financial Officer.  "Both as the leader of one of our largest and most important businesses and as a member of the bank's Management Group, Darren has demonstrated a deep understanding of the banking business, a keenly analytical mind and a strong strategic vision of M&T's role in our communities and in our industry, and I am confident that Darren's strengths will serve us well as M&T's next CFO," said Mr. Wilmers.  
As head of M&T's Retail and Business Banking divisions, Mr. King has been responsible for more than 6,700 employees, 800 branches and 1,600 ATMs serving 2.1 million households.  
Mr. King joined M&T in 2000, and was named to the Management Group in 2010.  His experience in the financial services industry spans more than 25 years and includes senior leadership roles at Mercer Management Consulting, predecessor firm to Oliver Wyman, where he was Vice President in the Financial Services Practice.
"These changes are part of our ongoing effort to deepen and develop our managerial talent as the company grows," explained Mr. Wilmers.
M&T is a financial holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York.  M&T's principal banking subsidiary, M&T Bank, operates banking offices in New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.  Trust-related services are provided by M&T's Wilmington Trust-affiliated companies and by M&T Bank.

Bridget Jones, the walking ad: How Renee Zellweger's new movie's packed with product plugs (v.v.lucrative!)

Bridget Jones's Baby opened earlier this month and is a critical and box office hit.Everyone has fallen back in love with Bridget, the daffy diarist played by Renee Zellweger, who is older, almost wiser and accidentally pregnant by one of her two lovers.Yet as the two-hour film spools through the zany 'who's-the-daddy' plot, something else is going on in the background — something much more devious. 





 





SAINSBURY’S BAG, MULBERRY HANDBAG AND SHRIMPS COAT (left): Have just done my Sainsbury’s shop, like an ordinary person. Look how normal self can be! Am also carrying a Mulberry Bayswater handbag (£950) and wearing fluffy coat (£498) from trendy Shrimps shop. How on earth can I afford all this expensive stuff? JUICER (right): Have to drink healthy veg juice made in my Breville Blend Active (£60). Plus still wearing my Tiffany necklace (£250). Everyone copied me, even little Emma Watson  





 MOTORBIKE: Clearly am still wanton sex goddess, making handsome billionaire Jack Qwant (Patrick Dempsey) fall madly in love with self while astride his classic Royal Enfield motorbike (about £3,000)In subtle but very persuasive ways, cinema-goers are bombarded with sneaky advertising from the opening scenes until the credits roll.The whole film is rife with product placement; the kind of silent, stealth marketing that adds untold riches to a movie's profit margins.

From the branded Clearblue pregnancy testing kit Bridget uses to confirm her impending motherhood to the tube of Pringles she snacks upon in a moment of Bridget-ian crisis, she is a walking billboard upon which an astonishing variety of merchandise and commodities are advantageously displayed.She wears identifiable bobble hats and cashmere cardigans from the chic Brora woollen company, she walks across London's Tower Bridge in a £400 Diane von Furstenberg lace wrap-dress and is at a celebration where Taittinger champagne is notably served.






 





 





DIANE VON FURSTENBERG (left): Yes, still feel like an idiot most of time, but not when swanning around looking like total goddess in Diane von Furstenberg lace wrap-dress (£420) and Dolce & Gabbana shoes (£265). SAMSONITE HOLDALL(right): Everyone knows uptight lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) has baggage. All those ex-wives —and this butch £159 holdall from Samsonite. Perfect for a mini-break?  





 KRISPY KREME: Do you mind if I stand behind this picturesque sign for a moment? Obv this is a v.v. excellent way of securing a lifetime’s supply of free doughnuts 





 





iPHONE (left): Unfairness of life still vexing, smug marrieds still annoying but in the meantime, can everyone see my iPhone if I hold it like this? Thank you, job done. iPAD (right): Self no longer scratches away with writing instrument on boring paper. Self tap-taps words of infinite wisdom into this machine (Apple Ipad Pro, £639). Am doing best sex bomb smirk and holding it up so entire populace can see!Elsewhere, she and a friend buy wellingtons from the fashionable Muck boot company, she tucks into an Ottolenghi takeaway and she obviously does her food shopping at Sainsbury's, as she is seen lugging its distinctive orange carrier bags home with the logos all nicely displayed.Of course, the big deals between household brands and film companies are strictly confidential, but some companies are just delighted to be included in a box office smash.Muck, for example, supplied its footwear and pop‑up shop free. 'We didn't pay them and they didn't pay us. We were just thrilled to be connected to Bridget,' said a spokesman.One can imagine that is not the case with some of the others.It is all very different from the first film Bridget Jones's Diary, released in 2001.Yes, it is true that Bridget still wears her iconic Elsa Peretti open heart necklace from Tiffany and celebrity magazines are still strewn around her London flat (first time around it was Hello! — in the new film she favours OK!). 






 





 





PINK SUITCASE (left): Disaster at pop festival. My rock chick cool has sunk in the mud, with my Guess La Vida Logo pin-wheeled suitcase (£115). Luckily, hunky Patrick Dempsey is here to help. BRORA (right): I wear its bobble hat (£115) and scarf (£125). All cashmere, all gorgeous, all as furry as my chin before monthly waxing. Hormones are all to hell!  





 CLEARBLUE PREGNANCY STICK: Am trying to be poised and cool ice queen, but appear to be up the duff by person unknown. Monstrous sluttage! Must do better to be good girl. Thank goodness for this v. handy stick thing, (£12.99) which I am holding so you can see all the words. Conception indicator v.v. good, but no Mark Darcy button. Bah!But back then, there was none of the relentless product placement which embosses the latest film.During one scene in the new movie she removes a Chateau de Sable babygrow from its monogrammed packaging and stares at it as if she had just unwrapped the Eighth Wonder of the World.And it goes without saying that she no longer writes her diary in a non-specific red leather journal. She now taps it out on an Apple iPad — prominently seen in the poster campaign.Perhaps this change in advertising circumstances is because in the old days, our 'Bridg' was a penniless underling in a publishing firm, a drone who wore generic skirts and shapeless coats.  





 BABYGROW: Check out this Chateau de Sable Boo Bodysuit (£19.99). Have not consumed single alcohol unit nor cheese slice since circa 2010, but how will self ever fit into this? Sink into morbid despair over fat thighsToday, she is a thriving TV news producer, a successful 43-year-old singleton with more money to spend. But she is still loveable, dotty and mixed up, which makes millions of women identify with her — and turns her into an advertiser's dream.Product placement is nothing new, of course. However, it is Bridget Jones who is leading the way on the big screen at the moment.She no longer smokes or counts calories, which is perhaps a blessing — but as you can see here, everything else in her calamitous life has been carefully mapped out not by fate or the stars, but by v.v. clever advertising.Picture research: Claire Cisotti
