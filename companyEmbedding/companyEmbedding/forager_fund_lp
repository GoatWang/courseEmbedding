                        ABOUT
                    
With funds under management in excess of $320 million and an exclusive focus on long-term investing, Forager Funds is a unique Australian asset management company.
After seven years of performance driven growth, Forager have a sustainable business but are still small and nimble enough to invest in those small listed companies not accessible to most firms.
We will stay that way. The company is majority owned by staff, and our external shareholders support our desire to place performance before revenue. That means capping the size of our funds before too much money becomes an impediment to performance.
The Forager International Shares Fund (previously the Intelligent Investor International Fund) has a very broad mandate; to invest in any listed security in the world. This means that if a security is investable, the Fund is able to own it. In practice, the Fund will predominantly invest in developed countries with stable political environments including the US, Canada, United Kingdom, Western Europe, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea.
The aim of the Fund is to provide the best risk adjusted returns available from the world’s stockmarkets.
The price you receive
The Fund is forward priced, you will receive the price struck subsequent to the receipt of your application/redemption.

Record inventories and continued supply growth has seen oil prices on a slippery slope south. We ask our panellists for their take on a highly topical investment theme.

Australian Shares Fund



Offering investors exposure to a unique portfolio of undervalued Australian shares, specialising in small, unusual opportunities that many investors miss.














This fund is listed on ASX (ASX:FOR) as a Listed Investment Trust. 
Download the Listed Investment Trust PDS, the Corporate Governance policies and the DRP Plan Information here. View information on the FOR distribution for 2017 here. 
Visit ASX (FOR) Investor Centre










The Portfolio


Our investing approach means the Australian Fund is unique in a number of ways:

By using a concentrated, selective, flexible approach we have been able to deliver superior long-term returns.
Due to our concentrated, value driven approach the returns we deliver are unlikely to be correlated with any particular index, benchmark or asset class in the short-term.
We aim to maximise the Fund’s expected return without taking needless risks. Avoiding the risk of permanent capital loss is paramount.
The fund is permitted to invest in any ASX-listed stock and hold unlisted securities (up to 10%) and as much cash as we deem appropriate. This allows us to be patient, nimble and seek value wherever it arises.
The investment mix within the portfolio can change significantly and sometimes quickly. Ask your adviser or contact us for the latest investment mix and the size of the Australian Fund.

*Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. The Trust Co (RE Services) Limited and Forager Funds Management do not guarantee investment performance or distributions, and the value of your investment may rise or fall.

Each month, the Forager Australian Shares Fund reports its performance and portfolio activity. At the end of each quarter, a more detailed Quarterly Report is published.
Prior to 30 June 2014, the Forager Australian Shares Fund was known as the Intelligent Investor Value Fund. Whilst this is the same fund and investment team, reports prior to that date use the former name.

One of the key features of the Australian Shares Fund is the low management fees (1% p.a. fees, plus up to 0.1% p.a. expense recoveries)
The Australian Shares Fund has a performance fee of 10% if the fund returns over 8% p.a. This fee is only charged on the performance amount over and above 8% p.a. All fees are accounted for in the calculation of the NAV, announced daily on ASX.

International Shares Fund



A combination of the world’s best businesses and smaller, attractively-priced opportunities, this fund offers you access to a unique portfolio of global shares.
INVEST NOW















The Portfolio


The International Shares Fund is comprised of securities listed on stock exchanges around the world. An investment in this fund offers you a combination of large blue chip companies and smaller, deep-value opportunities with the potential for higher returns.

Typically invested in 20-40 securities around the world, our International Fund provides a more concentrated portfolio than most but offers greater diversification in comparison to our Australian Shares Fund.
Predominantly focused on North American and European markets which have established legal frameworks and stable political systems; up to 20% of the International Fund can theoretically be invested in emerging markets, but to date the exposure has been minimal.
The research process is undertaken by analysts in Europe and the United States, providing local knowledge and 24-hour access to markets and companies.
The currency exposure that arises from owning foreign stocks is not hedged back to Australian dollars. This offers Australian investors potential diversification benefits through foreign currency exposure.

Establishment & withdrawal Fees






Due to the potential random impact of currency movements on any one year’s returns, we don’t believe a performance fee is suitable for this Fund. Instead, investors should be reassured by the fact that a significant portion of the staff’s own money is invested alongside theirs. This, we believe, is a genuine alignment of interests.
There is a buy spread of +0.25% and a sell spread of -0.25% on fund units which covers the cost of brokerage. The Management Fee is accounted for in the calculation of the weekly Unit Price at Friday’s close. Applications received during the week are processed the following Tuesday and redemptions are also processed weekly.
