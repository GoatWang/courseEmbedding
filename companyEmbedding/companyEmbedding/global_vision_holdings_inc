Global Vision Holdings Inc. Releases Comprehensive Development Strategies for Mamma's Best
Increasing Revenue, Spreading Product Awareness, and Gaining More Investors Is the 2015 Goal for Global Vision Holdings, Inc.
 
 

IRVINE, CA - (NewMediaWire) - March 12, 2015 - Global Vision Holdings Inc. (OTCQB: GVHIB) announces specific goals set out for its three major subsidiary companies: Mamma's Best, Grocers Direct, and Places Magazine.  
Global Vision Holdings Inc.'s Mamma's Best lives by the mantra: "look for what is next." 
Mamma's Best, the natural food division of Global Vision Holdings Inc., became one step closer in reaching grocery stores both in the Mid-West and East Coast this week. Chief Operating Officer (COO) Kaylee Duff in currently working on the official release of two additional food lines this year for Mamma's Best: organic soups, including Asian Mediterranean recipes, and Chimichurri sauces. Duff is very optimistic that these new products will bring not only a new demographic of consumers but will also increase profitability and presence throughout stores. 
In what is projected to be a $70 billion dollar industry, it is no question as to why Duff is working so critically on getting all food products sold by Global Visions Holding Inc. to be certified NON-GMO, USDA organic, and/or official-Kosher. All of Mamma's Best current and future products tailor to a rapidly growing market of health-conscious consumers and individuals with dietary restrictions. The low sugar content on all Mamma's Best products is ideal for this demographic of individuals for the simple reason that it's the healthier choice. 
Duff and her team are in the process of expanding not only to grocery stores nationwide but are also making a presence in local Farmers' Markets throughout California; this has become a new, popular grocery shopping forum in a state that has always been the forefront in putting health and food in the same category. Duff states that "[Farmers' Markets] are the future of grocery shopping and Mamma's Best is right on board." 
Duff is a huge advocate of utilizing social media to increase consumer exposure; she has been very adamant in building strategic partnerships both with food blogs and social media gurus to increase product awareness. In addition to this, Global Vision Holdings Inc. plans to increase exposure via a fleet of advertising campaign that will run throughout Southern California during the 2015-2016 year. 
Global Vision Holdings Inc.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Glen Carnes excitedly states, "Look for Mamma's Best billboards on the side of the big diesels as you are driving to work!" 
Global Vision Holdings Inc.'s other subsidiary company, Grocers Direct, assists Mamma's Best products in consistently being represented. Grocers Direct is a regional brokerage company based of Irvine, California that not only assists Global Visions Holding Inc. and its other branches, but a handful of other companies outside the company as well. Duff plans to bring in a minimum of eight new clients by the year's end. 
With the plans and actions set forth by COO Duff and CEO Carnes, Global Vision Holdings Inc. is sure to see major revenue growth in 2015. 
Stay tuned for more exciting news to follow regarding funding and financing of the operations within Global Visions Holding Inc.

The shares of common stock offered by this prospectus are being registered for 
the account of the selling stockholders named in this prospectus. We will not 
receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered through this 
prospectus by the selling stockholders. We will pay all of the expenses 
incident to the registration of the shares except for sales commissions and 
other expenses of selling stockholders.


The rapidly expanding natural and organic food industry is highly competitive. 
Many of our competitors are established market participants with national and 
international brand recognition. Our competition includes: 1) large 
conglomerates; 2) specialty brands focused on the natural and organic foods 
market; and 3) potential customers who may make sauces, marinades and other 
similar products on their own at home. Most of our competitors, particularly 
large conglomerates and private label brands with substantial market share, 
have significantly more financial resources and distribution capabilities than 
we currently do. In addition, most of our competitors have longer operating 
histories and more demonstrated brand recognition than we currently do. Some of
our specific competitors in the sauce and marinade product line include: 
Stubb’s, Organic Ville, Annie’s, Trader Joe’s brand, Soy Vay and Jim Beam. In 
the soup product line, we anticipate competing with Pacific Natural Foods, 
Imagine Natural Creations and Muir Organic, among others. And in the jam 
product line, we believe we will compete with Nature’s Hallow and others. 

We intend to compete by providing superior tasting products with all natural 
ingredients while maintaining a homemade feel. We compete primarily on the 
basis of the uniqueness our product recipes and overall product quality.  
Moreover, improving our market position, including the introduction of 
additional products, requires substantial advertising and promotional 
expenditures. However, there can be no assurance we will be able to gain enough
market share to achieve and support on-going profitability.


Company Description
One of our principal business objectives is to create shareholder value through
acquisitions or investments in environmentally responsible growth companies.   
Our investment and acquisition team specializes in proprietary fundamental 
research, used to identify and model reliable growth companies.


 We completed 
our first acquisition in March 2012 with the purchase of Mamma’s Best, a foods 
products company selling products at well-known organic and natural food retail
outlets primarily in Southern California. We anticipate that our acquisition 
efforts may result in approximately two to three acquisitions per year, though 
the actual number of acquisitions we complete remains subject to many factors, 
some of which are outside our control, and is thus uncertain. 
---

Versant International, Inc. (formerly Shang Hide Consultants, Ltd .) was 
incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 5, 2010. Initially, we were engaged
in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. Upon a change in 
management around the beginning of 2012, we increased our efforts to identify a
possible business combination. Prior to our first acquisition in March 2012 as 
further described below, we were considered a “shell company” under SEC Rule 
12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, because we had nominal assets 
consisting of cash and no or nominal operations. 

Acquisition of Mamma’s Best 

On March 12, 2012, Versant International, Inc. acquired Mamma’s Best, LLC, a 
Delaware limited liability company, through entering into a Share Exchange 
Agreement with Mamma’s Best and the selling members of Mamma’s Best. Under the 
share exchange agreement, the selling members received Ten Million (10,000,000)
shares of Class B common stock of Versant International, Inc. for 100% 
ownership of Mamma’s Best.  Mamma’s Best is a food products company. For 
accounting purposes, the share exchange transaction was treated as an 
acquisition. 

Upon the closing of the Share Exchange, the management of Mamma’s Best was 
constituted as follows: 

Name                     Title  

Glen W. Carnes           Chief Executive Officer  
Lyda  Corey              President, Chief Financial Officer  
Elizabeth Aphessetche    Chief Operating Officer, Secretary  
---

As a result of the closing of the Company’s acquisition of Mamma’s Best, our 
operations are now focused on the all-natural and organic food market. 

Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Mamma’s Best, we sell unique, all natural 
food products based on family recipes of the subsidiaries’ founders. Mamma’s 
Best was created by three sisters: Lyda, Nancy and Elizabeth, who, inspired by 
their mother’s talent for cooking, developed a unique, all natural, food 
product line based on family recipes that blended two distinct ethnic-style 
backgrounds. Through the date of this prospectus all of our sales have derived 
from a total of four sauces and marinades available at approximately 140 
natural and organic food outlets in Southern California. 
  
We are currently in the process of expanding our food line to include 
additional sauces and marinades, jams, soups, and salad dressings. We are also 
seeking to expand our geographical presence throughout the Western United 
States as well as increase the number of retailers carrying our products. 

Grocer’s Direct 

In May 2012, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Grocer’s Direct, LLC, to 
provide food branding and distribution brokerage services focused on the 
natural foods industry.  As this food brokerage arm develops, part of our 
strategy will be to facilitate efficiencies in the distribution of Mamma’s Best 
products.

Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Mamma’s Best, we sell unique, all natural 
food products based on family recipes of the subsidiaries’ founders. Mamma’s 
Best was created by three sisters: Lyda, Nancy and Elizabeth, who, inspired by 
their mother’s talent for cooking, developed a unique, all natural, food 
product line based on family recipes that blended two distinct ethnic-style 
backgrounds. Through the date of this prospectus all of our sales have derived 
from a total of four sauces and marinades available at approximately 140 
natural and organic food outlets in Southern California. 
  
We are currently in the process of expanding our food line to include 
additional sauces and marinades, jams, soups, and salad dressings. We are also 
seeking to expand our geographical presence throughout the Western United 
States as well as increase the number of retailers carrying our products. 

Grocer’s Direct 

In May 2012, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Grocer’s Direct, LLC, to 
provide food branding and distribution brokerage services focused on the 
natural foods industry.  As this food brokerage arm develops, part of our 
strategy will be to facilitate efficiencies in the distribution of Mamma’s Best 
products.
