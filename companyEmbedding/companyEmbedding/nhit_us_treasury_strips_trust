What are 'Treasury STRIPS'
 Treasury STRIPS are fixed-income securities sold at a significant discount to face value and offer no interest payments because they mature at par. STRIPS is an acronym for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities. These zero-coupon bonds come about when the bond's coupons are separated from the bond or note; an investor's return is determined by the difference between the purchase price and the bond's trading value, or face value if held to maturity.

BREAKING DOWN 'Treasury STRIPS'
Backed by the U.S. government, STRIPS, which were first introduced in 1985, offer minimal risk and some tax benefits in certain states, replacing TIGRs and CATS as the dominant zero-coupon U.S. security. Although you receive no tangible income, you typically still have to pay federal income tax on the bond's accretion for the year. All issues from the Treasury with a maturity of 10 years or longer are eligible for the STRIPS process. STRIPS cannot be purchased directly from the Federal Reserve or a governmental agency. The securities can be bought by private brokerages.Coupon StrippingThe act of detaching the interest payments is called coupon stripping. These coupons become separate securities, with the principal payment due at maturity, with no interim coupon payment.For instance, a 10-year bond with a $40,000 face value and a 5% annual interest rate can be stripped. Assuming it originally pays coupons semi-annually, 21 zero-coupon bonds can be created. This includes the 20 semi-annual coupon payments. Each stripped coupon has a $1,000 face value, which is the amount of each coupon. There is also a bond created from the principal payment at maturity. All 21 securities are distinct and trade in the market.Popularity of STRIPSThere are several reasons STRIPS have become a popular investment. They have a very high credit quality since the bonds are backed by U.S. Treasury securities. Since STRIPS are sold at a discount, investors do not need a large stash of cash to purchase the bonds. If STRIPS are held to maturity, investors know their payout.STRIPS offer a range of maturity dates since they are based on the dates of the interest payments. If an investor wishes to sell prior to maturity, the market is very liquid.Tax ConsiderationsGenerally, taxes are due for the interest earned each year, even though there is no cash payment until maturity or when the STRIPS are sold. However, a tax-deferred account, such as an  individual retirement account (IRA) and nontaxable accounts, which include   pension funds, avoid this taxation. Each holder of STRIPS receives a report detailing the amount of interest income earned.

U.S. Treasury Strips Trading
For more information on U.S. Treasury Strips, compounding interests, and zero-coupon bonds, please visit the Investment Education section of Scottrade's Knowledge Center.
To buy a U.S. Treasury Strip from your Scottrade account:

Hover over Trade at the top of your account page.
Click CDs & Bonds Overview under the Trade CDs & Bonds heading.
In the horizontal row of tabs that appears, click on the U.S. Treasury Strips tab.
Enter your search criteria in the grid provided. You may search bonds using a variety of parameters including issuer, CUSIP list, maturity dates, and coupon payments.
Once you have entered your parameters, click the Find Bonds button at the bottom right of the screen. A list of bonds meeting your desired requirements will appear.
To purchase one of the bonds that meet your criteria, click on the blue Buy button on the right side of your screen in the same row as the bond you wish to buy.
Enter the quantity you wish to purchase in the Order Qty box in the middle of the screen.
You may select the Calculate button to the bottom left of the page to retrieve the correct total. If you choose not to re-calculate at this time, the totals will automatically re-calculate once the order has been finalized.
Select the Preview Order button to the bottom right of the page. This will take you to a detailed view of your purchase.
To finalize your purchasing order, click on the Submit Order button to the bottom right of the page.

To sell a U.S. Treasury Strip in your Scottrade account:
You may sell your bonds online or through your local Scottrade branch office. If you call your local branch office for assistance selling bonds, please be ready to provide your bond's description, size and CUSIP number. Your branch broker will be able to provide you with a quote. Although U.S. Treasuries have no credit risk, the price you will receive for your bonds will depend on market conditions and may be higher or lower than the price of your original purchase. All trades are placed as market orders because the price may change between the time you are given the quote and the time the trade is actually executed. Scottrade reserves the right to act as principal on all U.S. Treasury trades made from your Scottrade account.
Bonds involve risks including, but not limited to interest rate risk, reinvestment risk, inflation risk, call risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, default risk, event risk and a risk of loss of principal. New issue offerings are sold by prospectus or offering circular available at www.scottrade.com. Investors should read these carefully. CDs may be covered by FDIC insurance while bonds may be covered by SIPC insurance. FDIC and SIPC coverage are not the same. Visit www.fdic.gov or www.sipc.org for more information.

A prospectus contains this and other information about the fund and may be obtained online or by contacting Scottrade.  The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
Leveraged and inverse ETFs may not be suitable for all investors and may increase exposure to volatility through the use of leverage, short sales of securities, derivatives and other complex investment strategies. These funds’ performance will likely be significantly different than their benchmark over periods of more than one day, and their performance over time may in fact trend opposite of their benchmark. Investors should monitor these holdings, consistent with their strategies, as frequently as daily.

The Margin Disclosure Statement and Agreement (PDF) is available for download, or it is available at one of our branch offices. It contains information on our lending policies, interest charges, and the risks associated with margin accounts.

Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Detailed information on our policies and the risks associated with options can be found in the Scottrade® Options Application and Agreement, Brokerage Account Agreement, by downloading the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options and Supplements (PDF) from The Options Clearing Corporation, or by requesting a copy by contacting Scottrade.

Keep in mind, profit will be reduced or loss worsened, as applicable, by the deduction of commissions and fees.
Market volatility, volume and system availability may impact account access and trade execution.

Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk, it does not assure a profit, or protect against loss, in a down market.

Leveraged and inverse ETFs may not be suitable for all investors and may increase exposure to volatility through the use of leverage, short sales of securities, derivatives and other complex investment strategies. These funds’ performance will likely be significantly different than their benchmark over periods of more than one day, and their performance over time may in fact trend opposite of their benchmark. Investors should monitor these holdings, consistent with their strategies, as frequently as daily.

Vanguard portfolio holdings disclaimerPortfolio holdings information:Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the percentage of the fund's total assets that each of these holdings represents as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 15 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month).Vanguard may also publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, the ten largest stock portfolio holdings of a Vanguard fund, and the aggregate percentage that these holdings represent of the fund's total net assets and equities, as of the most recent month-end, ten business days after the end of the month.Vanguard may publish on this Site, in the fund's holdings on the webpages, a detailed list of the securities (aggregated by issuer for money market funds) held in a Vanguard fund (portfolio holdings) as of the most recent calendar-quarter-end, 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter, except for Vanguard Market Neutral Fund (60 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter), Vanguard index funds (15 calendar days after the end of the month), and Vanguard Money Market Funds (within five [5 business days after the last business day of the preceding month). Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the fund.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on a delayed basis and will not necessarily represent all of the actual investments held by the relevant Vanguard fund.Portfolio holdings may exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.The following additional terms and conditions apply to the publication on this Site of any Vanguard fund's portfolio holdings as described above:By accessing the portfolio holdings, you agree not to reproduce, distribute, or disseminate the portfolio holdings, in whole or in part, in any form without prior written permission of Vanguard.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on an "as is" basis, and Vanguard makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the portfolio holdings or any financial results you may achieve from their use.In no event shall Vanguard or its affiliates have any liability relating to the use of the portfolio holdings.






StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for bond funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for bond funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.






About the optionsFund share classesA fund may offer multiple share classes. The objectives, strategies, and policies for all share classes of a fund are identical. However, expense ratios vary by share class, reflecting the differing costs of providing services to the holders of each share class.Here are some of the key distinctions:Investor SharesTraditional shares for individual investors that typically feature low minimum initial investments.Admiral™ SharesA lower-cost share class generally available without a minimum initial investment requirement to institutional investors and financial intermediary clients. Vanguard created Admiral Shares to recognize and encourage the cost savings stemming from large, long-standing investment accounts and to pass these savings on to the shareholders who generate them.Institutional SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances of $5 million or more.Institutional Plus SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances from $100 million to $200 million, depending on the fund.Institutional Select SharesShares generally available to large institutional investors. Fund account minimums range from $3 billion to $5 billion, depending on fund.ETF SharesExchange-traded shares of certain Vanguard index funds, ETF Shares combine the benefits of indexing, such as low costs and broad market diversification, with the trading and pricing flexibility of individual stocks.Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.Notes:All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

* Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). ”NR” is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include a fund’s investment in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund or Vanguard Municipal Cash Management Fund, each of which invests in high-quality money market instruments and may serve as a cash management vehicle for the Vanguard funds, trusts, and accounts. U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities appear under ”U.S. Government.” Credit-quality ratings for each issue are obtained from Barclays using ratings derived from Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard & Poor’s (S&P). When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used. When ratings are available from two of the agencies, the lower rating is used. When one rating is available, that rating is used.

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within an extremely wide range, much more than the fluctuations of the overall bond market. Although Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury ETF is listed for trading on the NYSE Arca, it is possible that an active trading market may not be maintained. Trading of Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury ETF on the NYSE Arca may be halted if NYSE Arca officials deem such action appropriate, if Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury ETF is delisted from the NYSE Arca, or if the activation of marketwide “circuit breakers ” halts stock trading generally.Interest rate risk: The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk is expected to be extremely high for the fund because it invests mainly in zero-coupon long-term bonds, which have prices that are even more sensitive to interest rate changes than are coupon-bearing bonds of similar maturity.Index sampling risk: The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.



Risk and volatility details  





Vanguard ETF Shares can be bought and sold only through a broker (who may charge a commission) and cannot be redeemed with the issuing fund. The market price of Vanguard ETF Shares may be more or less than net asset value. Investments are subject to market risk. Go to the performance page to read more about risk and volatility.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others.
