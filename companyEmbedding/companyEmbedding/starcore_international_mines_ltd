Notes

San Martin appears to have a small long life mine. This stock could do really well if they can expand production.

A lot of exploration potential.

$7 million in cash and no Debt.

3 recent acquisitions: 

American Consolidated Minerals, a project generator with properties in Nevada and Mexico. No advanced projects. They had a market cap under $1 million. 

Creston Moly, 3 copper/moly projects. El Creston moly project. Paid $2 million for a bankrupt company. El Creston at one time had a valuation of $194 million.

Gold Properties

San Martin property in Mexico on 29,000 acres. Two underground mines producing 20,000 oz. 

Reserves are low, but they have been able to maintain them with annual exploration. 

Cash costs are moderate and they have just one more year of hedging. They need to find more resources to expand production.

They have two discovery veins: Guadalupe and SAM. There is a good chance they will have exploration success and be able to expand production. 

They claim on their website that they have 3 miles of mineralization to explore.

If they can double production and gold prices go to $2,000, they should have $30 million in cash flow. 

Profitable at $1200 gold. Financially, it looks good.

New properties to explore: American Consolidated Minerals acquisition. One discover in Nevada with 175,000 oz at 1 gpt. 



Silver Properties

San Martin is a gold and silver mine, with 1 gpt silver production, although recovery is only 60% for silver (and 85% for gold),

Gold Properties

Toyiabe project in Nevada. 175,000 oz resource that is being drilled. Likely to double, and maybe more.

3,000 acre property near some very large Carlin Trend gold mines. 

Out of cash, but if they can get financing for drilling, this could be a large mine.

Drill Results
Rating History

4/22/2014: Increased rating from 1 to 2 after their share price collapsed. One drill hole from their Nevada project and this could be a 3 bagger.

Summary from New Acquisition (American Consolidated Minerals Corp.)

American Consolidated Minerals is very high risk investment. They are a project generator without an advanced project, and are out of cash. They are currently trying to do a $1 million private placement. If they are successful it will increase shares from 13 million to 43 million. The share price will drop to under 1 cent. Their current market cap is less than $1 million. 

They have been drilling a property in Nevada (Toiyabe) that is in a good location (near several very large Carlin Trend gold mines) and they have found 175,000 oz (1 gpt). Additional drilling is likely to double the resource size. However, that is not enough for a mine. The odds are not great that they will find enough resources for a mine, and even if they do, they still need to find a JV partner. Their other project is a 50% JV in Mexico (Sierra Rosario) on an early exploration silver project. They also have two other early exploration gold projects that they are not working on.

4/19/2015: Acquired by Starcore Int.

(the "Company") (SAM.TO) announces production results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, ended January 31, 2017, at its San Martin Mine ("San Martin") in Queretaro, Mexico and the Altiplano Gold Silver Processing Facility ("Altiplano") in Matehuala, Mexico.During Q3 at San Martin, a total of 69,703 tonnes were milled at an average grade of 1.90 g/t gold and 14.7 g/t silver resulting in the production of 3,237 gold equivalent ounces. Mill recoveries averaged 70.7% for gold and 47.1% for silver. Equivalent gold ounce calculation is based on the average gold:silver ratio of 70.73:1 during the quarter.In November, the mill processed carbonaceous ore for 10 days using Carbon in Leach "CIL" technology. Recovery of gold from the carbonaceous ore averaged 45% using CIL, much better than the 10% indicated by testwork using Merrill Crowe processing. After this trial, the plant was fed normal ore again for the remainder of the quarter and metal recoveries have returned to normal (80-85% for gold).Recoveries stabilized in January and testing is continuing to determine the best method to treat the carbonaceous ore. The CIL/ ADR plant worked very well from a physical perspective but there appears to be a mineralogical constituent within the ore that is hampering recovery in addition to organic carbon content.The Company has reclassified Altiplano from pre-operational phase during the last quarter and is accounting for production revenues and expenses on an operational basis, no longer capitalizing these amounts. During Q3, the Altiplano Facility received approximately 167.4 tonnes of concentrate, 5.4 tonnes of precipitates and 7.8 tonnes of slag containing approximately 915 ounces of gold and 29,000 ounces of silver. Since most of this product was received after Christmas it remains in inventory with processing continuing into February. To January 31, 2017, the Company sold 39.8 ounces of gold and 2,378.5 ounces of silver from the amounts received at Altiplano.In addition to this, Altiplano secured the purchase of approximately 3.9 tonnes of granulated carbon which was processed at the new CIL/ADR plant at the San Martin Mine in Queretaro. This carbon was processed to produce approximately 185.4 ounces of gold and 342.2 ounces of silver which was sold directly by the mine operations in Q3, but which is in addition to the mine production results reported above."It was an interesting quarter where we tested our CIL/ADR circuit. Although it had some disappointments, we are confident that we can find a cost effective solution to treat the carbonaceous ore. We were very pleased with the construction of CIL plant changeover. The plant adaptation was completed for 25% of the cost proposed by industry experts, a credit to our mine staff," stated Robert Eadie, President and CEO. "The Altiplano operations is now underway and we are working hard to find continuous and profitable sources of raw material to process in our low cost facility".David Gunning, P.Eng., a director of the Company and Chief Operating Officer, is the Company's qualified person on the project as required under NI 43-101and has prepared the technical information contained in this press release.ON BEHALF OF STARCORE INTERNATIONAL MINES LTD.Robert Eadie, President & Chief Executive OfficerThe Toronto Stock Exchange has not reviewed nor does it accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this press release.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe fear of running out of money in retirement is overblownYahoo FinanceWhy it might be ‘dangerous’ for IBM to turn itself around: professorYahoo Finance2 Dudes in a Car: Blissing out in the Lincoln ContinentalYahoo FinanceGold on track to notch weekly gain as dollar slump continuesInvesting.comAetna CEO Bertolini: How tech plays into the future of healthcareYahoo Finance VideoCall of the week: Now's the time to 'buy' ChipotleYahoo FinanceDrivers should brace for higher gas prices: AAAFox BusinessAn obscure Senate rule just put the GOP healthcare bill in even bigger perilBusiness InsiderWhat it's like to ship yourself overnight on Cabin's sleep pod busTechCrunchAetna CEO Bertolini: Why he pays his employees to sleepYahoo Finance VideoShort-sellers have lost $7.1 billion betting against this year's hottest tech stocksYahoo FinanceDivided UK, inconclusive election could put brakes on BrexitAssociated PressA former biotech executive who's living with terminal cancer wants to reset expectations about new cancer treatmentsBusiness InsiderThe CIA director just dropped some heavy hints that the US is looking into regime change in North KoreaBusiness InsiderAetna CEO Bertolini: How his own accident and son’s cancer changed his journeyYahoo Finance VideoStocks back off from record highsYahoo FinanceDonald Trump's Latest Approval Ratings Could Jeopardize His Entire PresidencyMytwocents: "He’s now officially the least popular new president in American history,"
