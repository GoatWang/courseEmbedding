FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:



Trinity Capital Corporation
Announces Agreement for Proposed $52.0 Million Equity
Recapitalization and $10.0 Million Rights Offering


 


 

Los Alamos, NM
– 09/08/2016 – Trinity Capital Corporation (the
"Company" or "Trinity"), parent company of Los Alamos National Bank
("LANB"), announced today that it has entered into a stock purchase
agreement with Castle Creek Capital Partners VI, L.P. ("Castle
Creek"), Patriot Financial Partners II, L.P., Patriot Financial
Partners Parallel II, L.P. (together with Patriot Financial
Partners II, L.P., "Patriot") and Strategic Value Bank Partners, LP
("SVP, and collectively, the "Investors"), pursuant to which it
expects to raise aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $52
million at an offering price of $4.75 per common share and $475.00
per share of a new Series C non-voting mandatorily convertible
non-cumulative preferred stock.  The securities offered will
not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
the securities laws of any state, and may not be offered or sold in
the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption
from registration requirements.

 

The Company
intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase at
par, plus all deferred dividends, 100% of the Company's outstanding
Series A and Series B preferred securities originally issued under
Treasury's Capital Purchase Program, bring current the deferred
interest on the Company's four series of trust preferred securities
("TRUPS") and for other general corporate purposes.

 

Completion of
the transactions contemplated by the agreement is contingent upon
customary closing conditions, including the respective parties
receiving regulatory approvals and non-objections, as
appropriate.

 

Each of Castle
Creek's and Patriot's investment will represent a 9.9% voting
common ownership interest and an additional ownership interest of
the Series C preferred stock described above which will convert to
shares of non-voting common stock upon the authorization of such
securities by existing shareholders.  The Company intends to
timely seek shareholder approval for the authorization of
non-voting common stock at its next annual shareholder
meeting.

 

Upon closing of
the offering and receipt of regulatory approvals, each of Castle
Creek and Patriot will be entitled to have one representative
appointed to both the Company's and LANB's board of
directors.

 

Chairman Jerry
Kindsfather said, "We are looking forward to the financial and
strategic flexibility this new capital will bring us, as well as
the additional expertise our Board of Directors will gain with the
inclusion of the Castle Creek and Patriot
representatives."








 


Company President and Chief
Executive Officer John Gulas stated, "We are encouraged that our
new investors have confidence in our turnaround efforts.  We,
and they, believe that this new capital enables us to address the
most difficult remaining challenge in restoring the Company to a
safe and sound condition."


 


The agreement permits the Company to
conduct, within one year following completion of the private
placement, a rights offering to existing shareholders of the
Company of up to $10.0 million of voting common stock.  Shares
in the rights offering will be sold at the same $4.75 purchase
price as shares of common stock sold to the Investors.  The
Investors are not entitled to participate in the rights offering
under the agreement.  Chairman Kindsfather added, "We are
grateful for our shareholders who have remained by our side as we
work to restore the health of the Company.  It was important
to us to provide our shareholders the opportunity to purchase
additional shares at the same price as the Investors."
