KKR & Co. L.P. (formerly known as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.) is an American multinational private equity firm, specializing in leveraged buyouts, headquartered in New York City. The firm sponsors and manages private equity investment funds. The firm has completed over $400 billion of private equity transactions since its inception.[3][4]
The firm was founded in 1976 by Jerome Kohlberg, Jr., and cousins Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, all of whom had previously worked together at Bear Stearns, where they completed some of the earliest leveraged buyout transactions. Since its founding, KKR has completed a number of transactions including the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, which was the largest buyout in history to that point, as well as the 2007 buyout of TXU, which is currently the largest buyout completed to date.[5][6] KKR has completed investments in over 160 companies since 1977, completing at least one investment in every year except in 1982 and in 1990.[7]
KKR has 13 additional offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.[1] The firm is currently located in the Solow Building (9 W. 57th Street), but recently announced its intentions to occupy a newly constructed 30 Hudson Yards.[8]
In October 2009, KKR listed shares in the company through KKR & Co., an affiliate that holds 30% of the firm's ownership equity, with the remainder held by the firm's partners. In March 2010, KKR filed to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),[9] with trading commencing four months later, on July 15, 2010.

The Firm KKR[edit]
KKR is operated by its managing partners Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts and a team of approximately 140 investment professionals and 400 total employees, organized into industry-focused groups.[3] KKR is headquartered in the Solow Building at 9 West 57th Street, Manhattan, New York, with U.S. offices in Menlo Park, San Francisco, Houston, and Washington, D.C., and offices in London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Beijing, Mumbai, Dubai, Seoul, São Paulo and Sydney.[1]
KKR invests primarily through leveraged buyouts as well as growth capital investments (including "PIPE" investments in public companies). It has traditionally specialized in private equity investments, focusing on specific industry sectors where the firm has created nine dedicated investment groups. The industries in which KKR has developed a specialization include:[10]

Chemicals
Consumer products
Energy & natural resources
Financial services
Health care
Industrial
Media and communications
Retail
Technology

The professionals in each of KKR's industry-focused groups are expected to have developed a proficiency in their respective industries.[10] The firm has traditionally had strong ties with its investors.[11]
Investment funds and other affiliates[edit]
Private equity funds[edit]
KKR has historically relied primarily on private equity funds, pools of committed capital that are raised from a broad array of institutional investors (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, investment banks, commercial banks, endowments, fund of funds, high-net-worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds).[3][12] As of March 31, 2014, KKR had completed fund-raising for approximately 23 traditional investment funds in the US, Europe and Asia with total committed capital of approximately US$80 billion:

Public company (NYSE: KFN)


Founded
2004


Website
www.kkrfinancial.com


KKR Financial (NYSE: KFN) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) and specialty finance company that invests in residential and commercial mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities as well as corporate loans and debt securities, asset-backed securities and equity securities. KFN was founded in 2004 raising $795 million in a private placement and raised $849 million in a June 2005 initial public offering, increasing the size of the offering from an original $600 million target.[14] KKR had initially considered structuring KFN as a business development company like Apollo Management's Apollo Investment Corporation but chose to pursue the REIT structure to capitalize on the strength in REIT valuations at the time.[14]
KFN was an early casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis and in September 2007, Henry Kravis and George Roberts injected $270 million into the company. On February 20, 2008, KFN was once again forced to delay the repayment of billions of dollars of commercial paper, and began a new round of talks with creditors.[15] In April, KFN sold a controlling interest in a real estate subsidiary to an investment firm to raise cash and entered an agreement with the noteholders of certain secured commercial paper issued by two asset-backed entities. Following the transaction, KFN converted from a REIT to a LLC.[16]
KKR Private Equity Investors[edit]






Type

Public company (Euronext: KPE)


Founded
2006


Website
www.kkrpei.com


KKR Private Equity Investors (Euronext: KPE) is a publicly traded private equity fund that invests as a fund of funds in KKR private equity funds. KPE also co-invests in transactions alongside KKR's private equity funds. KPE was founded in 2006. In May 2006, KKR raised $5 billion in an initial public offering for a KPE to serve as a new permanent investment vehicle listing it on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam. KKR raised three times more than it expected, as many of the investors in KPE were hedge funds seeking exposure to private equity but could not make long term commitments to private equity funds. As private equity had been booming in preceding years, investing in a KKR fund was attractive to investors.[17]
However, KPE's first-day performance was lackluster, trading down 1.7% and trading volume was limited.[18] Initially, a handful of other private equity firms and hedge funds had planned to follow KKR's lead but shelved those plans when KPE's performance continued to falter after its IPO. KPE's stock declined from an IPO price of €25 per share to €18.16 (a 27% decline) at the end of 2007 and a low of €11.45 (a 54.2% decline) per share in Q1 2008.[19]
KPE disclosed in May 2008 that it had completed approximately $300 million of secondary sales of selected limited partnership interests in, and undrawn commitments to, certain KKR-managed funds in order to generate liquidity and repay borrowings.[20]
In October 2009 KPE changed its name to KKR & Co. (Guernsey) L.P.,[21] which was delisted from Euronext Amsterdam in July 2010 while common units of KKR & Co. L.P. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KKR”.[22]

Founding and early history[edit]
Running the corporate finance department for Bear Stearns in the 1960s and 1970s, Jerome Kohlberg and later with protégés Henry Kravis and George Roberts completed a series of what they described as "bootstrap" investments beginning in 1964–65. They targeted family-owned businesses, many of which had been founded in the years following World War II which by the 1960s and 1970s were facing succession issues. Many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive.[4]




Henry Kravis speaking at the World Economic Forum in 2009


Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973), as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Despite a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.[23]
By 1976, tensions [clarification needed] had built up between Bear Stearns and Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts, which led to the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities. In 1976, Kravis had been required to serve as interim CEO of a failing direct mail company named Advo.[citation needed]
The new KKR completed its first buyout, that of manufacturer A.J. Industries, in 1977. KKR raised capital from a small group of investors including the Hillman Company and First Chicago Bank. By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising its first institutional fund with over $30 million of investor commitments.[24] In 1981, KKR expanded its investor base significantly when the Oregon State Treasury's public pension fund invested in KKR's acquisition of retailer Fred Meyer, Inc. Oregon State remains an active investor in KKR funds.[4]
KKR closed out the 1970s completing the public-to-private buyout of Houdaille Industries in 1979,[25] probably the largest take-private of a public company to that point. As the 1980s began, KKR was among the most prominent practitioner of leveraged buyouts and would prove the most prolific of the private equity investors in the 1980s.[4] Among the firm's most notable acquisitions during the 1980s buyout boom were the following:


Investment
Year
Company Description
Ref.


Malone & Hyde
1984
KKR completed the first buyout of a public company by tender offer, by acquiring the food distributor and supermarket operator together with the company's chairman Joseph R. Hyde III.
[26]


Wometco Enterprises
1984
KKR completed the first billion-dollar buyout transaction to acquire the leisure-time company with interests in television, movie theaters and tourist attractions. The buyout comprised the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares for $842 million and the assumption of $170 million of the company's outstanding debt.
[27]


Beatrice Companies
1985
KKR sponsored the $6.1 billion management buyout of Beatrice, which owned Samsonite and Tropicana among other consumer brands. At the time of its closing in 1985, Beatrice was the largest buyout completed.
[28][29]


Safeway
1986
KKR completed a friendly $5.5 billion buyout of Safeway to help management avoid hostile overtures from Herbert and Robert Haft of Dart Drug. Safeway was taken public again in 1990.
[30]


Jim Walter Corp.
(later Walter Industries)
1987
KKR acquired the company for $3.3 billion in early 1988 but faced issues with the buyout almost immediately. Most notably, a subsidiary of Jim Walter Corp (Celotex) faced a large asbestos lawsuit and incurred liabilities that the courts ruled would need to be satisfied by the parent company. In 1989, the holding company which KKR used for the Jim Walter buyout filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
[31][32]


Buyout of RJR Nabisco[edit]
Main article: RJR Nabisco
After the 1987 resignation of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded his own private equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm was responsible for the 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco proved to be not only the largest buyout in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign of the end of the 1980s buyout boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest buyout for the next 17 years, was chronicled in Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.[33]
In 1988, F. Ross Johnson was the President and CEO of RJR Nabisco, formed in 1985 by the merger of Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a leading producer of food products (Shredded Wheat, Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Planters peanuts, Life Savers, Del Monte Fruit and Vegetables, and Snickers Chocolate) as well as Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes. In October 1988, Johnson proposed a $17 billion ($75 per share) management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton and its parent company, American Express.[34][35]
Several days later, Kravis, who had originally suggested the idea of the buyout to Johnson, presented a new bid for $20.3 billion ($90 per share) financed with an aggressive debt package.[36][37][38] KKR had the support of significant equity co-investments from leading pension funds and other institutional investors. Investors included Coca-Cola, Georgia-Pacific and United Technologies corporate pension funds, as well as endowments from MIT, Harvard and the New York State Common Retirement Fund[12] However, KKR faced criticism from existing investors over the firm's use of hostile tactics in the buyout of RJR.[39]
KKR proposed to provide a joint offer with Johnson and Shearson Lehman but was rebuffed and Johnson attempted to stonewall KKR's access to financial information from RJR.[40][41][42][43] Rival private equity firm, Forstmann Little & Co. was invited into the process by Shearson Lehman but attempted to provide a bid for RJR with a consortium of Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Procter & Gamble, Ralston Purina and Castle & Cooke.[44]
Ultimately the Forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for RJR.[45] Many of the major banking players of the day, including Shearson Lehman Hutton, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties.

In November 1988, RJR set guidelines for a final bid submission at the end of the month.[46] The management and Shearson group submitted a final bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis and KKR. KKR's final bid of $109, while a lower dollar figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of RJR Nabisco.[47] KKR's offer was guaranteed, whereas the management offer lacked a "reset", meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated $112 per share.[48]
Additionally, many in RJR's board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of Ross Johnson' unprecedented golden parachute deal.[49][50] Time Magazine featured Ross Johnson on the cover of their December 1988 issue along with the headline, "A Game of Greed: This man could pocket $100 million from the largest corporate takeover in history. Has the buyout craze gone too far?".[51] KKR's offer was welcomed by the board, and, to some observers, it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a deal-breaker in KKR's favor was little more than an excuse to reject Ross Johnson's higher payout of $112 per share. Johnson received $53 million from the buyout.[52] KKR collected a $75 million fee in the RJR takeover.[53] At $31.1 billion of transaction value (including assumed debt), RJR Nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history.[54]
In 2006 and 2007, a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which, for the first time, surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. The deal was first surpassed in July 2006 by the $33 billion buyout of U.S. hospital operator Hospital Corporation of America, in which KKR participated, though the RJR deal was larger, adjusted for inflation. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–07 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. The RJR transaction benefited many of the parties involved. Investment bankers and lawyers who advised KKR walked away with over $1 billion in fees. Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities. Size did not, however, guarantee success as the high purchase price and debt load would burden the performance of the investment, which KKR overcame, raising a new investment fund and continuing to invest throughout the 1990s.[55]
Early 1990s: The aftermath of RJR Nabisco[edit]

The buyout of RJR Nabisco was completed in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions.[56][57][58] After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.[4]
As the new decade began, KKR began restructuring RJR. In January 1990, it completed the sale of RJR's Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt.[59] Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections and public offerings of stock to provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders. KKR's equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of RJR had been only $1.5 billion.[60][61] In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company.[62]
RJR issued additional stock to the public in March 1991 to further reduce debt, resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of RJR's debt from junk to investment grade. KKR began to reduce its ownership in RJR in 1994, when its stock in RJR was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of Borden, Inc., a producer of food and beverage products, consumer products, and industrial products, in an unprecedented and complex transaction.[63][64] [65][66] The following year, in 1995, KKR would divest itself of its final stake in RJR Nabisco when Borden sold a $638 million block of stock.[67]
While KKR no longer had any ownership of RJR Nabisco by 1995, its original investment would not be fully realized until KKR exited its last investment in 2004. After sixteen years of efforts, including contributing new equity, taking RJR public, asset sales and exchanging shares of RJR for the ownership of Borden, Inc., KKR finally sold the last remnants of its 1989 investment. In July 2004, KKR agreed to sell its stock in Borden Chemical to Apollo Management for $1.2 billion.[68]
Early 1990s: Investments[edit]
In the early 1990s, the absence of an active high yield market prompted KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR's largest investments in the 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988.[69] KKR created Primedia's predecessor, K-III Communications,[70] a platform to buy media properties, initially completing the $310 million divisional buyout of the book club division of Macmillan along with the assets of Intertec Publishing Corporation in May 1989.[71][72]
During the early 1990s, K-III continued acquiring publishing assets, including a $650 million acquisition from News Corporation in 1991.[73] K-III went public, however instead of cashing out, KKR continued to make new investments in the company in 1998, 2000 and 2001 to support acquisition activity.[74] In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR's preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the company's stock collapsed.[72]
In 1991, KKR partnered with Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in the 1991 acquisition of the Bank of New England, from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[75] In January 1996, KKR would exchange its investment for a 7.5% interest in Fleet Bank.[76] KKR completed the 1992 buyout of American Re Corporation from Aetna[77] as well as a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies and owner of Denny's in 1992.[78] Among the other notable investments KKR completed in the early 1990s included World Color Press (1993–95),[79] RELTEC Corporation (1995) and Bruno's (1995).[80]
1996–1999[edit]
By the mid-1990s, the debt markets were improving and KKR had moved on from the RJR Nabisco buyout. In 1996, KKR was able to complete the bulk of fundraising for what was then a record $6 billion private equity fund, the KKR 1996 Fund.[81] However, KKR was still burdened by the performance of the RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media.[82] KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals).[4]




KKR acquired Regal Cinemas in 1998, only to see the company in bankruptcy by 2000


KKR's activity level would accelerate over the second half of the 1990s making a series of notable investments including Spalding Holdings Corporation and Evenflo (1996),[83] Newsquest (1996),[84] KinderCare Learning Centers (1997),[85] Amphenol Corporation (1997),[86] Randalls Food Markets (1997),[87][88] The Boyds Collection (1998),[89] MedCath Corporation (1998),[90] Willis Group Holdings (1998),[91] Smiths Group (1999), and Wincor Nixdorf (1999).[92]
KKR's largest investment of the 1990s would be one of its least successful. In January 1998, KKR and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst agreed to the $1.5 billion buyout of Regal Entertainment Group.[93] KKR and Hicks Muse had initially intended to combine Regal with Act III Cinemas, which KKR had acquired in 1997 for $706 million[94] and United Artists Theaters, which Hicks Muse had agreed to acquire for $840 million in November 1997. Shortly after agreeing to the Regal takeover, the deal with United Artists fell apart, destroying the strategy to eliminate costs by building a larger combined company.[95] Two years later, in 2000, Regal encountered significant financial issues and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection; the company passed to billionaire investor Philip Anschutz.[96]
2000–2005[edit]




Shoppers Drug Mart, the Canadian pharmacy was one of several successful buyouts in the early 2000s[97]


At the start of the 21st century, the landscape of large leveraged buyout firms was changing. Several large and storied firms, including Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Forstmann Little & Company were dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble. Although, KKR's track record since RJR Nabisco was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.[4]
Additionally, KKR was one of the few firms that was able to complete large leveraged buyout transactions in the years immediately following the collapse of the Internet bubble, including Shoppers Drug Mart and Bell Canada Yellow Pages.[4][98] KKR was able to realize its investment in Shoppers Drug Mart through a 2002 IPO and subsequent public stock offerings.[97] The directories business would be taken public in 2004 as Yellow Pages Income Fund, a Canadian income trust.[99]




KKR led a consortium in the buyout of Toys "R" Us in 2004


In 2004 a consortium comprising KKR, Bain Capital and real estate development company Vornado Realty Trust announced the $6.6 billion acquisition of Toys "R" Us, the toy retailer. A month earlier, Cerberus Capital Management, made a $5.5 billion offer for both the toy and baby supplies businesses.[100] The Toys 'R' Us buyout was one of the largest in several years.[101] Following this transaction, by the end of 2004 and in 2005, major buyouts were once again becoming common and market observers were stunned by the leverage levels and financing terms obtained by financial sponsors in their buyouts.[102]
In 2005, KKR was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable given the number of firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.[103][104]
Since 2005 and the Buyout Boom[edit]
In 2006, KKR raised a new $17.6 billion fund the KKR 2006 Fund, with which the firm began executing a series of some of the largest buyouts in history. KKR's $44 billion takeover of Texas-based power utility, TXU, in 2007, proved to be the largest leveraged buyout of the mid-2000s buyout boom and the largest buyout completed to date.[105] Among the most notable companies acquired by KKR in 2006 and 2007 were the following:

HCA
2006
KKR and Bain Capital, together with Merrill Lynch and the Frist family (which had founded the company) completed a $31.6 billion acquisition of the hospital company, 17 years after it was taken private for the first time in a management buyout. At the time of its announcement, the HCA buyout would be the first of several to set new records for the largest buyout, eclipsing the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco. It would later be surpassed by the buyouts of Equity Office Properties, and TXU.
[106]


NXP Semiconductors
2006
In August 2006, a consortium of KKR, Silver Lake Partners and AlpInvest Partners acquired a controlling 80.1% share of semiconductors unit of Philips for €6.4 billion. The new company, based in the Netherlands, was renamed NXP Semiconductors.
[107]


TDC A/S
2006
The Danish phone company was acquired by KKR, Apax Partners, Providence Equity Partners and Permira for €12.2 billion ($15.3 billion), which at the time made it the second largest European buyout in history.
[108][109]


Dollar General
2007
KKR completed a buyout of the chain of discount stores operating in the U.S.
[110]


Alliance Boots
2007
KKR and Stefano Pessina, the company’s deputy chairman and largest shareholder, acquired the UK drug store retailer for £12.4 billion ($24.8 billion) including assumed debt, after increasing their bid more than 40% amidst intense competition from Terra Firma Capital Partners and Wellcome Trust. The buyout came only a year after the merger of Boots Group plc (Boots the Chemist), and Alliance UniChem plc.
[111][112]


Biomet
2007
Blackstone Group, KKR, TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs acquired the medical devices company for $11.6 billion.
[113]


First Data
2007
KKR and TPG Capital completed the $29 billion buyout of the credit and debit card payment processor and former parent of Western Union. Michael Capellas, previously the CEO of MCI Communications and Compaq was named CEO of the privately held company.
[114][115]


TXU (Energy Future Holdings)
2007
An investor group led by KKR and TPG Capital and together with Goldman Sachs completed the $44.37 billion[116] buyout of the regulated utility and power producer. The investor group had to work closely with ERCOT regulators to gain approval of the transaction but had significant experience with the regulators from their earlier buyout of Texas Genco. TXU is the largest buyout in history, and retained this distinction when the announced buyout of BCE failed to close in December 2008. The deal was notable for a drastic change in environmental policy for the energy giant, in terms of its carbon emissions from coal power plants and funding alternative energy.
[117][118]


Other non-buyout investments completed by KKR during this period included Legg Mason, Sun Microsystems, Tarkett, Longview Power Plant and Seven Network. In October 2006, KKR acquired a 50% stake in Tarkett, a France-based distributor of flooring products, in a deal valued at about €1.4 billion ($1.8 billion). On November 20, 2006, KKR announced it would form a A$4 billion partnership with the Seven Network of Australia.[119] On January 23, 2007, KKR announced it would invest $700 million through a PIPE investment in Sun Microsystems.[120] In January 2008, KKR announced it had made a $1.25 billion PIPE investment in Legg Mason through a convertible preferred stock offering.[121]
In addition to its successful buyout transactions, KKR was involved in the failed buyout of Harman International Industries (NYSE: HAR), an upscale audio equipment maker. On April 26, 2007, Harman announced it had entered an agreement to be acquired by KKR and Goldman Sachs.[122] As the financing markets became more adverse [clarification needed] in the summer of 2007, the buyout was on tenuous ground. In September 2007, KKR and Goldman backed out of the $8 billion buyout of Harman. By the end of the day, Harman's shares had plummeted by more than 24% upon the news.[123]

Initial public offering[edit]
In 2007, KKR filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission[3] to raise $1.25 billion by selling an ownership interest in its management company.[124] The filing came less than two weeks after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.[125]
The following year, in July 2008, KKR announced a new plan to list its shares. The plan called for KKR to complete a reverse takeover of its listed affiliate KKR Private Equity Investors in exchange for a 21% interest in the firm.[126] In November 2008, KKR announced a delay of this transaction until 2009. Shares of KPE had declined significantly in the second half of 2008 with the onset of the credit crunch. KKR has announced that it expects to close the transaction in 2009.[127] In October 2009, KKR listed shares in KKR & Co. on the Euronext exchange, replacing KPE and anticipates a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. The public entity represents a 30% interest in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In October 2010, KKR acquired about nine members of Goldman Sachs Group proprietary trading team after entertaining offers from investment firms such as Perella Weinberg and Blackrock. With Goldman shutting down its proprietary trading operations, its executives, led by Bob Howard, will help KKR expand beyond leveraged buyouts into areas such as hedge funds.
2010 to present day[edit]
In January 2014, KKR acquired Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc for $2.4 billion from two private equity companies - Stone Point, and Hellman & Friedman.[128]
In June 2014, KKR announced it was taking a one-third stake in a Spanish energy business of Acciona Energy, at a cost of €417 million ($567 million). The international renewable energy generation business operates renewable assets, largely wind farms, across 14 countries including the United States, Italy and South Africa.[129]
In August 2014, KKR announced it was investing $400 million to acquire Fujian Sunner Development, China's largest chicken farmer, which breeds, processes and supplies frozen and fresh chickens to consumers and corporate clients, such as KFC and McDonald's, across China.[130]
In September 2014, the firm invested $90 million in a lighting and electrics firm Savant Systems.[131]
In January 2015, KKR confirmed its purchase of British rail ticket website thetrainline.com, previously owned by Exponent. The purchase sum is unknown.[132]
On October 12, 2015, KKR announced that it has entered into definitive agreement with Allianz Capital Partners to acquire their majority stake in Selecta Group, a European vending services operator.[133]
On September 1, 2016, KKR announced that it had acquired Epicor Software Corporation, an American software company.[134]
In October 2016, it was reported that KKR invested $250 million in OVH to be used for further international expansion.[135] This funding round valued OVH at over $1 billion, making it a unicorn.
In December 2016, the Lonza Group announced it would acquire Capsugel for $5.5 billion from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.[136]
In February 2017 KKR were reported to be trying to take over the international market research company ARI GfK SE.[137] In July of the same year KKR acquired WebMD Health Corp for $2.8 billion.[138]
Notable current and former employees[edit]
Over the years, KKR has seen the departure of many of its original partners, the most notable being original co-founder Jerome Kohlberg. After a leave of absence due to an illness in 1985, Kohlberg returned to find increasing differences in strategy with his partners Kravis and Roberts.[139] In 1987, Kohlberg left KKR to found a new private equity firm Kohlberg & Company. Kohlberg & Company returned to the investment style that Kohlberg had originally practiced at Bear Stearns and in KKR's earlier years, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies.[4][140][141]
Since 1996, general partners of KKR have included Henry Kravis, George R. Roberts, Paul Raether, Robert MacDonnell, Jose Gandarillas, Michael Michelson, Saul Fox, James Greene, Michael Tokarz, Clifton Robbins, Scott Stuart, Perry Golkin and Edward Gilhuly.[142] Among those who left were Saul Fox, Ted Ammon, Ned Gilhuly, Mike Tokarz and Scott Stuart who had been instrumental in establishing KKR's reputation and track record in the 1980s.[143] KKR remains tightly controlled by Kravis and Roberts. The issue of succession has remained an important consideration for KKR's future as an ongoing institutionalized firm.

Scott C. Nuttall (born 1972), heads KKR's fastest-growing department, the Global Capital and Asset Management Group, which includes Asset Management, Capital Markets and Client and Partner Group. He joined KKR in November 1996 after leaving the Blackstone Group. His group, the firm's fastest-growing division, has $25 billion under management. With the support of co-founder George Roberts, Nuttall has largely spearheaded the campaign to expand KKR beyond its institutional investors (legacy and otherwise) into credit investment, and alternative investments, pointing out that there are billions "in revenues up for grabs".[144][145][146] He has been named Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers with Joseph Bae on July 17, 2017 to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the firm. He will concentrate on KKR's corporate and real estate credit, capital markets, hedge fund and capital raising businesses together with the firm's corporate development, balance sheet and strategic growth initiatives.[147] New York Times called him and Joseph Bae as potential successors.[148] He graduated from University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Science degree.
Joseph Bae (born circa 1972) joined KKR from Goldman Sachs in 1996. Most recently, he was the Managing Partner of KKR Asia and the Global Head of KKR's Infrastructure and Energy Real Asset businesses. Mr. Bae has been the architect of KKR's Asian expansion since 2005. He has been named Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers with Scott Nuttall on July 17, 2017 to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the firm. Mr. Bae will focus on KKR's global private equity businesses as well as the Firm's real asset platforms across energy, infrastructure and real estate private equity.[147] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard College.
Saul A. Fox left KKR in 1997 to found Fox Paine & Company, a middle market private equity firm with over $1.5 billion of capital under management[149][150]
Clifton S. Robbins left KKR to join competitor General Atlantic Partners in 2000 and later founded Blue Harbour Group,[151] a private investment firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut.[152]
Edward A. Gilhuly and Scott Stuart left KKR in 2004 to launch Sageview Capital. Prior to this, Gilhuly was the managing partner of KKR's European operations, based in London; Stuart managed KKR's energy and consumer products industry groups.[152]
Ted Ammon, started several new ventures including Big Flower Press, which printed newspaper circulars, and Chancery Lane Capital, a boutique private equity firm, before being murdered in his Long Island home October 2001. The lover of his estranged, now deceased wife, Generosa, was later convicted.[152][153][154][155]
Paul Hazen, served as chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo (1995–2001).[156] Hazen later returned to KKR to serve as chairman of Accel-KKR, a joint venture with Accel Partners and later as chairman of KKR's publicly listed affiliate, KFN.
Clive Hollick, Baron Hollick, CEO of United News and Media (1996–2005)
Ken Mehlman joined KKR in 2008 as Global Head of Public Affairs.[157]
David Petraeus, selected to serve as chairman of the newly formed KKR Global Institute (2013—present)[158]
Joseph Grundfest, Professor at Stanford Law School and youngest SEC Commissioner

KKR & Co. L.P. (formerly known as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.) is an American multinational private equity firm, specializing in leveraged buyouts, headquartered in New York City. The firm sponsors and manages private equity investment funds. The firm has completed over $400 billion of private equity transactions since its inception.[3][4]
The firm was founded in 1976 by Jerome Kohlberg, Jr., and cousins Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, all of whom had previously worked together at Bear Stearns, where they completed some of the earliest leveraged buyout transactions. Since its founding, KKR has completed a number of transactions including the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, which was the largest buyout in history to that point, as well as the 2007 buyout of TXU, which is currently the largest buyout completed to date.[5][6] KKR has completed investments in over 160 companies since 1977, completing at least one investment in every year except in 1982 and in 1990.[7]
KKR has 13 additional offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.[1] The firm is currently located in the Solow Building (9 W. 57th Street), but recently announced its intentions to occupy a newly constructed 30 Hudson Yards.[8]
In October 2009, KKR listed shares in the company through KKR & Co., an affiliate that holds 30% of the firm's ownership equity, with the remainder held by the firm's partners. In March 2010, KKR filed to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),[9] with trading commencing four months later, on July 15, 2010.

KKR has historically relied primarily on private equity funds, pools of committed capital that are raised from a broad array of institutional investors (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, investment banks, commercial banks, endowments, fund of funds, high-net-worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds).[3][12] As of March 31, 2014, KKR had completed fund-raising for approximately 23 traditional investment funds in the US, Europe and Asia with total committed capital of approximately US$80 billion:

KKR Financial (NYSE: KFN) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) and specialty finance company that invests in residential and commercial mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities as well as corporate loans and debt securities, asset-backed securities and equity securities. KFN was founded in 2004 raising $795 million in a private placement and raised $849 million in a June 2005 initial public offering, increasing the size of the offering from an original $600 million target.[14] KKR had initially considered structuring KFN as a business development company like Apollo Management's Apollo Investment Corporation but chose to pursue the REIT structure to capitalize on the strength in REIT valuations at the time.[14]
KFN was an early casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis and in September 2007, Henry Kravis and George Roberts injected $270 million into the company. On February 20, 2008, KFN was once again forced to delay the repayment of billions of dollars of commercial paper, and began a new round of talks with creditors.[15] In April, KFN sold a controlling interest in a real estate subsidiary to an investment firm to raise cash and entered an agreement with the noteholders of certain secured commercial paper issued by two asset-backed entities. Following the transaction, KFN converted from a REIT to a LLC.[16]

Public company (Euronext: KPE)

Website
www.kkrpei.com


KKR Private Equity Investors (Euronext: KPE) is a publicly traded private equity fund that invests as a fund of funds in KKR private equity funds. KPE also co-invests in transactions alongside KKR's private equity funds. KPE was founded in 2006. In May 2006, KKR raised $5 billion in an initial public offering for a KPE to serve as a new permanent investment vehicle listing it on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam. KKR raised three times more than it expected, as many of the investors in KPE were hedge funds seeking exposure to private equity but could not make long term commitments to private equity funds. As private equity had been booming in preceding years, investing in a KKR fund was attractive to investors.[17]
However, KPE's first-day performance was lackluster, trading down 1.7% and trading volume was limited.[18] Initially, a handful of other private equity firms and hedge funds had planned to follow KKR's lead but shelved those plans when KPE's performance continued to falter after its IPO. KPE's stock declined from an IPO price of €25 per share to €18.16 (a 27% decline) at the end of 2007 and a low of €11.45 (a 54.2% decline) per share in Q1 2008.[19]
KPE disclosed in May 2008 that it had completed approximately $300 million of secondary sales of selected limited partnership interests in, and undrawn commitments to, certain KKR-managed funds in order to generate liquidity and repay borrowings.[20]
In October 2009 KPE changed its name to KKR & Co. (Guernsey) L.P.,[21] which was delisted from Euronext Amsterdam in July 2010 while common units of KKR & Co. L.P. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KKR”.[22]

Founding and early history[edit]
Running the corporate finance department for Bear Stearns in the 1960s and 1970s, Jerome Kohlberg and later with protégés Henry Kravis and George Roberts completed a series of what they described as "bootstrap" investments beginning in 1964–65. They targeted family-owned businesses, many of which had been founded in the years following World War II which by the 1960s and 1970s were facing succession issues. Many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive.[4]




Henry Kravis speaking at the World Economic Forum in 2009


Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973), as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Despite a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.[23]
By 1976, tensions [clarification needed] had built up between Bear Stearns and Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts, which led to the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities. In 1976, Kravis had been required to serve as interim CEO of a failing direct mail company named Advo.[citation needed]
The new KKR completed its first buyout, that of manufacturer A.J. Industries, in 1977. KKR raised capital from a small group of investors including the Hillman Company and First Chicago Bank. By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising its first institutional fund with over $30 million of investor commitments.[24] In 1981, KKR expanded its investor base significantly when the Oregon State Treasury's public pension fund invested in KKR's acquisition of retailer Fred Meyer, Inc. Oregon State remains an active investor in KKR funds.[4]
KKR closed out the 1970s completing the public-to-private buyout of Houdaille Industries in 1979,[25] probably the largest take-private of a public company to that point. As the 1980s began, KKR was among the most prominent practitioner of leveraged buyouts and would prove the most prolific of the private equity investors in the 1980s.[4] Among the firm's most notable acquisitions during the 1980s buyout boom were the following:

KKR completed a friendly $5.5 billion buyout of Safeway to help management avoid hostile overtures from Herbert and Robert Haft of Dart Drug. Safeway was taken public again in 1990.

Jim Walter Corp.
(later Walter Industries)
1987
KKR acquired the company for $3.3 billion in early 1988 but faced issues with the buyout almost immediately. Most notably, a subsidiary of Jim Walter Corp (Celotex) faced a large asbestos lawsuit and incurred liabilities that the courts ruled would need to be satisfied by the parent company. In 1989, the holding company which KKR used for the Jim Walter buyout filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Buyout of RJR Nabisco[edit]
Main article: RJR Nabisco
After the 1987 resignation of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded his own private equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm was responsible for the 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco proved to be not only the largest buyout in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign of the end of the 1980s buyout boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest buyout for the next 17 years, was chronicled in Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.[33]
In 1988, F. Ross Johnson was the President and CEO of RJR Nabisco, formed in 1985 by the merger of Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a leading producer of food products (Shredded Wheat, Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Planters peanuts, Life Savers, Del Monte Fruit and Vegetables, and Snickers Chocolate) as well as Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes. In October 1988, Johnson proposed a $17 billion ($75 per share) management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton and its parent company, American Express.[34][35]
Several days later, Kravis, who had originally suggested the idea of the buyout to Johnson, presented a new bid for $20.3 billion ($90 per share) financed with an aggressive debt package.[36][37][38] KKR had the support of significant equity co-investments from leading pension funds and other institutional investors. Investors included Coca-Cola, Georgia-Pacific and United Technologies corporate pension funds, as well as endowments from MIT, Harvard and the New York State Common Retirement Fund[12] However, KKR faced criticism from existing investors over the firm's use of hostile tactics in the buyout of RJR.[39]
KKR proposed to provide a joint offer with Johnson and Shearson Lehman but was rebuffed and Johnson attempted to stonewall KKR's access to financial information from RJR.[40][41][42][43] Rival private equity firm, Forstmann Little & Co. was invited into the process by Shearson Lehman but attempted to provide a bid for RJR with a consortium of Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Procter & Gamble, Ralston Purina and Castle & Cooke.[44]
Ultimately the Forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for RJR.[45] Many of the major banking players of the day, including Shearson Lehman Hutton, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties.

In November 1988, RJR set guidelines for a final bid submission at the end of the month.[46] The management and Shearson group submitted a final bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis and KKR. KKR's final bid of $109, while a lower dollar figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of RJR Nabisco.[47] KKR's offer was guaranteed, whereas the management offer lacked a "reset", meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated $112 per share.[48]
Additionally, many in RJR's board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of Ross Johnson' unprecedented golden parachute deal.[49][50] Time Magazine featured Ross Johnson on the cover of their December 1988 issue along with the headline, "A Game of Greed: This man could pocket $100 million from the largest corporate takeover in history. Has the buyout craze gone too far?".[51] KKR's offer was welcomed by the board, and, to some observers, it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a deal-breaker in KKR's favor was little more than an excuse to reject Ross Johnson's higher payout of $112 per share. Johnson received $53 million from the buyout.[52] KKR collected a $75 million fee in the RJR takeover.[53] At $31.1 billion of transaction value (including assumed debt), RJR Nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history.[54]
In 2006 and 2007, a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which, for the first time, surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. The deal was first surpassed in July 2006 by the $33 billion buyout of U.S. hospital operator Hospital Corporation of America, in which KKR participated, though the RJR deal was larger, adjusted for inflation. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–07 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. The RJR transaction benefited many of the parties involved. Investment bankers and lawyers who advised KKR walked away with over $1 billion in fees. Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities. Size did not, however, guarantee success as the high purchase price and debt load would burden the performance of the investment, which KKR overcame, raising a new investment fund and continuing to invest throughout the 1990s.[55]
Early 1990s: The aftermath of RJR Nabisco[edit]




KKR's headquarters in the Solow Building at 9 West 57th Street in New York City


The buyout of RJR Nabisco was completed in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions.[56][57][58] After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.[4]
As the new decade began, KKR began restructuring RJR. In January 1990, it completed the sale of RJR's Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt.[59] Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections and public offerings of stock to provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders. KKR's equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of RJR had been only $1.5 billion.[60][61] In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company.[62]
RJR issued additional stock to the public in March 1991 to further reduce debt, resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of RJR's debt from junk to investment grade. KKR began to reduce its ownership in RJR in 1994, when its stock in RJR was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of Borden, Inc., a producer of food and beverage products, consumer products, and industrial products, in an unprecedented and complex transaction.[63][64] [65][66] The following year, in 1995, KKR would divest itself of its final stake in RJR Nabisco when Borden sold a $638 million block of stock.[67]
While KKR no longer had any ownership of RJR Nabisco by 1995, its original investment would not be fully realized until KKR exited its last investment in 2004. After sixteen years of efforts, including contributing new equity, taking RJR public, asset sales and exchanging shares of RJR for the ownership of Borden, Inc., KKR finally sold the last remnants of its 1989 investment. In July 2004, KKR agreed to sell its stock in Borden Chemical to Apollo Management for $1.2 billion.[68]
Early 1990s: Investments[edit]
In the early 1990s, the absence of an active high yield market prompted KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR's largest investments in the 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988.[69] KKR created Primedia's predecessor, K-III Communications,[70] a platform to buy media properties, initially completing the $310 million divisional buyout of the book club division of Macmillan along with the assets of Intertec Publishing Corporation in May 1989.[71][72]
During the early 1990s, K-III continued acquiring publishing assets, including a $650 million acquisition from News Corporation in 1991.[73] K-III went public, however instead of cashing out, KKR continued to make new investments in the company in 1998, 2000 and 2001 to support acquisition activity.[74] In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR's preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the company's stock collapsed.[72]
In 1991, KKR partnered with Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in the 1991 acquisition of the Bank of New England, from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[75] In January 1996, KKR would exchange its investment for a 7.5% interest in Fleet Bank.[76] KKR completed the 1992 buyout of American Re Corporation from Aetna[77] as well as a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies and owner of Denny's in 1992.[78] Among the other notable investments KKR completed in the early 1990s included World Color Press (1993–95),[79] RELTEC Corporation (1995) and Bruno's (1995).[80]
1996–1999[edit]
By the mid-1990s, the debt markets were improving and KKR had moved on from the RJR Nabisco buyout. In 1996, KKR was able to complete the bulk of fundraising for what was then a record $6 billion private equity fund, the KKR 1996 Fund.[81] However, KKR was still burdened by the performance of the RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media.[82] KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals).[4]




KKR acquired Regal Cinemas in 1998, only to see the company in bankruptcy by 2000


KKR's activity level would accelerate over the second half of the 1990s making a series of notable investments including Spalding Holdings Corporation and Evenflo (1996),[83] Newsquest (1996),[84] KinderCare Learning Centers (1997),[85] Amphenol Corporation (1997),[86] Randalls Food Markets (1997),[87][88] The Boyds Collection (1998),[89] MedCath Corporation (1998),[90] Willis Group Holdings (1998),[91] Smiths Group (1999), and Wincor Nixdorf (1999).[92]
KKR's largest investment of the 1990s would be one of its least successful. In January 1998, KKR and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst agreed to the $1.5 billion buyout of Regal Entertainment Group.[93] KKR and Hicks Muse had initially intended to combine Regal with Act III Cinemas, which KKR had acquired in 1997 for $706 million[94] and United Artists Theaters, which Hicks Muse had agreed to acquire for $840 million in November 1997. Shortly after agreeing to the Regal takeover, the deal with United Artists fell apart, destroying the strategy to eliminate costs by building a larger combined company.[95] Two years later, in 2000, Regal encountered significant financial issues and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection; the company passed to billionaire investor Philip Anschutz.[96]
2000–2005[edit]




Shoppers Drug Mart, the Canadian pharmacy was one of several successful buyouts in the early 2000s[97]


At the start of the 21st century, the landscape of large leveraged buyout firms was changing. Several large and storied firms, including Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Forstmann Little & Company were dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble. Although, KKR's track record since RJR Nabisco was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.[4]
Additionally, KKR was one of the few firms that was able to complete large leveraged buyout transactions in the years immediately following the collapse of the Internet bubble, including Shoppers Drug Mart and Bell Canada Yellow Pages.[4][98] KKR was able to realize its investment in Shoppers Drug Mart through a 2002 IPO and subsequent public stock offerings.[97] The directories business would be taken public in 2004 as Yellow Pages Income Fund, a Canadian income trust.[99]




KKR led a consortium in the buyout of Toys "R" Us in 2004


In 2004 a consortium comprising KKR, Bain Capital and real estate development company Vornado Realty Trust announced the $6.6 billion acquisition of Toys "R" Us, the toy retailer. A month earlier, Cerberus Capital Management, made a $5.5 billion offer for both the toy and baby supplies businesses.[100] The Toys 'R' Us buyout was one of the largest in several years.[101] Following this transaction, by the end of 2004 and in 2005, major buyouts were once again becoming common and market observers were stunned by the leverage levels and financing terms obtained by financial sponsors in their buyouts.[102]
In 2005, KKR was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable given the number of firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.[103][104]
Since 2005 and the Buyout Boom[edit]
In 2006, KKR raised a new $17.6 billion fund the KKR 2006 Fund, with which the firm began executing a series of some of the largest buyouts in history. KKR's $44 billion takeover of Texas-based power utility, TXU, in 2007, proved to be the largest leveraged buyout of the mid-2000s buyout boom and the largest buyout completed to date.[105] Among the most notable companies acquired by KKR in 2006 and 2007 were the following:

At the time of its announcement, the HCA buyout would be the first of several to set new records for the largest buyout, eclipsing the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco. It would later be surpassed by the buyouts of Equity Office Properties, and TXU.

TXU (Energy Future Holdings)
2007
An investor group led by KKR and TPG Capital and together with Goldman Sachs completed the $44.37 billion[116] buyout of the regulated utility and power producer. The investor group had to work closely with ERCOT regulators to gain approval of the transaction but had significant experience with the regulators from their earlier buyout of Texas Genco. TXU is the largest buyout in history, and retained this distinction when the announced buyout of BCE failed to close in December 2008. The deal was notable for a drastic change in environmental policy for the energy giant, in terms of its carbon emissions from coal power plants and funding alternative energy.
[117][118]


Other non-buyout investments completed by KKR during this period included Legg Mason, Sun Microsystems, Tarkett, Longview Power Plant and Seven Network. In October 2006, KKR acquired a 50% stake in Tarkett, a France-based distributor of flooring products, in a deal valued at about €1.4 billion ($1.8 billion). On November 20, 2006, KKR announced it would form a A$4 billion partnership with the Seven Network of Australia.[119] On January 23, 2007, KKR announced it would invest $700 million through a PIPE investment in Sun Microsystems.[120] In January 2008, KKR announced it had made a $1.25 billion PIPE investment in Legg Mason through a convertible preferred stock offering.[121]
In addition to its successful buyout transactions, KKR was involved in the failed buyout of Harman International Industries (NYSE: HAR), an upscale audio equipment maker. On April 26, 2007, Harman announced it had entered an agreement to be acquired by KKR and Goldman Sachs.[122] As the financing markets became more adverse [clarification needed] in the summer of 2007, the buyout was on tenuous ground. In September 2007, KKR and Goldman backed out of the $8 billion buyout of Harman. By the end of the day, Harman's shares had plummeted by more than 24% upon the news.[123]

Initial public offering[edit]
In 2007, KKR filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission[3] to raise $1.25 billion by selling an ownership interest in its management company.[124] The filing came less than two weeks after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.[125]
The following year, in July 2008, KKR announced a new plan to list its shares. The plan called for KKR to complete a reverse takeover of its listed affiliate KKR Private Equity Investors in exchange for a 21% interest in the firm.[126] In November 2008, KKR announced a delay of this transaction until 2009. Shares of KPE had declined significantly in the second half of 2008 with the onset of the credit crunch. KKR has announced that it expects to close the transaction in 2009.[127] In October 2009, KKR listed shares in KKR & Co. on the Euronext exchange, replacing KPE and anticipates a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. The public entity represents a 30% interest in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In October 2010, KKR acquired about nine members of Goldman Sachs Group proprietary trading team after entertaining offers from investment firms such as Perella Weinberg and Blackrock. With Goldman shutting down its proprietary trading operations, its executives, led by Bob Howard, will help KKR expand beyond leveraged buyouts into areas such as hedge funds.

In January 2014, KKR acquired Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc for $2.4 billion from two private equity companies - Stone Point, and Hellman & Friedman.[128]
In June 2014, KKR announced it was taking a one-third stake in a Spanish energy business of Acciona Energy, at a cost of €417 million ($567 million). The international renewable energy generation business operates renewable assets, largely wind farms, across 14 countries including the United States, Italy and South Africa.[129]
In August 2014, KKR announced it was investing $400 million to acquire Fujian Sunner Development, China's largest chicken farmer, which breeds, processes and supplies frozen and fresh chickens to consumers and corporate clients, such as KFC and McDonald's, across China.[130]
In September 2014, the firm invested $90 million in a lighting and electrics firm Savant Systems.[131]
In January 2015, KKR confirmed its purchase of British rail ticket website thetrainline.com, previously owned by Exponent. The purchase sum is unknown.[132]
On October 12, 2015, KKR announced that it has entered into definitive agreement with Allianz Capital Partners to acquire their majority stake in Selecta Group, a European vending services operator.[133]
On September 1, 2016, KKR announced that it had acquired Epicor Software Corporation, an American software company.[134]
In October 2016, it was reported that KKR invested $250 million in OVH to be used for further international expansion.[135] This funding round valued OVH at over $1 billion, making it a unicorn.
In December 2016, the Lonza Group announced it would acquire Capsugel for $5.5 billion from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.[136]
In February 2017 KKR were reported to be trying to take over the international market research company ARI GfK SE.[137] In July of the same year KKR acquired WebMD Health Corp for $2.8 billion.[138]
Notable current and former employees[edit]
Over the years, KKR has seen the departure of many of its original partners, the most notable being original co-founder Jerome Kohlberg. After a leave of absence due to an illness in 1985, Kohlberg returned to find increasing differences in strategy with his partners Kravis and Roberts.[139] In 1987, Kohlberg left KKR to found a new private equity firm Kohlberg & Company. Kohlberg & Company returned to the investment style that Kohlberg had originally practiced at Bear Stearns and in KKR's earlier years, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies.[4][140][141]
Since 1996, general partners of KKR have included Henry Kravis, George R. Roberts, Paul Raether, Robert MacDonnell, Jose Gandarillas, Michael Michelson, Saul Fox, James Greene, Michael Tokarz, Clifton Robbins, Scott Stuart, Perry Golkin and Edward Gilhuly.[142] Among those who left were Saul Fox, Ted Ammon, Ned Gilhuly, Mike Tokarz and Scott Stuart who had been instrumental in establishing KKR's reputation and track record in the 1980s.[143] KKR remains tightly controlled by Kravis and Roberts. The issue of succession has remained an important consideration for KKR's future as an ongoing institutionalized firm.

Scott C. Nuttall (born 1972), heads KKR's fastest-growing department, the Global Capital and Asset Management Group, which includes Asset Management, Capital Markets and Client and Partner Group. He joined KKR in November 1996 after leaving the Blackstone Group. His group, the firm's fastest-growing division, has $25 billion under management. With the support of co-founder George Roberts, Nuttall has largely spearheaded the campaign to expand KKR beyond its institutional investors (legacy and otherwise) into credit investment, and alternative investments, pointing out that there are billions "in revenues up for grabs".[144][145][146] He has been named Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers with Joseph Bae on July 17, 2017 to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the firm. He will concentrate on KKR's corporate and real estate credit, capital markets, hedge fund and capital raising businesses together with the firm's corporate development, balance sheet and strategic growth initiatives.[147] New York Times called him and Joseph Bae as potential successors.[148] He graduated from University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Science degree.
Joseph Bae (born circa 1972) joined KKR from Goldman Sachs in 1996. Most recently, he was the Managing Partner of KKR Asia and the Global Head of KKR's Infrastructure and Energy Real Asset businesses. Mr. Bae has been the architect of KKR's Asian expansion since 2005. He has been named Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers with Scott Nuttall on July 17, 2017 to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the firm. Mr. Bae will focus on KKR's global private equity businesses as well as the Firm's real asset platforms across energy, infrastructure and real estate private equity.[147] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard College.
Saul A. Fox left KKR in 1997 to found Fox Paine & Company, a middle market private equity firm with over $1.5 billion of capital under management[149][150]
Clifton S. Robbins left KKR to join competitor General Atlantic Partners in 2000 and later founded Blue Harbour Group,[151] a private investment firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut.[152]
Edward A. Gilhuly and Scott Stuart left KKR in 2004 to launch Sageview Capital. Prior to this, Gilhuly was the managing partner of KKR's European operations, based in London; Stuart managed KKR's energy and consumer products industry groups.[152]
Ted Ammon, started several new ventures including Big Flower Press, which printed newspaper circulars, and Chancery Lane Capital, a boutique private equity firm, before being murdered in his Long Island home October 2001. The lover of his estranged, now deceased wife, Generosa, was later convicted.[152][153][154][155]
Paul Hazen, served as chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo (1995–2001).[156] Hazen later returned to KKR to serve as chairman of Accel-KKR, a joint venture with Accel Partners and later as chairman of KKR's publicly listed affiliate, KFN.
Clive Hollick, Baron Hollick, CEO of United News and Media (1996–2005)
Ken Mehlman joined KKR in 2008 as Global Head of Public Affairs.[157]
David Petraeus, selected to serve as chairman of the newly formed KKR Global Institute (2013—present)[158]
Joseph Grundfest, Professor at Stanford Law School and youngest SEC Commissioner

KKR & Co. L.P. (formerly known as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.) is an American multinational private equity firm, specializing in leveraged buyouts, headquartered in New York City. The firm sponsors and manages private equity investment funds. The firm has completed over $400 billion of private equity transactions since its inception.[3][4]
The firm was founded in 1976 by Jerome Kohlberg, Jr., and cousins Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, all of whom had previously worked together at Bear Stearns, where they completed some of the earliest leveraged buyout transactions. Since its founding, KKR has completed a number of transactions including the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, which was the largest buyout in history to that point, as well as the 2007 buyout of TXU, which is currently the largest buyout completed to date.[5][6] KKR has completed investments in over 160 companies since 1977, completing at least one investment in every year except in 1982 and in 1990.[7]
KKR has 13 additional offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.[1] The firm is currently located in the Solow Building (9 W. 57th Street), but recently announced its intentions to occupy a newly constructed 30 Hudson Yards.[8]
In October 2009, KKR listed shares in the company through KKR & Co., an affiliate that holds 30% of the firm's ownership equity, with the remainder held by the firm's partners. In March 2010, KKR filed to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),[9] with trading commencing four months later, on July 15, 2010.

Investment funds and other affiliates[edit]
Private equity funds[edit]
KKR has historically relied primarily on private equity funds, pools of committed capital that are raised from a broad array of institutional investors (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, investment banks, commercial banks, endowments, fund of funds, high-net-worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds).[3][12] As of March 31, 2014, KKR had completed fund-raising for approximately 23 traditional investment funds in the US, Europe and Asia with total committed capital of approximately US$80 billion:

Public company (NYSE: KFN)


Founded

KKR Financial (NYSE: KFN) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) and specialty finance company that invests in residential and commercial mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities as well as corporate loans and debt securities, asset-backed securities and equity securities. KFN was founded in 2004 raising $795 million in a private placement and raised $849 million in a June 2005 initial public offering, increasing the size of the offering from an original $600 million target.[14] KKR had initially considered structuring KFN as a business development company like Apollo Management's Apollo Investment Corporation but chose to pursue the REIT structure to capitalize on the strength in REIT valuations at the time.[14]
KFN was an early casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis and in September 2007, Henry Kravis and George Roberts injected $270 million into the company. On February 20, 2008, KFN was once again forced to delay the repayment of billions of dollars of commercial paper, and began a new round of talks with creditors.[15] In April, KFN sold a controlling interest in a real estate subsidiary to an investment firm to raise cash and entered an agreement with the noteholders of certain secured commercial paper issued by two asset-backed entities. Following the transaction, KFN converted from a REIT to a LLC.[16]
KKR Private Equity Investors[edit]

Public company (Euronext: KPE)


Founded
2006


Website
www.kkrpei.com


KKR Private Equity Investors (Euronext: KPE) is a publicly traded private equity fund that invests as a fund of funds in KKR private equity funds. KPE also co-invests in transactions alongside KKR's private equity funds. KPE was founded in 2006. In May 2006, KKR raised $5 billion in an initial public offering for a KPE to serve as a new permanent investment vehicle listing it on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam. KKR raised three times more than it expected, as many of the investors in KPE were hedge funds seeking exposure to private equity but could not make long term commitments to private equity funds. As private equity had been booming in preceding years, investing in a KKR fund was attractive to investors.[17]
However, KPE's first-day performance was lackluster, trading down 1.7% and trading volume was limited.[18] Initially, a handful of other private equity firms and hedge funds had planned to follow KKR's lead but shelved those plans when KPE's performance continued to falter after its IPO. KPE's stock declined from an IPO price of €25 per share to €18.16 (a 27% decline) at the end of 2007 and a low of €11.45 (a 54.2% decline) per share in Q1 2008.[19]
KPE disclosed in May 2008 that it had completed approximately $300 million of secondary sales of selected limited partnership interests in, and undrawn commitments to, certain KKR-managed funds in order to generate liquidity and repay borrowings.[20]
In October 2009 KPE changed its name to KKR & Co. (Guernsey) L.P.,[21] which was delisted from Euronext Amsterdam in July 2010 while common units of KKR & Co. L.P. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KKR”.[22]

Founding and early history[edit]
Running the corporate finance department for Bear Stearns in the 1960s and 1970s, Jerome Kohlberg and later with protégés Henry Kravis and George Roberts completed a series of what they described as "bootstrap" investments beginning in 1964–65. They targeted family-owned businesses, many of which had been founded in the years following World War II which by the 1960s and 1970s were facing succession issues. Many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive.[4]




Henry Kravis speaking at the World Economic Forum in 2009


Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973), as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Despite a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.[23]
By 1976, tensions [clarification needed] had built up between Bear Stearns and Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts, which led to the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities. In 1976, Kravis had been required to serve as interim CEO of a failing direct mail company named Advo.[citation needed]
The new KKR completed its first buyout, that of manufacturer A.J. Industries, in 1977. KKR raised capital from a small group of investors including the Hillman Company and First Chicago Bank. By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising its first institutional fund with over $30 million of investor commitments.[24] In 1981, KKR expanded its investor base significantly when the Oregon State Treasury's public pension fund invested in KKR's acquisition of retailer Fred Meyer, Inc. Oregon State remains an active investor in KKR funds.[4]
KKR closed out the 1970s completing the public-to-private buyout of Houdaille Industries in 1979,[25] probably the largest take-private of a public company to that point. As the 1980s began, KKR was among the most prominent practitioner of leveraged buyouts and would prove the most prolific of the private equity investors in the 1980s.[4] Among the firm's most notable acquisitions during the 1980s buyout boom were the following:

Malone & Hyde
1984
KKR completed the first buyout of a public company by tender offer, by acquiring the food distributor and supermarket operator together with the company's chairman Joseph R. Hyde III.

Wometco Enterprises
1984
KKR completed the first billion-dollar buyout transaction to acquire the leisure-time company with interests in television, movie theaters and tourist attractions. The buyout comprised the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares for $842 million and the assumption of $170 million of the company's outstanding debt.
[27]


Beatrice Companies
1985
KKR sponsored the $6.1 billion management buyout of Beatrice, which owned Samsonite and Tropicana among other consumer brands. At the time of its closing in 1985, Beatrice was the largest buyout completed.
[28][29]


Safeway
1986
KKR completed a friendly $5.5 billion buyout of Safeway to help management avoid hostile overtures from Herbert and Robert Haft of Dart Drug. Safeway was taken public again in 1990.
[30]


Jim Walter Corp.
(later Walter Industries)
1987
KKR acquired the company for $3.3 billion in early 1988 but faced issues with the buyout almost immediately. Most notably, a subsidiary of Jim Walter Corp (Celotex) faced a large asbestos lawsuit and incurred liabilities that the courts ruled would need to be satisfied by the parent company. In 1989, the holding company which KKR used for the Jim Walter buyout filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
[31][32]


Buyout of RJR Nabisco[edit]
Main article: RJR Nabisco
After the 1987 resignation of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded his own private equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm was responsible for the 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco proved to be not only the largest buyout in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign of the end of the 1980s buyout boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest buyout for the next 17 years, was chronicled in Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.[33]
In 1988, F. Ross Johnson was the President and CEO of RJR Nabisco, formed in 1985 by the merger of Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a leading producer of food products (Shredded Wheat, Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Planters peanuts, Life Savers, Del Monte Fruit and Vegetables, and Snickers Chocolate) as well as Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes. In October 1988, Johnson proposed a $17 billion ($75 per share) management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton and its parent company, American Express.[34][35]
Several days later, Kravis, who had originally suggested the idea of the buyout to Johnson, presented a new bid for $20.3 billion ($90 per share) financed with an aggressive debt package.[36][37][38] KKR had the support of significant equity co-investments from leading pension funds and other institutional investors. Investors included Coca-Cola, Georgia-Pacific and United Technologies corporate pension funds, as well as endowments from MIT, Harvard and the New York State Common Retirement Fund[12] However, KKR faced criticism from existing investors over the firm's use of hostile tactics in the buyout of RJR.[39]
KKR proposed to provide a joint offer with Johnson and Shearson Lehman but was rebuffed and Johnson attempted to stonewall KKR's access to financial information from RJR.[40][41][42][43] Rival private equity firm, Forstmann Little & Co. was invited into the process by Shearson Lehman but attempted to provide a bid for RJR with a consortium of Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Procter & Gamble, Ralston Purina and Castle & Cooke.[44]
Ultimately the Forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for RJR.[45] Many of the major banking players of the day, including Shearson Lehman Hutton, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties.

In November 1988, RJR set guidelines for a final bid submission at the end of the month.[46] The management and Shearson group submitted a final bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis and KKR. KKR's final bid of $109, while a lower dollar figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of RJR Nabisco.[47] KKR's offer was guaranteed, whereas the management offer lacked a "reset", meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated $112 per share.[48]
Additionally, many in RJR's board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of Ross Johnson' unprecedented golden parachute deal.[49][50] Time Magazine featured Ross Johnson on the cover of their December 1988 issue along with the headline, "A Game of Greed: This man could pocket $100 million from the largest corporate takeover in history. Has the buyout craze gone too far?".[51] KKR's offer was welcomed by the board, and, to some observers, it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a deal-breaker in KKR's favor was little more than an excuse to reject Ross Johnson's higher payout of $112 per share. Johnson received $53 million from the buyout.[52] KKR collected a $75 million fee in the RJR takeover.[53] At $31.1 billion of transaction value (including assumed debt), RJR Nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history.[54]
In 2006 and 2007, a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which, for the first time, surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. The deal was first surpassed in July 2006 by the $33 billion buyout of U.S. hospital operator Hospital Corporation of America, in which KKR participated, though the RJR deal was larger, adjusted for inflation. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–07 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. The RJR transaction benefited many of the parties involved. Investment bankers and lawyers who advised KKR walked away with over $1 billion in fees. Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities. Size did not, however, guarantee success as the high purchase price and debt load would burden the performance of the investment, which KKR overcame, raising a new investment fund and continuing to invest throughout the 1990s.[55]
Early 1990s: The aftermath of RJR Nabisco[edit]




KKR's headquarters in the Solow Building at 9 West 57th Street in New York City


The buyout of RJR Nabisco was completed in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions.[56][57][58] After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.[4]
As the new decade began, KKR began restructuring RJR. In January 1990, it completed the sale of RJR's Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt.[59] Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections and public offerings of stock to provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders. KKR's equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of RJR had been only $1.5 billion.[60][61] In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company.[62]
RJR issued additional stock to the public in March 1991 to further reduce debt, resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of RJR's debt from junk to investment grade. KKR began to reduce its ownership in RJR in 1994, when its stock in RJR was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of Borden, Inc., a producer of food and beverage products, consumer products, and industrial products, in an unprecedented and complex transaction.[63][64] [65][66] The following year, in 1995, KKR would divest itself of its final stake in RJR Nabisco when Borden sold a $638 million block of stock.[67]
While KKR no longer had any ownership of RJR Nabisco by 1995, its original investment would not be fully realized until KKR exited its last investment in 2004. After sixteen years of efforts, including contributing new equity, taking RJR public, asset sales and exchanging shares of RJR for the ownership of Borden, Inc., KKR finally sold the last remnants of its 1989 investment. In July 2004, KKR agreed to sell its stock in Borden Chemical to Apollo Management for $1.2 billion.[68]
Early 1990s: Investments[edit]
In the early 1990s, the absence of an active high yield market prompted KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR's largest investments in the 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988.[69] KKR created Primedia's predecessor, K-III Communications,[70] a platform to buy media properties, initially completing the $310 million divisional buyout of the book club division of Macmillan along with the assets of Intertec Publishing Corporation in May 1989.[71][72]
During the early 1990s, K-III continued acquiring publishing assets, including a $650 million acquisition from News Corporation in 1991.[73] K-III went public, however instead of cashing out, KKR continued to make new investments in the company in 1998, 2000 and 2001 to support acquisition activity.[74] In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR's preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the company's stock collapsed.[72]
In 1991, KKR partnered with Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in the 1991 acquisition of the Bank of New England, from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[75] In January 1996, KKR would exchange its investment for a 7.5% interest in Fleet Bank.[76] KKR completed the 1992 buyout of American Re Corporation from Aetna[77] as well as a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies and owner of Denny's in 1992.[78] Among the other notable investments KKR completed in the early 1990s included World Color Press (1993–95),[79] RELTEC Corporation (1995) and Bruno's (1995).[80]
1996–1999[edit]
By the mid-1990s, the debt markets were improving and KKR had moved on from the RJR Nabisco buyout. In 1996, KKR was able to complete the bulk of fundraising for what was then a record $6 billion private equity fund, the KKR 1996 Fund.[81] However, KKR was still burdened by the performance of the RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media.[82] KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals).[4]

KKR's activity level would accelerate over the second half of the 1990s making a series of notable investments including Spalding Holdings Corporation and Evenflo (1996),[83] Newsquest (1996),[84] KinderCare Learning Centers (1997),[85] Amphenol Corporation (1997),[86] Randalls Food Markets (1997),[87][88] The Boyds Collection (1998),[89] MedCath Corporation (1998),[90] Willis Group Holdings (1998),[91] Smiths Group (1999), and Wincor Nixdorf (1999).[92]
KKR's largest investment of the 1990s would be one of its least successful. In January 1998, KKR and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst agreed to the $1.5 billion buyout of Regal Entertainment Group.[93] KKR and Hicks Muse had initially intended to combine Regal with Act III Cinemas, which KKR had acquired in 1997 for $706 million[94] and United Artists Theaters, which Hicks Muse had agreed to acquire for $840 million in November 1997. Shortly after agreeing to the Regal takeover, the deal with United Artists fell apart, destroying the strategy to eliminate costs by building a larger combined company.[95] Two years later, in 2000, Regal encountered significant financial issues and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection; the company passed to billionaire investor Philip Anschutz.[96]
2000–2005[edit]




Shoppers Drug Mart, the Canadian pharmacy was one of several successful buyouts in the early 2000s[97]


At the start of the 21st century, the landscape of large leveraged buyout firms was changing. Several large and storied firms, including Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Forstmann Little & Company were dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble. Although, KKR's track record since RJR Nabisco was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.[4]
Additionally, KKR was one of the few firms that was able to complete large leveraged buyout transactions in the years immediately following the collapse of the Internet bubble, including Shoppers Drug Mart and Bell Canada Yellow Pages.[4][98] KKR was able to realize its investment in Shoppers Drug Mart through a 2002 IPO and subsequent public stock offerings.[97] The directories business would be taken public in 2004 as Yellow Pages Income Fund, a Canadian income trust.[99]




KKR led a consortium in the buyout of Toys "R" Us in 2004


In 2004 a consortium comprising KKR, Bain Capital and real estate development company Vornado Realty Trust announced the $6.6 billion acquisition of Toys "R" Us, the toy retailer. A month earlier, Cerberus Capital Management, made a $5.5 billion offer for both the toy and baby supplies businesses.[100] The Toys 'R' Us buyout was one of the largest in several years.[101] Following this transaction, by the end of 2004 and in 2005, major buyouts were once again becoming common and market observers were stunned by the leverage levels and financing terms obtained by financial sponsors in their buyouts.[102]
In 2005, KKR was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable given the number of firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.[103][104]
Since 2005 and the Buyout Boom[edit]
In 2006, KKR raised a new $17.6 billion fund the KKR 2006 Fund, with which the firm began executing a series of some of the largest buyouts in history. KKR's $44 billion takeover of Texas-based power utility, TXU, in 2007, proved to be the largest leveraged buyout of the mid-2000s buyout boom and the largest buyout completed to date.[105] Among the most notable companies acquired by KKR in 2006 and 2007 were the following:

HCA
2006
KKR and Bain Capital, together with Merrill Lynch and the Frist family (which had founded the company) completed a $31.6 billion acquisition of the hospital company, 17 years after it was taken private for the first time in a management buyout. At the time of its announcement, the HCA buyout would be the first of several to set new records for the largest buyout, eclipsing the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco. It would later be surpassed by the buyouts of Equity Office Properties, and TXU.
[106]


NXP Semiconductors
2006
In August 2006, a consortium of KKR, Silver Lake Partners and AlpInvest Partners acquired a controlling 80.1% share of semiconductors unit of Philips for €6.4 billion. The new company, based in the Netherlands, was renamed NXP Semiconductors.
[107]


TDC A/S
2006
The Danish phone company was acquired by KKR, Apax Partners, Providence Equity Partners and Permira for €12.2 billion ($15.3 billion), which at the time made it the second largest European buyout in history.
[108][109]


Dollar General
2007
KKR completed a buyout of the chain of discount stores operating in the U.S.
[110]


Alliance Boots
2007
KKR and Stefano Pessina, the company’s deputy chairman and largest shareholder, acquired the UK drug store retailer for £12.4 billion ($24.8 billion) including assumed debt, after increasing their bid more than 40% amidst intense competition from Terra Firma Capital Partners and Wellcome Trust. The buyout came only a year after the merger of Boots Group plc (Boots the Chemist), and Alliance UniChem plc.
[111][112]


Biomet
2007
Blackstone Group, KKR, TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs acquired the medical devices company for $11.6 billion.
[113]


First Data
2007
KKR and TPG Capital completed the $29 billion buyout of the credit and debit card payment processor and former parent of Western Union. Michael Capellas, previously the CEO of MCI Communications and Compaq was named CEO of the privately held company.
[114][115]


TXU (Energy Future Holdings)
2007
An investor group led by KKR and TPG Capital and together with Goldman Sachs completed the $44.37 billion[116] buyout of the regulated utility and power producer. The investor group had to work closely with ERCOT regulators to gain approval of the transaction but had significant experience with the regulators from their earlier buyout of Texas Genco. TXU is the largest buyout in history, and retained this distinction when the announced buyout of BCE failed to close in December 2008. The deal was notable for a drastic change in environmental policy for the energy giant, in terms of its carbon emissions from coal power plants and funding alternative energy.
[117][118]


Other non-buyout investments completed by KKR during this period included Legg Mason, Sun Microsystems, Tarkett, Longview Power Plant and Seven Network. In October 2006, KKR acquired a 50% stake in Tarkett, a France-based distributor of flooring products, in a deal valued at about €1.4 billion ($1.8 billion). On November 20, 2006, KKR announced it would form a A$4 billion partnership with the Seven Network of Australia.[119] On January 23, 2007, KKR announced it would invest $700 million through a PIPE investment in Sun Microsystems.[120] In January 2008, KKR announced it had made a $1.25 billion PIPE investment in Legg Mason through a convertible preferred stock offering.[121]
In addition to its successful buyout transactions, KKR was involved in the failed buyout of Harman International Industries (NYSE: HAR), an upscale audio equipment maker. On April 26, 2007, Harman announced it had entered an agreement to be acquired by KKR and Goldman Sachs.[122] As the financing markets became more adverse [clarification needed] in the summer of 2007, the buyout was on tenuous ground. In September 2007, KKR and Goldman backed out of the $8 billion buyout of Harman. By the end of the day, Harman's shares had plummeted by more than 24% upon the news.[123]

Initial public offering[edit]
In 2007, KKR filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission[3] to raise $1.25 billion by selling an ownership interest in its management company.[124] The filing came less than two weeks after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.[125]
The following year, in July 2008, KKR announced a new plan to list its shares. The plan called for KKR to complete a reverse takeover of its listed affiliate KKR Private Equity Investors in exchange for a 21% interest in the firm.[126] In November 2008, KKR announced a delay of this transaction until 2009. Shares of KPE had declined significantly in the second half of 2008 with the onset of the credit crunch. KKR has announced that it expects to close the transaction in 2009.[127] In October 2009, KKR listed shares in KKR & Co. on the Euronext exchange, replacing KPE and anticipates a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. The public entity represents a 30% interest in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In October 2010, KKR acquired about nine members of Goldman Sachs Group proprietary trading team after entertaining offers from investment firms such as Perella Weinberg and Blackrock. With Goldman shutting down its proprietary trading operations, its executives, led by Bob Howard, will help KKR expand beyond leveraged buyouts into areas such as hedge funds.
2010 to present day[edit]
In January 2014, KKR acquired Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc for $2.4 billion from two private equity companies - Stone Point, and Hellman & Friedman.[128]
In June 2014, KKR announced it was taking a one-third stake in a Spanish energy business of Acciona Energy, at a cost of €417 million ($567 million). The international renewable energy generation business operates renewable assets, largely wind farms, across 14 countries including the United States, Italy and South Africa.[129]
In August 2014, KKR announced it was investing $400 million to acquire Fujian Sunner Development, China's largest chicken farmer, which breeds, processes and supplies frozen and fresh chickens to consumers and corporate clients, such as KFC and McDonald's, across China.[130]
In September 2014, the firm invested $90 million in a lighting and electrics firm Savant Systems.[131]
In January 2015, KKR confirmed its purchase of British rail ticket website thetrainline.com, previously owned by Exponent. The purchase sum is unknown.[132]
On October 12, 2015, KKR announced that it has entered into definitive agreement with Allianz Capital Partners to acquire their majority stake in Selecta Group, a European vending services operator.[133]
On September 1, 2016, KKR announced that it had acquired Epicor Software Corporation, an American software company.[134]
In October 2016, it was reported that KKR invested $250 million in OVH to be used for further international expansion.[135] This funding round valued OVH at over $1 billion, making it a unicorn.
In December 2016, the Lonza Group announced it would acquire Capsugel for $5.5 billion from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.[136]
In February 2017 KKR were reported to be trying to take over the international market research company ARI GfK SE.[137] In July of the same year KKR acquired WebMD Health Corp for $2.8 billion.[138]
Notable current and former employees[edit]
Over the years, KKR has seen the departure of many of its original partners, the most notable being original co-founder Jerome Kohlberg. After a leave of absence due to an illness in 1985, Kohlberg returned to find increasing differences in strategy with his partners Kravis and Roberts.[139] In 1987, Kohlberg left KKR to found a new private equity firm Kohlberg & Company. Kohlberg & Company returned to the investment style that Kohlberg had originally practiced at Bear Stearns and in KKR's earlier years, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies.[4][140][141]
Since 1996, general partners of KKR have included Henry Kravis, George R. Roberts, Paul Raether, Robert MacDonnell, Jose Gandarillas, Michael Michelson, Saul Fox, James Greene, Michael Tokarz, Clifton Robbins, Scott Stuart, Perry Golkin and Edward Gilhuly.[142] Among those who left were Saul Fox, Ted Ammon, Ned Gilhuly, Mike Tokarz and Scott Stuart who had been instrumental in establishing KKR's reputation and track record in the 1980s.[143] KKR remains tightly controlled by Kravis and Roberts. The issue of succession has remained an important consideration for KKR's future as an ongoing institutionalized firm.

Scott C. Nuttall (born 1972), heads KKR's fastest-growing department, the Global Capital and Asset Management Group, which includes Asset Management, Capital Markets and Client and Partner Group. He joined KKR in November 1996 after leaving the Blackstone Group. His group, the firm's fastest-growing division, has $25 billion under management. With the support of co-founder George Roberts, Nuttall has largely spearheaded the campaign to expand KKR beyond its institutional investors (legacy and otherwise) into credit investment, and alternative investments, pointing out that there are billions "in revenues up for grabs".[144][145][146] He has been named Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers with Joseph Bae on July 17, 2017 to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the firm. He will concentrate on KKR's corporate and real estate credit, capital markets, hedge fund and capital raising businesses together with the firm's corporate development, balance sheet and strategic growth initiatives.[147] New York Times called him and Joseph Bae as potential successors.[148] He graduated from University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Science degree.
Joseph Bae (born circa 1972) joined KKR from Goldman Sachs in 1996. Most recently, he was the Managing Partner of KKR Asia and the Global Head of KKR's Infrastructure and Energy Real Asset businesses. Mr. Bae has been the architect of KKR's Asian expansion since 2005. He has been named Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers with Scott Nuttall on July 17, 2017 to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the firm. Mr. Bae will focus on KKR's global private equity businesses as well as the Firm's real asset platforms across energy, infrastructure and real estate private equity.[147] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard College.
Saul A. Fox left KKR in 1997 to found Fox Paine & Company, a middle market private equity firm with over $1.5 billion of capital under management[149][150]
Clifton S. Robbins left KKR to join competitor General Atlantic Partners in 2000 and later founded Blue Harbour Group,[151] a private investment firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut.[152]
Edward A. Gilhuly and Scott Stuart left KKR in 2004 to launch Sageview Capital. Prior to this, Gilhuly was the managing partner of KKR's European operations, based in London; Stuart managed KKR's energy and consumer products industry groups.[152]
Ted Ammon, started several new ventures including Big Flower Press, which printed newspaper circulars, and Chancery Lane Capital, a boutique private equity firm, before being murdered in his Long Island home October 2001. The lover of his estranged, now deceased wife, Generosa, was later convicted.[152][153][154][155]
Paul Hazen, served as chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo (1995–2001).[156] Hazen later returned to KKR to serve as chairman of Accel-KKR, a joint venture with Accel Partners and later as chairman of KKR's publicly listed affiliate, KFN.
Clive Hollick, Baron Hollick, CEO of United News and Media (1996–2005)
Ken Mehlman joined KKR in 2008 as Global Head of Public Affairs.[157]
David Petraeus, selected to serve as chairman of the newly formed KKR Global Institute (2013—present)[158]
Joseph Grundfest, Professor at Stanford Law School and youngest SEC Commissioner

KKR & Co. L.P. (formerly known as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.) is an American multinational private equity firm, specializing in leveraged buyouts, headquartered in New York City. The firm sponsors and manages private equity investment funds. The firm has completed over $400 billion of private equity transactions since its inception.[3][4]
The firm was founded in 1976 by Jerome Kohlberg, Jr., and cousins Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, all of whom had previously worked together at Bear Stearns, where they completed some of the earliest leveraged buyout transactions. Since its founding, KKR has completed a number of transactions including the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, which was the largest buyout in history to that point, as well as the 2007 buyout of TXU, which is currently the largest buyout completed to date.[5][6] KKR has completed investments in over 160 companies since 1977, completing at least one investment in every year except in 1982 and in 1990.[7]
KKR has 13 additional offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.[1] The firm is currently located in the Solow Building (9 W. 57th Street), but recently announced its intentions to occupy a newly constructed 30 Hudson Yards.[8]
In October 2009, KKR listed shares in the company through KKR & Co., an affiliate that holds 30% of the firm's ownership equity, with the remainder held by the firm's partners. In March 2010, KKR filed to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),[9] with trading commencing four months later, on July 15, 2010.

Roberts and a team of approximately 140 investment professionals and 400 total employees, organized into industry-focused groups.[3] KKR is headquartered in the Solow Building at 9 West 57th Street, Manhattan, New York, with U.S. offices in Menlo Park, San Francisco, Houston, and Washington, D.C., and offices in London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Beijing, Mumbai, Dubai, Seoul, São Paulo and Sydney.[1]
KKR invests primarily through leveraged buyouts as well as growth capital investments (including "PIPE" investments in public companies). It has traditionally specialized in private equity investments, focusing on specific industry sectors where the firm has created nine dedicated investment groups. The industries in which KKR has developed a specialization include:[10]

The professionals in each of KKR's industry-focused groups are expected to have developed a proficiency in their respective industries.[10] The firm has traditionally had strong ties with its investors.[11]
Investment funds and other affiliates[edit]
Private equity funds[edit]
KKR has historically relied primarily on private equity funds, pools of committed capital that are raised from a broad array of institutional investors (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, investment banks, commercial banks, endowments, fund of funds, high-net-worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds).[3][12] As of March 31, 2014, KKR had completed fund-raising for approximately 23 traditional investment funds in the US, Europe and Asia with total committed capital of approximately US$80 billion:

Public company (NYSE: KFN)


Founded
2004


Website
www.kkrfinancial.com


KKR Financial (NYSE: KFN) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) and specialty finance company that invests in residential and commercial mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities as well as corporate loans and debt securities, asset-backed securities and equity securities. KFN was founded in 2004 raising $795 million in a private placement and raised $849 million in a June 2005 initial public offering, increasing the size of the offering from an original $600 million target.[14] KKR had initially considered structuring KFN as a business development company like Apollo Management's Apollo Investment Corporation but chose to pursue the REIT structure to capitalize on the strength in REIT valuations at the time.[14]
KFN was an early casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis and in September 2007, Henry Kravis and George Roberts injected $270 million into the company. On February 20, 2008, KFN was once again forced to delay the repayment of billions of dollars of commercial paper, and began a new round of talks with creditors.[15] In April, KFN sold a controlling interest in a real estate subsidiary to an investment firm to raise cash and entered an agreement with the noteholders of certain secured commercial paper issued by two asset-backed entities. Following the transaction, KFN converted from a REIT to a LLC.[16]
KKR Private Equity Investors[edit]

Public company (Euronext: KPE)


Founded
2006


Website
www.kkrpei.com


KKR Private Equity Investors (Euronext: KPE) is a publicly traded private equity fund that invests as a fund of funds in KKR private equity funds. KPE also co-invests in transactions alongside KKR's private equity funds. KPE was founded in 2006. In May 2006, KKR raised $5 billion in an initial public offering for a KPE to serve as a new permanent investment vehicle listing it on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam. KKR raised three times more than it expected, as many of the investors in KPE were hedge funds seeking exposure to private equity but could not make long term commitments to private equity funds. As private equity had been booming in preceding years, investing in a KKR fund was attractive to investors.[17]
However, KPE's first-day performance was lackluster, trading down 1.7% and trading volume was limited.[18] Initially, a handful of other private equity firms and hedge funds had planned to follow KKR's lead but shelved those plans when KPE's performance continued to falter after its IPO. KPE's stock declined from an IPO price of €25 per share to €18.16 (a 27% decline) at the end of 2007 and a low of €11.45 (a 54.2% decline) per share in Q1 2008.[19]
KPE disclosed in May 2008 that it had completed approximately $300 million of secondary sales of selected limited partnership interests in, and undrawn commitments to, certain KKR-managed funds in order to generate liquidity and repay borrowings.[20]
In October 2009 KPE changed its name to KKR & Co. (Guernsey) L.P.,[21] which was delisted from Euronext Amsterdam in July 2010 while common units of KKR & Co. L.P. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KKR”.[22]

Founding and early history[edit]
Running the corporate finance department for Bear Stearns in the 1960s and 1970s, Jerome Kohlberg and later with protégés Henry Kravis and George Roberts completed a series of what they described as "bootstrap" investments beginning in 1964–65. They targeted family-owned businesses, many of which had been founded in the years following World War II which by the 1960s and 1970s were facing succession issues. Many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive.[4]




Henry Kravis speaking at the World Economic Forum in 2009


Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973), as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Despite a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.[23]
By 1976, tensions [clarification needed] had built up between Bear Stearns and Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts, which led to the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities. In 1976, Kravis had been required to serve as interim CEO of a failing direct mail company named Advo.[citation needed]
The new KKR completed its first buyout, that of manufacturer A.J. Industries, in 1977. KKR raised capital from a small group of investors including the Hillman Company and First Chicago Bank. By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising its first institutional fund with over $30 million of investor commitments.[24] In 1981, KKR expanded its investor base significantly when the Oregon State Treasury's public pension fund invested in KKR's acquisition of retailer Fred Meyer, Inc. Oregon State remains an active investor in KKR funds.[4]
KKR closed out the 1970s completing the public-to-private buyout of Houdaille Industries in 1979,[25] probably the largest take-private of a public company to that point. As the 1980s began, KKR was among the most prominent practitioner of leveraged buyouts and would prove the most prolific of the private equity investors in the 1980s.[4] Among the firm's most notable acquisitions during the 1980s buyout boom were the following:

KKR acquired the company for $3.3 billion in early 1988 but faced issues with the buyout almost immediately. Most notably, a subsidiary of Jim Walter Corp (Celotex) faced a large asbestos lawsuit and incurred liabilities that the courts ruled would need to be satisfied by the parent company. In 1989, the holding company which KKR used for the Jim Walter buyout filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Buyout of RJR Nabisco[edit]
Main article: RJR Nabisco
After the 1987 resignation of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded his own private equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm was responsible for the 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco proved to be not only the largest buyout in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign of the end of the 1980s buyout boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest buyout for the next 17 years, was chronicled in Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.[33]
In 1988, F. Ross Johnson was the President and CEO of RJR Nabisco, formed in 1985 by the merger of Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a leading producer of food products (Shredded Wheat, Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Planters peanuts, Life Savers, Del Monte Fruit and Vegetables, and Snickers Chocolate) as well as Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes. In October 1988, Johnson proposed a $17 billion ($75 per share) management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton and its parent company, American Express.[34][35]
Several days later, Kravis, who had originally suggested the idea of the buyout to Johnson, presented a new bid for $20.3 billion ($90 per share) financed with an aggressive debt package.[36][37][38] KKR had the support of significant equity co-investments from leading pension funds and other institutional investors. Investors included Coca-Cola, Georgia-Pacific and United Technologies corporate pension funds, as well as endowments from MIT, Harvard and the New York State Common Retirement Fund[12] However, KKR faced criticism from existing investors over the firm's use of hostile tactics in the buyout of RJR.[39]
KKR proposed to provide a joint offer with Johnson and Shearson Lehman but was rebuffed and Johnson attempted to stonewall KKR's access to financial information from RJR.[40][41][42][43] Rival private equity firm, Forstmann Little & Co. was invited into the process by Shearson Lehman but attempted to provide a bid for RJR with a consortium of Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Procter & Gamble, Ralston Purina and Castle & Cooke.[44]
Ultimately the Forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for RJR.[45] Many of the major banking players of the day, including Shearson Lehman Hutton, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties.

In November 1988, RJR set guidelines for a final bid submission at the end of the month.[46] The management and Shearson group submitted a final bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis and KKR. KKR's final bid of $109, while a lower dollar figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of RJR Nabisco.[47] KKR's offer was guaranteed, whereas the management offer lacked a "reset", meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated $112 per share.[48]
Additionally, many in RJR's board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of Ross Johnson' unprecedented golden parachute deal.[49][50] Time Magazine featured Ross Johnson on the cover of their December 1988 issue along with the headline, "A Game of Greed: This man could pocket $100 million from the largest corporate takeover in history. Has the buyout craze gone too far?".[51] KKR's offer was welcomed by the board, and, to some observers, it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a deal-breaker in KKR's favor was little more than an excuse to reject Ross Johnson's higher payout of $112 per share. Johnson received $53 million from the buyout.[52] KKR collected a $75 million fee in the RJR takeover.[53] At $31.1 billion of transaction value (including assumed debt), RJR Nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history.[54]
In 2006 and 2007, a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which, for the first time, surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. The deal was first surpassed in July 2006 by the $33 billion buyout of U.S. hospital operator Hospital Corporation of America, in which KKR participated, though the RJR deal was larger, adjusted for inflation. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–07 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. The RJR transaction benefited many of the parties involved. Investment bankers and lawyers who advised KKR walked away with over $1 billion in fees. Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities. Size did not, however, guarantee success as the high purchase price and debt load would burden the performance of the investment, which KKR overcame, raising a new investment fund and continuing to invest throughout the 1990s.[55]
Early 1990s: The aftermath of RJR Nabisco[edit]

The buyout of RJR Nabisco was completed in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions.[56][57][58] After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.[4]
As the new decade began, KKR began restructuring RJR. In January 1990, it completed the sale of RJR's Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt.[59] Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections and public offerings of stock to provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders. KKR's equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of RJR had been only $1.5 billion.[60][61] In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company.[62]
RJR issued additional stock to the public in March 1991 to further reduce debt, resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of RJR's debt from junk to investment grade. KKR began to reduce its ownership in RJR in 1994, when its stock in RJR was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of Borden, Inc., a producer of food and beverage products, consumer products, and industrial products, in an unprecedented and complex transaction.[63][64] [65][66] The following year, in 1995, KKR would divest itself of its final stake in RJR Nabisco when Borden sold a $638 million block of stock.[67]
While KKR no longer had any ownership of RJR Nabisco by 1995, its original investment would not be fully realized until KKR exited its last investment in 2004. After sixteen years of efforts, including contributing new equity, taking RJR public, asset sales and exchanging shares of RJR for the ownership of Borden, Inc., KKR finally sold the last remnants of its 1989 investment. In July 2004, KKR agreed to sell its stock in Borden Chemical to Apollo Management for $1.2 billion.[68]
Early 1990s: Investments[edit]
In the early 1990s, the absence of an active high yield market prompted KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR's largest investments in the 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988.[69] KKR created Primedia's predecessor, K-III Communications,[70] a platform to buy media properties, initially completing the $310 million divisional buyout of the book club division of Macmillan along with the assets of Intertec Publishing Corporation in May 1989.[71][72]
During the early 1990s, K-III continued acquiring publishing assets, including a $650 million acquisition from News Corporation in 1991.[73] K-III went public, however instead of cashing out, KKR continued to make new investments in the company in 1998, 2000 and 2001 to support acquisition activity.[74] In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR's preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the company's stock collapsed.[72]
In 1991, KKR partnered with Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in the 1991 acquisition of the Bank of New England, from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[75] In January 1996, KKR would exchange its investment for a 7.5% interest in Fleet Bank.[76] KKR completed the 1992 buyout of American Re Corporation from Aetna[77] as well as a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies and owner of Denny's in 1992.[78] Among the other notable investments KKR completed in the early 1990s included World Color Press (1993–95),[79] RELTEC Corporation (1995) and Bruno's (1995).[80]
1996–1999[edit]
By the mid-1990s, the debt markets were improving and KKR had moved on from the RJR Nabisco buyout. In 1996, KKR was able to complete the bulk of fundraising for what was then a record $6 billion private equity fund, the KKR 1996 Fund.[81] However, KKR was still burdened by the performance of the RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media.[82] KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals).[4]




KKR acquired Regal Cinemas in 1998, only to see the company in bankruptcy by 2000


KKR's activity level would accelerate over the second half of the 1990s making a series of notable investments including Spalding Holdings Corporation and Evenflo (1996),[83] Newsquest (1996),[84] KinderCare Learning Centers (1997),[85] Amphenol Corporation (1997),[86] Randalls Food Markets (1997),[87][88] The Boyds Collection (1998),[89] MedCath Corporation (1998),[90] Willis Group Holdings (1998),[91] Smiths Group (1999), and Wincor Nixdorf (1999).[92]
KKR's largest investment of the 1990s would be one of its least successful. In January 1998, KKR and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst agreed to the $1.5 billion buyout of Regal Entertainment Group.[93] KKR and Hicks Muse had initially intended to combine Regal with Act III Cinemas, which KKR had acquired in 1997 for $706 million[94] and United Artists Theaters, which Hicks Muse had agreed to acquire for $840 million in November 1997. Shortly after agreeing to the Regal takeover, the deal with United Artists fell apart, destroying the strategy to eliminate costs by building a larger combined company.[95] Two years later, in 2000, Regal encountered significant financial issues and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection; the company passed to billionaire investor Philip Anschutz.[96]
2000–2005[edit]




Shoppers Drug Mart, the Canadian pharmacy was one of several successful buyouts in the early 2000s[97]


At the start of the 21st century, the landscape of large leveraged buyout firms was changing. Several large and storied firms, including Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Forstmann Little & Company were dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble. Although, KKR's track record since RJR Nabisco was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.[4]
Additionally, KKR was one of the few firms that was able to complete large leveraged buyout transactions in the years immediately following the collapse of the Internet bubble, including Shoppers Drug Mart and Bell Canada Yellow Pages.[4][98] KKR was able to realize its investment in Shoppers Drug Mart through a 2002 IPO and subsequent public stock offerings.[97] The directories business would be taken public in 2004 as Yellow Pages Income Fund, a Canadian income trust.[99]




KKR led a consortium in the buyout of Toys "R" Us in 2004


In 2004 a consortium comprising KKR, Bain Capital and real estate development company Vornado Realty Trust announced the $6.6 billion acquisition of Toys "R" Us, the toy retailer. A month earlier, Cerberus Capital Management, made a $5.5 billion offer for both the toy and baby supplies businesses.[100] The Toys 'R' Us buyout was one of the largest in several years.[101] Following this transaction, by the end of 2004 and in 2005, major buyouts were once again becoming common and market observers were stunned by the leverage levels and financing terms obtained by financial sponsors in their buyouts.[102]
In 2005, KKR was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable given the number of firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.[103][104]
Since 2005 and the Buyout Boom[edit]
In 2006, KKR raised a new $17.6 billion fund the KKR 2006 Fund, with which the firm began executing a series of some of the largest buyouts in history. KKR's $44 billion takeover of Texas-based power utility, TXU, in 2007, proved to be the largest leveraged buyout of the mid-2000s buyout boom and the largest buyout completed to date.[105] Among the most notable companies acquired by KKR in 2006 and 2007 were the following:

HCA
2006
KKR and Bain Capital, together with Merrill Lynch and the Frist family (which had founded the company) completed a $31.6 billion acquisition of the hospital company, 17 years after it was taken private for the first time in a management buyout. At the time of its announcement, the HCA buyout would be the first of several to set new records for the largest buyout, eclipsing the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco. It would later be surpassed by the buyouts of Equity Office Properties, and TXU.
[106]


NXP Semiconductors
2006
In August 2006, a consortium of KKR, Silver Lake Partners and AlpInvest Partners acquired a controlling 80.1% share of semiconductors unit of Philips for €6.4 billion. The new company, based in the Netherlands, was renamed NXP Semiconductors.
[107]


TDC A/S
2006
The Danish phone company was acquired by KKR, Apax Partners, Providence Equity Partners and Permira for €12.2 billion ($15.3 billion), which at the time made it the second largest European buyout in history.
[108][109]


Dollar General
2007
KKR completed a buyout of the chain of discount stores operating in the U.S.
[110]


Alliance Boots
2007
KKR and Stefano Pessina, the company’s deputy chairman and largest shareholder, acquired the UK drug store retailer for £12.4 billion ($24.8 billion) including assumed debt, after increasing their bid more than 40% amidst intense competition from Terra Firma Capital Partners and Wellcome Trust. The buyout came only a year after the merger of Boots Group plc (Boots the Chemist), and Alliance UniChem plc.
[111][112]


Biomet
2007
Blackstone Group, KKR, TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs acquired the medical devices company for $11.6 billion.
[113]


First Data
2007
KKR and TPG Capital completed the $29 billion buyout of the credit and debit card payment processor and former parent of Western Union. Michael Capellas, previously the CEO of MCI Communications and Compaq was named CEO of the privately held company.
[114][115]


TXU (Energy Future Holdings)
2007
An investor group led by KKR and TPG Capital and together with Goldman Sachs completed the $44.37 billion[116] buyout of the regulated utility and power producer. The investor group had to work closely with ERCOT regulators to gain approval of the transaction but had significant experience with the regulators from their earlier buyout of Texas Genco. TXU is the largest buyout in history, and retained this distinction when the announced buyout of BCE failed to close in December 2008. The deal was notable for a drastic change in environmental policy for the energy giant, in terms of its carbon emissions from coal power plants and funding alternative energy.
[117][118]


Other non-buyout investments completed by KKR during this period included Legg Mason, Sun Microsystems, Tarkett, Longview Power Plant and Seven Network. In October 2006, KKR acquired a 50% stake in Tarkett, a France-based distributor of flooring products, in a deal valued at about €1.4 billion ($1.8 billion). On November 20, 2006, KKR announced it would form a A$4 billion partnership with the Seven Network of Australia.[119] On January 23, 2007, KKR announced it would invest $700 million through a PIPE investment in Sun Microsystems.[120] In January 2008, KKR announced it had made a $1.25 billion PIPE investment in Legg Mason through a convertible preferred stock offering.[121]
In addition to its successful buyout transactions, KKR was involved in the failed buyout of Harman International Industries (NYSE: HAR), an upscale audio equipment maker. On April 26, 2007, Harman announced it had entered an agreement to be acquired by KKR and Goldman Sachs.[122] As the financing markets became more adverse [clarification needed] in the summer of 2007, the buyout was on tenuous ground. In September 2007, KKR and Goldman backed out of the $8 billion buyout of Harman. By the end of the day, Harman's shares had plummeted by more than 24% upon the news.[123]

Initial public offering[edit]
In 2007, KKR filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission[3] to raise $1.25 billion by selling an ownership interest in its management company.[124] The filing came less than two weeks after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.[125]
The following year, in July 2008, KKR announced a new plan to list its shares. The plan called for KKR to complete a reverse takeover of its listed affiliate KKR Private Equity Investors in exchange for a 21% interest in the firm.[126] In November 2008, KKR announced a delay of this transaction until 2009. Shares of KPE had declined significantly in the second half of 2008 with the onset of the credit crunch. KKR has announced that it expects to close the transaction in 2009.[127] In October 2009, KKR listed shares in KKR & Co. on the Euronext exchange, replacing KPE and anticipates a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. The public entity represents a 30% interest in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In October 2010, KKR acquired about nine members of Goldman Sachs Group proprietary trading team after entertaining offers from investment firms such as Perella Weinberg and Blackrock. With Goldman shutting down its proprietary trading operations, its executives, led by Bob Howard, will help KKR expand beyond leveraged buyouts into areas such as hedge funds.
2010 to present day[edit]
In January 2014, KKR acquired Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc for $2.4 billion from two private equity companies - Stone Point, and Hellman & Friedman.[128]
In June 2014, KKR announced it was taking a one-third stake in a Spanish energy business of Acciona Energy, at a cost of €417 million ($567 million). The international renewable energy generation business operates renewable assets, largely wind farms, across 14 countries including the United States, Italy and South Africa.[129]
In August 2014, KKR announced it was investing $400 million to acquire Fujian Sunner Development, China's largest chicken farmer, which breeds, processes and supplies frozen and fresh chickens to consumers and corporate clients, such as KFC and McDonald's, across China.[130]
In September 2014, the firm invested $90 million in a lighting and electrics firm Savant Systems.[131]
In January 2015, KKR confirmed its purchase of British rail ticket website thetrainline.com, previously owned by Exponent. The purchase sum is unknown.[132]
On October 12, 2015, KKR announced that it has entered into definitive agreement with Allianz Capital Partners to acquire their majority stake in Selecta Group, a European vending services operator.[133]
On September 1, 2016, KKR announced that it had acquired Epicor Software Corporation, an American software company.[134]
In October 2016, it was reported that KKR invested $250 million in OVH to be used for further international expansion.[135] This funding round valued OVH at over $1 billion, making it a unicorn.
In December 2016, the Lonza Group announced it would acquire Capsugel for $5.5 billion from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.[136]
In February 2017 KKR were reported to be trying to take over the international market research company ARI GfK SE.[137] In July of the same year KKR acquired WebMD Health Corp for $2.8 billion.[138]
Notable current and former employees[edit]
Over the years, KKR has seen the departure of many of its original partners, the most notable being original co-founder Jerome Kohlberg. After a leave of absence due to an illness in 1985, Kohlberg returned to find increasing differences in strategy with his partners Kravis and Roberts.[139] In 1987, Kohlberg left KKR to found a new private equity firm Kohlberg & Company. Kohlberg & Company returned to the investment style that Kohlberg had originally practiced at Bear Stearns and in KKR's earlier years, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies.[4][140][141]
Since 1996, general partners of KKR have included Henry Kravis, George R. Roberts, Paul Raether, Robert MacDonnell, Jose Gandarillas, Michael Michelson, Saul Fox, James Greene, Michael Tokarz, Clifton Robbins, Scott Stuart, Perry Golkin and Edward Gilhuly.[142] Among those who left were Saul Fox, Ted Ammon, Ned Gilhuly, Mike Tokarz and Scott Stuart who had been instrumental in establishing KKR's reputation and track record in the 1980s.[143] KKR remains tightly controlled by Kravis and Roberts. The issue of succession has remained an important consideration for KKR's future as an ongoing institutionalized firm.

Scott C. Nuttall (born 1972), heads KKR's fastest-growing department, the Global Capital and Asset Management Group, which includes Asset Management, Capital Markets and Client and Partner Group. He joined KKR in November 1996 after leaving the Blackstone Group. His group, the firm's fastest-growing division, has $25 billion under management. With the support of co-founder George Roberts, Nuttall has largely spearheaded the campaign to expand KKR beyond its institutional investors (legacy and otherwise) into credit investment, and alternative investments, pointing out that there are billions "in revenues up for grabs".[144][145][146] He has been named Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers with Joseph Bae on July 17, 2017 to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the firm. He will concentrate on KKR's corporate and real estate credit, capital markets, hedge fund and capital raising businesses together with the firm's corporate development, balance sheet and strategic growth initiatives.[147] New York Times called him and Joseph Bae as potential successors.[148] He graduated from University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Science degree.
Joseph Bae (born circa 1972) joined KKR from Goldman Sachs in 1996. Most recently, he was the Managing Partner of KKR Asia and the Global Head of KKR's Infrastructure and Energy Real Asset businesses. Mr. Bae has been the architect of KKR's Asian expansion since 2005. He has been named Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers with Scott Nuttall on July 17, 2017 to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the firm. Mr. Bae will focus on KKR's global private equity businesses as well as the Firm's real asset platforms across energy, infrastructure and real estate private equity.[147] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard College.
Saul A. Fox left KKR in 1997 to found Fox Paine & Company, a middle market private equity firm with over $1.5 billion of capital under management[149][150]
Clifton S. Robbins left KKR to join competitor General Atlantic Partners in 2000 and later founded Blue Harbour Group,[151] a private investment firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut.[152]
Edward A. Gilhuly and Scott Stuart left KKR in 2004 to launch Sageview Capital. Prior to this, Gilhuly was the managing partner of KKR's European operations, based in London; Stuart managed KKR's energy and consumer products industry groups.[152]
Ted Ammon, started several new ventures including Big Flower Press, which printed newspaper circulars, and Chancery Lane Capital, a boutique private equity firm, before being murdered in his Long Island home October 2001. The lover of his estranged, now deceased wife, Generosa, was later convicted.[152][153][154][155]
Paul Hazen, served as chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo (1995–2001).[156] Hazen later returned to KKR to serve as chairman of Accel-KKR, a joint venture with Accel Partners and later as chairman of KKR's publicly listed affiliate, KFN.
Clive Hollick, Baron Hollick, CEO of United News and Media (1996–2005)
Ken Mehlman joined KKR in 2008 as Global Head of Public Affairs.[157]
David Petraeus, selected to serve as chairman of the newly formed KKR Global Institute (2013—present)[158]
Joseph Grundfest, Professor at Stanford Law School and youngest SEC Commissioner

PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)– KKR, a leading global investment firm, today announced the final closing of KKR Americas XII Fund (“the Fund”), a $13.9 billion fund focused on opportunistic investments in private equity-related transactions primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico. KKR will be investing nearly $1.4 billion in capital alongside investors through the Firm’s balance sheet and employee commitments.
“As we mark this important milestone in our Americas private equity business and close our 12th flagship private equity fund, we are grateful to our investors, both old and new, for their continued confidence in us. In today’s increasingly complex world, we are pleased that they share our enthusiasm for the opportunities that lie ahead in the Americas, in particular the U.S. where we anticipate significant long-term investment opportunities and where we have been investing for more than four decades and six economic cycles,” said Alexander Navab, KKR Member and Head of Americas Private Equity. “Throughout this period, we have invested through economic challenges and volatility but have remained focused on delivering top quartile performance. That continues to be our focus as we work hard to support our investors’ goals and the needs of their beneficiaries.”
Alisa Amarosa Wood, KKR Member and Head of Private Market Products Group, added: “Our optimism about the future, our team, and our belief that alignment is the best demonstration of our partnership, is why KKR is committing more money into this fund than any private equity fund in our history.”
KKR’s Americas private equity platform invests across seven industry teams, including Energy; Financial Services; Healthcare; Industrials; Media & Communications; Retail and Consumer; and Technology sectors. In addition to traditional management buyouts and build-ups, the business seeks to find opportunities to provide growth capital, as well as minority investments, and public toehold investments where KKR can partner with public companies, leveraging the Firm’s industry expertise and operational capabilities to add value beyond just providing capital. The Americas private equity team consists of over 60 experienced investment professionals, and is supported by over 20 operational executives in KKR Capstone.
Americas XII is the largest Americas-focused private equity fund, according to data sourced from Preqin. It received strong backing from a diverse group of new and existing global investors, including public and corporate pensions, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowments, private banking platforms, family offices and high net worth individual investors.
KKR has been investing in North America since the Firm’s establishment in 1976 and has been one of the most active private equity investors, having completed or announced over 225 transactions with a total enterprise value of approximately $495 billion. Through 11 North America private equity funds, the Firm has invested approximately $48.5 billion of equity in the Americas. Since inception, KKR’s first 18 private equity funds have delivered over two times total capital invested on a gross basis. This corresponds to a cumulative Gross IRR of 25.6% (net IRR of 18.9%) and a Gross multiple of 2.1x (net multiple of 1.9x). The predecessor fund of Americas XII, KKR North America Fund XI began investing in late 2012 and is now fully deployed. It has generated a Gross IRR of 24.0% (net IRR of 18.1%) and a Gross Multiple of 1.5x (net multiple of 1.4x) as of December 31, 2016. With the closing of this fund, KKR’s Americas private equity business manages approximately $36 billion in assets under management.

KKR & Co. L.P. (formerly known as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.) is an American multinational private equity firm, specializing in leveraged buyouts, headquartered in New York City. The firm sponsors and manages private equity investment funds. The firm has completed over $400 billion of private equity transactions since its inception.[3][4]
The firm was founded in 1976 by Jerome Kohlberg, Jr., and cousins Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, all of whom had previously worked together at Bear Stearns, where they completed some of the earliest leveraged buyout transactions. Since its founding, KKR has completed a number of transactions including the 1989 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, which was the largest buyout in history to that point, as well as the 2007 buyout of TXU, which is currently the largest buyout completed to date.[5][6] KKR has completed investments in over 160 companies since 1977, completing at least one investment in every year except in 1982 and in 1990.[7]
KKR has 13 additional offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.[1] The firm is currently located in the Solow Building (9 W. 57th Street), but recently announced its intentions to occupy a newly constructed 30 Hudson Yards.[8]
In October 2009, KKR listed shares in the company through KKR & Co., an affiliate that holds 30% of the firm's ownership equity, with the remainder held by the firm's partners. In March 2010, KKR filed to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),[9] with trading commencing four months later, on July 15, 2010.

Investment funds and other affiliates[edit]
Private equity funds[edit]
KKR has historically relied primarily on private equity funds, pools of committed capital that are raised from a broad array of institutional investors (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, investment banks, commercial banks, endowments, fund of funds, high-net-worth individuals, sovereign wealth funds).[3][12] As of March 31, 2014, KKR had completed fund-raising for approximately 23 traditional investment funds in the US, Europe and Asia with total committed capital of approximately US$80 billion:

Public company (NYSE: KFN)


Founded
2004


Website
www.kkrfinancial.com


KKR Financial (NYSE: KFN) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) and specialty finance company that invests in residential and commercial mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities as well as corporate loans and debt securities, asset-backed securities and equity securities. KFN was founded in 2004 raising $795 million in a private placement and raised $849 million in a June 2005 initial public offering, increasing the size of the offering from an original $600 million target.[14] KKR had initially considered structuring KFN as a business development company like Apollo Management's Apollo Investment Corporation but chose to pursue the REIT structure to capitalize on the strength in REIT valuations at the time.[14]
KFN was an early casualty of the subprime mortgage crisis and in September 2007, Henry Kravis and George Roberts injected $270 million into the company. On February 20, 2008, KFN was once again forced to delay the repayment of billions of dollars of commercial paper, and began a new round of talks with creditors.[15] In April, KFN sold a controlling interest in a real estate subsidiary to an investment firm to raise cash and entered an agreement with the noteholders of certain secured commercial paper issued by two asset-backed entities. Following the transaction, KFN converted from a REIT to a LLC.[16]

Public company (Euronext: KPE)


Founded
2006


Website
www.kkrpei.com


KKR Private Equity Investors (Euronext: KPE) is a publicly traded private equity fund that invests as a fund of funds in KKR private equity funds. KPE also co-invests in transactions alongside KKR's private equity funds. KPE was founded in 2006. In May 2006, KKR raised $5 billion in an initial public offering for a KPE to serve as a new permanent investment vehicle listing it on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam. KKR raised three times more than it expected, as many of the investors in KPE were hedge funds seeking exposure to private equity but could not make long term commitments to private equity funds. As private equity had been booming in preceding years, investing in a KKR fund was attractive to investors.[17]
However, KPE's first-day performance was lackluster, trading down 1.7% and trading volume was limited.[18] Initially, a handful of other private equity firms and hedge funds had planned to follow KKR's lead but shelved those plans when KPE's performance continued to falter after its IPO. KPE's stock declined from an IPO price of €25 per share to €18.16 (a 27% decline) at the end of 2007 and a low of €11.45 (a 54.2% decline) per share in Q1 2008.[19]
KPE disclosed in May 2008 that it had completed approximately $300 million of secondary sales of selected limited partnership interests in, and undrawn commitments to, certain KKR-managed funds in order to generate liquidity and repay borrowings.[20]
In October 2009 KPE changed its name to KKR & Co. (Guernsey) L.P.,[21] which was delisted from Euronext Amsterdam in July 2010 while common units of KKR & Co. L.P. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KKR”.[22]

Founding and early history[edit]
Running the corporate finance department for Bear Stearns in the 1960s and 1970s, Jerome Kohlberg and later with protégés Henry Kravis and George Roberts completed a series of what they described as "bootstrap" investments beginning in 1964–65. They targeted family-owned businesses, many of which had been founded in the years following World War II which by the 1960s and 1970s were facing succession issues. Many of these companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors and so a sale to a financial buyer could prove attractive.[4]




Henry Kravis speaking at the World Economic Forum in 2009


Their acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. In the following years the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973), as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. Despite a number of highly successful investments, the $27 million investment in Cobblers ended in bankruptcy.[23]
By 1976, tensions [clarification needed] had built up between Bear Stearns and Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts, which led to the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. in that year. Most notably, Bear Stearns executive Cy Lewis had rejected repeated proposals to form a dedicated investment fund within Bear Stearns and Lewis took exception to the amount of time spent on outside activities. In 1976, Kravis had been required to serve as interim CEO of a failing direct mail company named Advo.[citation needed]
The new KKR completed its first buyout, that of manufacturer A.J. Industries, in 1977. KKR raised capital from a small group of investors including the Hillman Company and First Chicago Bank. By 1978, with the revision of the ERISA regulations, the nascent KKR was successful in raising its first institutional fund with over $30 million of investor commitments.[24] In 1981, KKR expanded its investor base significantly when the Oregon State Treasury's public pension fund invested in KKR's acquisition of retailer Fred Meyer, Inc. Oregon State remains an active investor in KKR funds.[4]
KKR closed out the 1970s completing the public-to-private buyout of Houdaille Industries in 1979,[25] probably the largest take-private of a public company to that point. As the 1980s began, KKR was among the most prominent practitioner of leveraged buyouts and would prove the most prolific of the private equity investors in the 1980s.[4] Among the firm's most notable acquisitions during the 1980s buyout boom were the following:

Company Description

Malone & Hyde
1984
KKR completed the first buyout of a public company by tender offer, by acquiring the food distributor and supermarket operator together with the company's chairman Joseph R. Hyde III.
[26]


Wometco Enterprises
1984
KKR completed the first billion-dollar buyout transaction to acquire the leisure-time company with interests in television, movie theaters and tourist attractions. The buyout comprised the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares for $842 million and the assumption of $170 million of the company's outstanding debt.
[27]


Beatrice Companies
1985
KKR sponsored the $6.1 billion management buyout of Beatrice, which owned Samsonite and Tropicana among other consumer brands. At the time of its closing in 1985, Beatrice was the largest buyout completed.
[28][29]


Safeway
1986
KKR completed a friendly $5.5 billion buyout of Safeway to help management avoid hostile overtures from Herbert and Robert Haft of Dart Drug. Safeway was taken public again in 1990.
[30]


Jim Walter Corp.
(later Walter Industries)
1987
KKR acquired the company for $3.3 billion in early 1988 but faced issues with the buyout almost immediately. Most notably, a subsidiary of Jim Walter Corp (Celotex) faced a large asbestos lawsuit and incurred liabilities that the courts ruled would need to be satisfied by the parent company. In 1989, the holding company which KKR used for the Jim Walter buyout filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
[31][32]


Buyout of RJR Nabisco[edit]
Main article: RJR Nabisco
After the 1987 resignation of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded his own private equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm was responsible for the 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco proved to be not only the largest buyout in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign of the end of the 1980s buyout boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest buyout for the next 17 years, was chronicled in Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.[33]
In 1988, F. Ross Johnson was the President and CEO of RJR Nabisco, formed in 1985 by the merger of Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a leading producer of food products (Shredded Wheat, Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers, Planters peanuts, Life Savers, Del Monte Fruit and Vegetables, and Snickers Chocolate) as well as Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes. In October 1988, Johnson proposed a $17 billion ($75 per share) management buyout of the company with the financial backing of investment bank Shearson Lehman Hutton and its parent company, American Express.[34][35]
Several days later, Kravis, who had originally suggested the idea of the buyout to Johnson, presented a new bid for $20.3 billion ($90 per share) financed with an aggressive debt package.[36][37][38] KKR had the support of significant equity co-investments from leading pension funds and other institutional investors. Investors included Coca-Cola, Georgia-Pacific and United Technologies corporate pension funds, as well as endowments from MIT, Harvard and the New York State Common Retirement Fund[12] However, KKR faced criticism from existing investors over the firm's use of hostile tactics in the buyout of RJR.[39]
KKR proposed to provide a joint offer with Johnson and Shearson Lehman but was rebuffed and Johnson attempted to stonewall KKR's access to financial information from RJR.[40][41][42][43] Rival private equity firm, Forstmann Little & Co. was invited into the process by Shearson Lehman but attempted to provide a bid for RJR with a consortium of Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Procter & Gamble, Ralston Purina and Castle & Cooke.[44]
Ultimately the Forstmann consortium came apart and did not provide a final bid for RJR.[45] Many of the major banking players of the day, including Shearson Lehman Hutton, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties.




Oreo cookies, one of RJR Nabisco's products


In November 1988, RJR set guidelines for a final bid submission at the end of the month.[46] The management and Shearson group submitted a final bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis and KKR. KKR's final bid of $109, while a lower dollar figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of RJR Nabisco.[47] KKR's offer was guaranteed, whereas the management offer lacked a "reset", meaning that the final share price might have been lower than their stated $112 per share.[48]
Additionally, many in RJR's board of directors had grown concerned at recent disclosures of Ross Johnson' unprecedented golden parachute deal.[49][50] Time Magazine featured Ross Johnson on the cover of their December 1988 issue along with the headline, "A Game of Greed: This man could pocket $100 million from the largest corporate takeover in history. Has the buyout craze gone too far?".[51] KKR's offer was welcomed by the board, and, to some observers, it appeared that their elevation of the reset issue as a deal-breaker in KKR's favor was little more than an excuse to reject Ross Johnson's higher payout of $112 per share. Johnson received $53 million from the buyout.[52] KKR collected a $75 million fee in the RJR takeover.[53] At $31.1 billion of transaction value (including assumed debt), RJR Nabisco was by far the largest leveraged buyout in history.[54]
In 2006 and 2007, a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed which, for the first time, surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. The deal was first surpassed in July 2006 by the $33 billion buyout of U.S. hospital operator Hospital Corporation of America, in which KKR participated, though the RJR deal was larger, adjusted for inflation. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–07 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. The RJR transaction benefited many of the parties involved. Investment bankers and lawyers who advised KKR walked away with over $1 billion in fees. Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities. Size did not, however, guarantee success as the high purchase price and debt load would burden the performance of the investment, which KKR overcame, raising a new investment fund and continuing to invest throughout the 1990s.[55]
Early 1990s: The aftermath of RJR Nabisco[edit]




KKR's headquarters in the Solow Building at 9 West 57th Street in New York City


The buyout of RJR Nabisco was completed in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load through a series of asset sales and restructuring transactions.[56][57][58] After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.[4]
As the new decade began, KKR began restructuring RJR. In January 1990, it completed the sale of RJR's Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt.[59] Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections and public offerings of stock to provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders. KKR's equity contribution as part of the original leveraged buyout of RJR had been only $1.5 billion.[60][61] In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company.[62]
RJR issued additional stock to the public in March 1991 to further reduce debt, resulting in an upgrade of the credit rating of RJR's debt from junk to investment grade. KKR began to reduce its ownership in RJR in 1994, when its stock in RJR was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of Borden, Inc., a producer of food and beverage products, consumer products, and industrial products, in an unprecedented and complex transaction.[63][64] [65][66] The following year, in 1995, KKR would divest itself of its final stake in RJR Nabisco when Borden sold a $638 million block of stock.[67]
While KKR no longer had any ownership of RJR Nabisco by 1995, its original investment would not be fully realized until KKR exited its last investment in 2004. After sixteen years of efforts, including contributing new equity, taking RJR public, asset sales and exchanging shares of RJR for the ownership of Borden, Inc., KKR finally sold the last remnants of its 1989 investment. In July 2004, KKR agreed to sell its stock in Borden Chemical to Apollo Management for $1.2 billion.[68]
Early 1990s: Investments[edit]
In the early 1990s, the absence of an active high yield market prompted KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR's largest investments in the 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988.[69] KKR created Primedia's predecessor, K-III Communications,[70] a platform to buy media properties, initially completing the $310 million divisional buyout of the book club division of Macmillan along with the assets of Intertec Publishing Corporation in May 1989.[71][72]
During the early 1990s, K-III continued acquiring publishing assets, including a $650 million acquisition from News Corporation in 1991.[73] K-III went public, however instead of cashing out, KKR continued to make new investments in the company in 1998, 2000 and 2001 to support acquisition activity.[74] In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR's preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its common stock holdings as the price of the company's stock collapsed.[72]
In 1991, KKR partnered with Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in the 1991 acquisition of the Bank of New England, from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.[75] In January 1996, KKR would exchange its investment for a 7.5% interest in Fleet Bank.[76] KKR completed the 1992 buyout of American Re Corporation from Aetna[77] as well as a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies and owner of Denny's in 1992.[78] Among the other notable investments KKR completed in the early 1990s included World Color Press (1993–95),[79] RELTEC Corporation (1995) and Bruno's (1995).[80]
1996–1999[edit]
By the mid-1990s, the debt markets were improving and KKR had moved on from the RJR Nabisco buyout. In 1996, KKR was able to complete the bulk of fundraising for what was then a record $6 billion private equity fund, the KKR 1996 Fund.[81] However, KKR was still burdened by the performance of the RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media.[82] KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals).[4]




KKR acquired Regal Cinemas in 1998, only to see the company in bankruptcy by 2000


KKR's activity level would accelerate over the second half of the 1990s making a series of notable investments including Spalding Holdings Corporation and Evenflo (1996),[83] Newsquest (1996),[84] KinderCare Learning Centers (1997),[85] Amphenol Corporation (1997),[86] Randalls Food Markets (1997),[87][88] The Boyds Collection (1998),[89] MedCath Corporation (1998),[90] Willis Group Holdings (1998),[91] Smiths Group (1999), and Wincor Nixdorf (1999).[92]
KKR's largest investment of the 1990s would be one of its least successful. In January 1998, KKR and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst agreed to the $1.5 billion buyout of Regal Entertainment Group.[93] KKR and Hicks Muse had initially intended to combine Regal with Act III Cinemas, which KKR had acquired in 1997 for $706 million[94] and United Artists Theaters, which Hicks Muse had agreed to acquire for $840 million in November 1997. Shortly after agreeing to the Regal takeover, the deal with United Artists fell apart, destroying the strategy to eliminate costs by building a larger combined company.[95] Two years later, in 2000, Regal encountered significant financial issues and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection; the company passed to billionaire investor Philip Anschutz.[96]
2000–2005[edit]




Shoppers Drug Mart, the Canadian pharmacy was one of several successful buyouts in the early 2000s[97]


At the start of the 21st century, the landscape of large leveraged buyout firms was changing. Several large and storied firms, including Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Forstmann Little & Company were dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble. Although, KKR's track record since RJR Nabisco was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.[4]
Additionally, KKR was one of the few firms that was able to complete large leveraged buyout transactions in the years immediately following the collapse of the Internet bubble, including Shoppers Drug Mart and Bell Canada Yellow Pages.[4][98] KKR was able to realize its investment in Shoppers Drug Mart through a 2002 IPO and subsequent public stock offerings.[97] The directories business would be taken public in 2004 as Yellow Pages Income Fund, a Canadian income trust.[99]




KKR led a consortium in the buyout of Toys "R" Us in 2004


In 2004 a consortium comprising KKR, Bain Capital and real estate development company Vornado Realty Trust announced the $6.6 billion acquisition of Toys "R" Us, the toy retailer. A month earlier, Cerberus Capital Management, made a $5.5 billion offer for both the toy and baby supplies businesses.[100] The Toys 'R' Us buyout was one of the largest in several years.[101] Following this transaction, by the end of 2004 and in 2005, major buyouts were once again becoming common and market observers were stunned by the leverage levels and financing terms obtained by financial sponsors in their buyouts.[102]
In 2005, KKR was one of seven private equity firms involved in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable given the number of firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.[103][104]
Since 2005 and the Buyout Boom[edit]
In 2006, KKR raised a new $17.6 billion fund the KKR 2006 Fund, with which the firm began executing a series of some of the largest buyouts in history. KKR's $44 billion takeover of Texas-based power utility, TXU, in 2007, proved to be the largest leveraged buyout of the mid-2000s buyout boom and the largest buyout completed to date.[105] Among the most notable companies acquired by KKR in 2006 and 2007 were the following:

HCA
2006
KKR and Bain Capital, together with Merrill Lynch and the Frist family (which had founded the company) completed a $31.6 billion acquisition of the hospital company, 17 years after it was taken private for the first time in a management buyout. At the time of its announcement, the HCA buyout would be the first of several to set new records for the largest buyout, eclipsing the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco. It would later be surpassed by the buyouts of Equity Office Properties, and TXU.
[106]


NXP Semiconductors
2006
In August 2006, a consortium of KKR, Silver Lake Partners and AlpInvest Partners acquired a controlling 80.1% share of semiconductors unit of Philips for €6.4 billion. The new company, based in the Netherlands, was renamed NXP Semiconductors.
[107]


TDC A/S
2006
The Danish phone company was acquired by KKR, Apax Partners, Providence Equity Partners and Permira for €12.2 billion ($15.3 billion), which at the time made it the second largest European buyout in history.
[108][109]


Dollar General
2007
KKR completed a buyout of the chain of discount stores operating in the U.S.
[110]


Alliance Boots
2007
KKR and Stefano Pessina, the company’s deputy chairman and largest shareholder, acquired the UK drug store retailer for £12.4 billion ($24.8 billion) including assumed debt, after increasing their bid more than 40% amidst intense competition from Terra Firma Capital Partners and Wellcome Trust. The buyout came only a year after the merger of Boots Group plc (Boots the Chemist), and Alliance UniChem plc.
[111][112]


Biomet
2007
Blackstone Group, KKR, TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs acquired the medical devices company for $11.6 billion.
[113]


First Data
2007
KKR and TPG Capital completed the $29 billion buyout of the credit and debit card payment processor and former parent of Western Union. Michael Capellas, previously the CEO of MCI Communications and Compaq was named CEO of the privately held company.
[114][115]


TXU (Energy Future Holdings)
2007
An investor group led by KKR and TPG Capital and together with Goldman Sachs completed the $44.37 billion[116] buyout of the regulated utility and power producer. The investor group had to work closely with ERCOT regulators to gain approval of the transaction but had significant experience with the regulators from their earlier buyout of Texas Genco. TXU is the largest buyout in history, and retained this distinction when the announced buyout of BCE failed to close in December 2008. The deal was notable for a drastic change in environmental policy for the energy giant, in terms of its carbon emissions from coal power plants and funding alternative energy.
[117][118]


Other non-buyout investments completed by KKR during this period included Legg Mason, Sun Microsystems, Tarkett, Longview Power Plant and Seven Network. In October 2006, KKR acquired a 50% stake in Tarkett, a France-based distributor of flooring products, in a deal valued at about €1.4 billion ($1.8 billion). On November 20, 2006, KKR announced it would form a A$4 billion partnership with the Seven Network of Australia.[119] On January 23, 2007, KKR announced it would invest $700 million through a PIPE investment in Sun Microsystems.[120] In January 2008, KKR announced it had made a $1.25 billion PIPE investment in Legg Mason through a convertible preferred stock offering.[121]
In addition to its successful buyout transactions, KKR was involved in the failed buyout of Harman International Industries (NYSE: HAR), an upscale audio equipment maker. On April 26, 2007, Harman announced it had entered an agreement to be acquired by KKR and Goldman Sachs.[122] As the financing markets became more adverse [clarification needed] in the summer of 2007, the buyout was on tenuous ground. In September 2007, KKR and Goldman backed out of the $8 billion buyout of Harman. By the end of the day, Harman's shares had plummeted by more than 24% upon the news.[123]

Initial public offering[edit]
In 2007, KKR filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission[3] to raise $1.25 billion by selling an ownership interest in its management company.[124] The filing came less than two weeks after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.[125]
The following year, in July 2008, KKR announced a new plan to list its shares. The plan called for KKR to complete a reverse takeover of its listed affiliate KKR Private Equity Investors in exchange for a 21% interest in the firm.[126] In November 2008, KKR announced a delay of this transaction until 2009. Shares of KPE had declined significantly in the second half of 2008 with the onset of the credit crunch. KKR has announced that it expects to close the transaction in 2009.[127] In October 2009, KKR listed shares in KKR & Co. on the Euronext exchange, replacing KPE and anticipates a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. The public entity represents a 30% interest in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In October 2010, KKR acquired about nine members of Goldman Sachs Group proprietary trading team after entertaining offers from investment firms such as Perella Weinberg and Blackrock. With Goldman shutting down its proprietary trading operations, its executives, led by Bob Howard, will help KKR expand beyond leveraged buyouts into areas such as hedge funds.
2010 to present day[edit]
In January 2014, KKR acquired Sedgwick Claims Management Services Inc for $2.4 billion from two private equity companies - Stone Point, and Hellman & Friedman.[128]
In June 2014, KKR announced it was taking a one-third stake in a Spanish energy business of Acciona Energy, at a cost of €417 million ($567 million). The international renewable energy generation business operates renewable assets, largely wind farms, across 14 countries including the United States, Italy and South Africa.[129]
In August 2014, KKR announced it was investing $400 million to acquire Fujian Sunner Development, China's largest chicken farmer, which breeds, processes and supplies frozen and fresh chickens to consumers and corporate clients, such as KFC and McDonald's, across China.[130]
In September 2014, the firm invested $90 million in a lighting and electrics firm Savant Systems.[131]
In January 2015, KKR confirmed its purchase of British rail ticket website thetrainline.com, previously owned by Exponent. The purchase sum is unknown.[132]
On October 12, 2015, KKR announced that it has entered into definitive agreement with Allianz Capital Partners to acquire their majority stake in Selecta Group, a European vending services operator.[133]
On September 1, 2016, KKR announced that it had acquired Epicor Software Corporation, an American software company.[134]
In October 2016, it was reported that KKR invested $250 million in OVH to be used for further international expansion.[135] This funding round valued OVH at over $1 billion, making it a unicorn.
In December 2016, the Lonza Group announced it would acquire Capsugel for $5.5 billion from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.[136]
In February 2017 KKR were reported to be trying to take over the international market research company ARI GfK SE.[137] In July of the same year KKR acquired WebMD Health Corp for $2.8 billion.[138]
Notable current and former employees[edit]
Over the years, KKR has seen the departure of many of its original partners, the most notable being original co-founder Jerome Kohlberg. After a leave of absence due to an illness in 1985, Kohlberg returned to find increasing differences in strategy with his partners Kravis and Roberts.[139] In 1987, Kohlberg left KKR to found a new private equity firm Kohlberg & Company. Kohlberg & Company returned to the investment style that Kohlberg had originally practiced at Bear Stearns and in KKR's earlier years, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies.[4][140][141]
Since 1996, general partners of KKR have included Henry Kravis, George R. Roberts, Paul Raether, Robert MacDonnell, Jose Gandarillas, Michael Michelson, Saul Fox, James Greene, Michael Tokarz, Clifton Robbins, Scott Stuart, Perry Golkin and Edward Gilhuly.[142] Among those who left were Saul Fox, Ted Ammon, Ned Gilhuly, Mike Tokarz and Scott Stuart who had been instrumental in establishing KKR's reputation and track record in the 1980s.[143] KKR remains tightly controlled by Kravis and Roberts. The issue of succession has remained an important consideration for KKR's future as an ongoing institutionalized firm.

Scott C. Nuttall (born 1972), heads KKR's fastest-growing department, the Global Capital and Asset Management Group, which includes Asset Management, Capital Markets and Client and Partner Group. He joined KKR in November 1996 after leaving the Blackstone Group. His group, the firm's fastest-growing division, has $25 billion under management. With the support of co-founder George Roberts, Nuttall has largely spearheaded the campaign to expand KKR beyond its institutional investors (legacy and otherwise) into credit investment, and alternative investments, pointing out that there are billions "in revenues up for grabs".[144][145][146] He has been named Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers with Joseph Bae on July 17, 2017 to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the firm. He will concentrate on KKR's corporate and real estate credit, capital markets, hedge fund and capital raising businesses together with the firm's corporate development, balance sheet and strategic growth initiatives.[147] New York Times called him and Joseph Bae as potential successors.[148] He graduated from University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Science degree.
Joseph Bae (born circa 1972) joined KKR from Goldman Sachs in 1996. Most recently, he was the Managing Partner of KKR Asia and the Global Head of KKR's Infrastructure and Energy Real Asset businesses. Mr. Bae has been the architect of KKR's Asian expansion since 2005. He has been named Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers with Scott Nuttall on July 17, 2017 to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the firm. Mr. Bae will focus on KKR's global private equity businesses as well as the Firm's real asset platforms across energy, infrastructure and real estate private equity.[147] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard College.
Saul A. Fox left KKR in 1997 to found Fox Paine & Company, a middle market private equity firm with over $1.5 billion of capital under management[149][150]
Clifton S. Robbins left KKR to join competitor General Atlantic Partners in 2000 and later founded Blue Harbour Group,[151] a private investment firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut.[152]
Edward A. Gilhuly and Scott Stuart left KKR in 2004 to launch Sageview Capital. Prior to this, Gilhuly was the managing partner of KKR's European operations, based in London; Stuart managed KKR's energy and consumer products industry groups.[152]
Ted Ammon, started several new ventures including Big Flower Press, which printed newspaper circulars, and Chancery Lane Capital, a boutique private equity firm, before being murdered in his Long Island home October 2001. The lover of his estranged, now deceased wife, Generosa, was later convicted.[152][153][154][155]
Paul Hazen, served as chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo (1995–2001).[156] Hazen later returned to KKR to serve as chairman of Accel-KKR, a joint venture with Accel Partners and later as chairman of KKR's publicly listed affiliate, KFN.
Clive Hollick, Baron Hollick, CEO of United News and Media (1996–2005)
Ken Mehlman joined KKR in 2008 as Global Head of Public Affairs.[157]
David Petraeus, selected to serve as chairman of the newly formed KKR Global Institute (2013—present)[158]
Joseph Grundfest, Professor at Stanford Law School and youngest SEC Commissioner

KKR closes $9 bln flagship fund, several debut vehicles
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts closed its North America Fund XI on $9 billion, along with its debut real estate and special situations vehicles.

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is closing funds all over the place.
The firm revealed during its year-end and fourth-quarter earnings call on Feb. 6 that it had closed three significant funds as of Dec. 31, 2013.
Those funds include the flagship North America Fund XI (NAXI), which closed on $9 billion. It’s not clear exactly when the close happened. Fund XI had been in the market since 2011 seeking at least $8 billion.
The prior flagship vehicle, KKR 2006 Fund, closed on $17.6 billion in 2008. That fund was generating a 1.41x multiple and a 7.70 percent internal rate of return as of Sept. 30, according to performance information from the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund.
NAXI is already about 32 percent deployed, according to the earnings report.
“We are excited to have so many new as well as our existing investors be part of the new fund,” KKR said in a statement. “We think it is a testament to the opportunity for PE in the Americas today. Our strategy has been very consistent over the years and private equity funds. We are focused on investing in large, complex, market leading franchise businesses where we can help improve them and drive operational value creation. ”
KKR also held final closes on its debut real estate private equity fund, which collected $1.5 billion, and its debut special situations fund, which raised $2 billion, the firm said.
Altogether, KKR raised about $21 billion across all segments. 





KKR has also launched fundraising for its European IV vehicle, although it did not disclose a target. The firm is also in the market raising its first Energy Income and Growth Fund targeting oil and gas development. That fund, which has a target of $1.5 billion, has already collected $1.4 billion and will close in the next few months, said Scott Nuttall, head of KKR’s global capital and asset management group, on the call.
Nuttall gave an overview of investment vehicles that may come back to market soon.
“[We have] a lot of Fund I’s getting close to being fully invested,” Nuttall said. These include vehicles focusing on infrastructure, direct lending and mezzanine lending.
KKR also sees opportunities around raising funds for illiquid private credit vehicles targeting Europe, Nuttall said. The firm anticipates “marrying” the liquid credit capabilities of European credit manager Avoca Capital, which the firm is in the process of acquiring, with KKR’s illiquid credit strategies in Europe.
Funds could be raised for European direct lending, mezzanine and special situations, he said.
“Institutional investors are quite interested in that opportunity set,” he said.
To fill these various pools of capital, KKR has been building its investor base. The firm grew its LP base to about 700 last year, up 23 percent from 2012, officials said on the call. One focus going forward is to try and “cross sell” the firm’s various strategies to LPs, who right now average about 1.6 KKR products per client, the firm said. 





KKR reported that fourth-quarter profit soared 127 percent, beating most analysts’ expectations.
The firm’s private equity assets appreciated 8.4 percent in the quarter.

	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS






	        This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, or the
	Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, which reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial
	performance. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "outlook," "believe," "expect," "potential," "continue," "may," "should," "seek," "approximately," "predict,"
	"intend," "will," "plan," "estimate," "anticipate," the negative version of these words, other comparable words or other statements that do not relate strictly to historical or factual matters.
	Without limiting the foregoing, statements regarding the expected acquisitions of KKR Financial Holdings LLC and Avoca Capital and the associated change in our distribution policy as well as
	statements regarding the impact of exits of investments on netting holes and future cash carry and distributions may constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to the risk that the terms
	of these transactions may be modified, the transactions may not be completed at all or the benefits and anticipated synergies from such transactions are not realized. Forward-looking statements are
	subject to various risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these
	statements. We believe these factors include those described under the section entitled "Risk Factors" in this report. These factors should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements
	that are included in this report and in our other
	periodic filings. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
















	        In
	this report, the term "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	        In
	this report, references to "KKR," "we," "us," "our" and "our partnership" refer to KKR & Co. L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Prior to
	KKR & Co. L.P. becoming listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on July 15, 2010, KKR Group Holdings L.P. ("Group Holdings") consolidated the financial
	results of KKR Management Holdings L.P. and KKR Fund Holdings L.P. (together, the "KKR Group Partnerships") and their consolidated subsidiaries. Each KKR Group Partnership has an
	identical number of partner interests and, when held together, one Class A partner interest in each of the KKR Group Partnerships together represents one KKR Group Partnership Unit.




	        References
	to "our Managing Partner" are to KKR Management LLC, which acts as our general partner and unless otherwise indicated, references to equity interests in KKR's business,
	or to percentage interests in KKR's business, reflect the aggregate equity of the KKR Group Partnerships and are net of amounts that have been allocated to our principals in respect of the carried
	interest from KKR's business as part of our "carry pool" and certain minority interests. References to our "principals" are to our senior employees and non-employee operating consultants who hold
	interests in KKR's business through KKR Holdings L.P., which we refer to as "KKR Holdings," and references to our "senior principals" are to principals who also hold interests in our Managing
	Partner entitling them to vote for the election of its directors.




	        Prior
	to October 1, 2009, KKR's business was conducted through multiple entities for which there was no single holding entity, but were under common control of senior KKR
	principals, and in which senior principals and KKR's other principals and individuals held ownership interests (collectively, the "Predecessor Owners"). On October 1, 2009, we completed the
	acquisition of all of the assets and liabilities of KKR & Co. (Guernsey) L.P. (f/k/a KKR Private Equity Investors, L.P. or "KPE") and, in connection with such acquisition,
	completed a series of transactions pursuant to which the business of KKR was reorganized into a holding company structure. The reorganization involved a contribution of certain equity interests in
	KKR's business that were held by KKR's Predecessor Owners to the KKR Group Partnerships in exchange for equity interests in the KKR Group Partnerships held through KKR




	3











	Table of Contents





	Holdings.
	We refer to the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of KPE and to our subsequent reorganization into a holding company structure as the "KPE Transaction."




	        In
	this report, the term "assets under management," or "AUM", represents the assets from which KKR is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest and general partner capital. We
	believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds. KKR calculates the amount of AUM
	as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds plus uncalled capital commitments from these funds; (ii) the fair value of investments in
	KKR's co-investment vehicles; (iii) the net asset value of certain of KKR's credit products; (iv) the value of outstanding structured finance vehicles; and (v) the fair value of
	other assets managed by KKR. KKR's definition of AUM is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages
	or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions.




	        In
	this report, the term "fee paying assets under management," or "FPAUM", represents only those assets under management from which KKR receives fees. We believe this measure is useful
	to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. This relates to KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment
	funds, for only those funds where KKR receives fees (i.e., excluding vehicles that receive only carried interest or general partner capital). FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases
	that are used to calculate KKR's fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets from which KKR does not receive a fee are excluded (i.e., assets with respect to which it
	receives only carried interest) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because
	fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments.




	        In
	this report, the term "fee related earnings," or "FRE", is comprised of segment fees less segment expenses (other than certain compensation and general and administrative expenses
	incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income). This measure is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating earnings of KKR and its business segments
	before investment income. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our fee generating management companies and capital
	markets businesses. The components of FRE on a segment basis differ from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a consolidated basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned from
	consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the
	amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations; (v) the exclusion of non-cash equity charges and other non-cash compensation charges
	borne by KKR Holdings or incurred under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan; (vi) the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses; and (vii) the exclusion
	of certain non-recurring items.




	        In
	this report, the term "economic net income (loss)," or "ENI", is a measure of profitability for KKR's reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative measurement of
	the operating and investment earnings of KKR and its business segments. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the overall profitability of KKR's
	businesses inclusive of investment income and carried interest. ENI is comprised of: (i) FRE plus (ii) segment investment income (loss), which is reduced for carry pool allocations,
	management fee refunds, interest expense and certain compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income; less
	(iii) certain economic interests in KKR's segments held by third parties. ENI differs from net income (loss) on a GAAP basis as a result of: (i) the exclusion of the items referred to in
	FRE above; (ii) the exclusion of investment income (loss) relating to noncontrolling interests; and (iii) the exclusion of income taxes.

	Table of Contents





	        In
	this report, "syndicated capital" is generally the aggregate amount of capital in transactions originated by KKR investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which has
	been distributed to third parties in exchange for a fee. It does not include (i) capital invested in such transactions by KKR investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which
	is instead reported in committed dollars invested and (ii) debt capital that is arranged as part of the acquisition financing of transactions originated by KKR investment funds. Syndicated
	capital is used as a measure of investment activity for KKR and its business segments during a given period, and we believe that this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight
	into levels of syndication activity in KKR's Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment and across its investment platform.




	        You
	should note that our calculations of AUM, FPAUM, FRE, ENI, syndicated capital and other financial measures may differ from the calculations of other investment managers and, as a
	result, our measurements of AUM, FPAUM, FRE, ENI, syndicated capital and other financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. For important
	information regarding these and other financial measures, please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of OperationsSegment Operating and
	Performance Measures."




	        References
	to "our funds" or "our vehicles" refer to investment funds, vehicles and/or accounts advised, sponsored or managed by one or more subsidiaries of KKR, unless context requires
	otherwise.




	        Unless
	otherwise indicated, references in this report to our fully exchanged and diluted common units outstanding, or to our common units outstanding on a fully exchanged and diluted
	basis, reflect (i) actual common units outstanding, (ii) common units into which KKR Group Partnership Units not held by us are exchangeable pursuant to the terms of the exchange
	agreement described in this report and (iii) common units issuable pursuant to any equity awards actually issued under the KKR & Co. L.P.
	2010 Equity Incentive Plan, which we refer to as our "Equity Incentive Plan," but do not reflect common units available for issuance pursuant to our Equity Incentive Plan for which grants have not yet
	been made.

	value in excess of $485 billion. In recent years, we have grown our firm by expanding our geographical presence and building businesses in new areas, such as credit, special situations, equity
	strategies, hedge fund solutions, capital markets, infrastructure, energy and real estate. Our new efforts build on our core principles and industry expertise, allowing us to leverage the intellectual
	capital and synergies in our businesses, and to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source. Additionally, we have increased our focus on meeting the needs of our existing fund
	investors and in developing relationships with new investors in our funds.




	        We
	conduct our business with offices throughout the world, providing us with a pre-eminent global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets
	activities. Our growth has been driven by value that we have created through our operationally focused investment approach, the expansion of our existing businesses, our entry into new lines of
	business, innovation in the products that we offer investors in our funds, an increased focus on providing tailored solutions to our clients and the integration of capital markets distribution
	activities.




	        As
	a global investment firm, we earn management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees for providing investment management, monitoring and other services to our funds, vehicles,
	managed accounts, specialty finance company and portfolio companies, and we generate transaction-specific income from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income from investing
	our own capital alongside that of our fund investors and from other principal investments and from the carried interest we receive from our funds and certain of our other investment vehicles. A
	carried interest entitles the sponsor of a fund to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested.




	        We
	seek to consistently generate attractive investment returns by employing world-class people, following a patient and disciplined investment approach and driving growth and value
	creation in the assets we manage. Our investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are supported by a substantial and diversified capital base, an integrated global investment platform, the
	expertise of
	operating consultants and senior advisors and a worldwide network of business relationships that provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence
	and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. We believe that these aspects of our business will help us continue to expand and grow our business and deliver strong
	investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions.












	Our Firm






	        With offices around the world, we have established ourselves as a leading global investment firm. We have multilingual and
	multicultural investment teams with local market knowledge and significant

	Table of Contents





	business,
	investment, and operational experience in the countries in which we invest. We believe that our global capabilities have helped us to raise capital, capture a greater number of investment
	opportunities, and assist our portfolio companies in their increasing reliance on global markets and sourcing, while enabling us to diversify our operations.




	        Though
	our operations span multiple continents and asset classes, our investment professionals are supported by an integrated infrastructure and operate under a common set of principles
	and business practices that are monitored by a variety of committees. The firm operates with a single culture that rewards investment discipline, creativity, determination, and patience and the
	sharing of information, resources, expertise, and best practices across offices and asset classes. When appropriate, we staff transactions across multiple offices and businesses in order to take
	advantage of the industry-specific expertise of our investment professionals, and we hold regular meetings in which investment professionals throughout our offices share their knowledge and
	experiences. We believe that the ability to draw on the local cultural fluency of our investment professionals while maintaining a centralized and integrated global infrastructure distinguishes us
	from other investment firms and has been a substantial contributing factor to our ability to raise funds, invest internationally and expand our businesses.




	        Since
	our inception, one of our fundamental philosophies has been to align the interests of the firm and our principals with the interests of our fund investors, portfolio companies and
	other stakeholders. We achieve this by putting our own capital behind our ideas. As of December 31, 2013, we and our principals have over $7.3 billion invested in or committed to our own
	funds and portfolio companies, including $4.2 billion funded through our balance sheet, $1.2 billion of additional commitments from our
	balance sheet to investment funds, $1.4 billion in personal investments and $0.5 billion of additional commitments from personal investments.












	Our Segments







	Private Markets





	        Through our Private Markets segment, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity funds and co-investment vehicles that invest
	capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. We also manage and sponsor a group of funds and co-investment vehicles that
	invest capital in real assets, such as infrastructure, energy and real estate. These funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC
	registered investment adviser. As of December 31, 2013, the segment had $61.2 billion of AUM and our actively investing funds are geographically differentiated. As of December 31,
	2013, Private Markets FPAUM was $50.2 billion, consisting of $44.6 billion in private equity and $5.6 billion of FPAUM in real assets (including infrastructure, energy and real
	estate). Prior to 2010, FPAUM in the Private Markets segment consisted entirely of private equity funds.

	As
	of December 31, 2013, we had $0.7 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan and
	approximately $2.2 billion in connection with other infrastructure, energy and other private equity funds and co-investment vehicles, which are not reflected in the table above. Such
	commitments will not contribute to AUM until we are entitled to receive fees or a carried interest in accordance with our definition of AUM and consequently are not included in AUM as of
	December 31, 2013.

	The
	commencement date represents the date on which the general partner of the applicable fund commenced investment of the fund's capital or the date of the
	first closing. The end date represents the earlier of (i) the date on which the general partner of the applicable fund was or will be required by the fund's governing agreement to cease making
	investments on behalf of the fund, unless extended by a vote of the fund investors, or (ii) the date on which the last investment was made.






	(2)




	The
	commitment represents the aggregate capital commitments to the fund, including capital commitments by third-party fund investors and the general
	partner. Foreign currency commitments have been converted into U.S. dollars based on (i) the foreign exchange rate at the date of purchase for each investment and (ii) the exchange rate
	that prevailed on December 31, 2013, in the case of unfunded commitments.






	(3)




	The
	remaining cost represents the initial investment of the general partner and limited partner, with the limited partner's investment reduced for any
	return of capital and realized gains from which the general partner did not receive a carried interest.







	Performance





	        We take a long-term approach to Private Markets investing and measure the success of our investments over a period of years rather than
	months. Given the duration of these investments, the firm focuses on realized multiples of invested capital and IRRs when deploying capital in these transactions. We have more than doubled the value
	of capital that we have invested in our Private Markets investment funds, turning $61.3 billion of capital into $126.5 billion of value from our inception in 1976 to December 31,
	2013. The value of capital that we have invested in our Private Markets investment funds and that has been realized and partially realized has grown from $33.5 billion to $95.6 billion.

	        From
	our inception in 1976 through December 31, 2013, our investment funds with at least 36 months of investment activity generated a cumulative gross IRR of 25.7%,
	compared to the 11.9% and 9.3% gross IRR achieved by the S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index, respectively, over the same period, despite the cyclical and sometimes challenging environments in
	which we have operated. The S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index are unmanaged indices and our returns assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect any fees or expenses. Such past
	performance, however, may not be representative of performance in any given period. For example, as of March 31, 2009, the date of the lowest aggregate valuation of our private equity funds
	during the most recent downturn, the investments in certain of our private equity funds at the time were marked down to 67% of original cost. For additional information regarding impact of market
	conditions on the value and performance of our investments, see "Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our BusinessDifficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in
	many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact
	our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition." and "Risks Related to the Assets We ManageThe historical returns attributable to our funds,
	including those presented in this report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns on our common units."




	        The
	tables below present information as of December 31, 2013 relating to the historical performance of certain of our Private Markets investment vehicles since inception, which we
	believe illustrates the benefits of our investment approach. The information presented under Total Investments includes all of the investments made by the specified investment vehicle, while the
	information presented under Realized/Partially Realized Investments includes only those investments for which realized proceeds, excluding current income like dividends and interest, are a material
	portion of invested capital. This data does not reflect additional capital raised since December 31, 2013 or

	The
	capital commitments of the European Fund, European Fund II, European Fund III and E2 Investors (Annex Fund) include euro-denominated commitments of
	€196.5 million, €2,597.5 million, €2,882.8 million and €55.5 million, respectively. Such amounts have been
	converted into U.S. dollars based on (i) the foreign exchange rate at the date of purchase for each investment and (ii) the exchange rate prevailing on December 31, 2013 in the
	case of unfunded commitments.

	The
	gross IRR, net IRR and multiple of invested capital are calculated for our investment funds that have invested for at least 36 months prior to
	December 31, 2013. None of the Infrastructure Fund, North America Fund XI, Asian Fund II, Real Estate Partners Americas or Energy Income and Growth Fund have invested for at least
	36 months as of December 31, 2013. We therefore have not calculated gross IRRs, net IRRs and multiples of invested capital with respect to those funds.

	Investments
	are considered partially realized when realized proceeds, excluding current income like dividends and interest, are a material portion of

	IRRs
	measure the aggregate annual compounded returns generated by a fund's investments over a holding period. Net IRRs presented under Total Investments are
	calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees. Net IRRs presented under Realized/Partially Realized
	Investments are calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest, but before payment of any applicable management fees as management fees are applied to
	funds, not investments. Gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to the allocation of carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees.






	**




	The
	multiples of invested capital measure the aggregate returns generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each multiple of invested capital is
	calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the fund. Such amounts do not give effect to the
	allocation of any realized and unrealized returns on a fund's investments to the fund's general partner pursuant to a carried interest or the payment of any applicable management fees.






	        For
	more information, see "Risk FactorsRisks Related to the Assets We ManageThe historical returns attributable to our funds, including those presented in this
	report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns on our common units."






	Private Equity






	        We are a world leader in private equity, having raised 18 funds with approximately $74.9 billion of capital commitments through
	December 31, 2013. We invest in industry-leading franchises and attract world-class management teams. Our investment approach leverages our capital base, sourcing advantage, global network and
	industry knowledge. It also leverages our sizeable team of operating consultants, who work exclusively with our investment professionals and portfolio company management teams and otherwise at our
	direction, as well as our senior advisors, many of whom are former chief executive officers and leaders of the business community.





	Portfolio





	        The following chart presents information concerning the amount of capital invested by private equity funds by geography through
	December 31, 2013. We believe that this data illustrates the benefits of our business approach and our ability to source and invest in deals in multiple geographies.

	as of December 31, 2013)













	        Our
	current private equity portfolio consists of over 85 companies with more than $200 billion of annual revenues. These companies are headquartered in 19 countries and operate in
	15 general industries which take advantage of our broad and deep industry and operating expertise. Many of these
	companies are leading franchises with global operations, strong management teams and attractive growth prospects, which we believe will provide benefits through a broad range of business conditions.

	Investment Approach





	        Our approach to making private equity investments focuses on achieving multiples of invested capital and attractive risk-adjusted IRRs
	by selecting high-quality investments that may be made at attractive prices, applying rigorous standards of due diligence when making investment decisions, implementing strategic and operational
	changes that drive growth and value creation in acquired businesses, carefully monitoring investments, and making informed decisions when developing investment exit strategies.




	        We
	believe that we have achieved a leading position in the private equity industry by applying a disciplined investment approach and by building strong partnerships with highly motivated
	management teams who put their own capital at risk. When making private equity investments, we seek out strong business franchises, attractive growth prospects, leading market positions, and the
	ability to generate attractive returns. In our private equity funds, we do not effect transactions that are "hostile", meaning a target company's board of directors makes an unfavorable recommendation
	with respect to the transaction or publicly opposes the consummation of the transaction.





	Sourcing and Selecting Investments





	        We have access to significant opportunities for making private equity investments as a result of our sizeable capital base, global
	platform, and relationships with leading executives from major companies, commercial and investment banks, and other investment and advisory institutions. Members of our global network contact us with
	new investment opportunities, including a substantial number of exclusive investment opportunities and opportunities that are made available to only a limited number of other firms. We also
	proactively pursue business development strategies that are designed to generate deals internally based on the depth of our industry knowledge and our reputation as a leading financial sponsor.




	        To
	enhance our ability to identify and consummate private equity investments, we have organized our investment professionals in industry-specific teams. Our industry teams work closely
	with our operating consultants and senior advisors to identify businesses that can be grown and improved. These teams conduct their own primary research, develop a list of industry themes and trends,
	identify companies and assets in need of operational improvement, and seek out businesses and assets that they believe will benefit from our involvement. They possess a detailed understanding of the
	economic drivers, opportunities for value creation, and strategies that can be designed and implemented to improve companies across the industries in which we invest.





	Due Diligence and the Investment Decision





	        When an investment team determines that an investment proposal is worth consideration, the proposal is formally presented to the
	applicable regional investment committee and the due diligence process commences if appropriate. The objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on
	the facts and circumstances surrounding an investment and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational improvement and value creation. When conducting
	due diligence, investment teams evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental, social, governance, legal and regulatory issues in order to determine whether an
	investment is suitable. While the due diligence process differs depending on the type of investment we make, generally, in connection with the private equity due diligence process, investment
	professionals spend significant amounts of time meeting with a company's management and operating personnel, visiting plants and facilities, and where appropriate, speaking with other stakeholders
	interested in and impacted by the investment in order to understand the opportunities and risks associated with the proposed investment. Our investment professionals may also use the services of
	outside accountants, consultants, lawyers, investment banks, and industry experts as




	14











	Table of Contents





	appropriate
	to assist them in this process. Investment committees monitor all due diligence practices, and the applicable investment committee must approve an investment before it may be made.





	Building Successful and Competitive Businesses





	        Portfolio management committees are responsible for working with our investment professionals from the date on which a private equity
	investment is made until the time it is exited in order to ensure that strategic and operational objectives are accomplished and that the performance of the investment is closely monitored. When
	investing in a private equity portfolio company, we partner with management teams to execute on our investment thesis, and we rigorously track performance through regular monitoring of detailed
	operational and financial metrics as well as appropriate environmental, social and governance issues. We have developed a global network of experienced managers and operating executives who assist the
	private equity portfolio companies in making operational improvements and achieving growth. We augment these resources with operational guidance from operating consultants at KKR Capstone, senior
	advisors, and investment teams, and with "100-Day Plans" that focus the firm's efforts and drive our strategies. We seek to emphasize efficient capital management, top-line growth, R&D spending,
	geographical expansion, cost optimization, and investment for the long-term.





	Realizing Investments





	        We have developed substantial expertise for realizing private equity investments. From our inception through December 31, 2013,
	the firm has generated approximately $87.8 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our private equity portfolio companies in initial public offerings and secondary offerings, dividends, and
	sales to strategic buyers. When exiting private equity investments, our objective is to structure the exit in a manner that optimizes returns for fund investors and, in the case of publicly traded
	companies, minimizes the impact that the exit has on the trading price of the company's securities. We believe that our ability to successfully realize investments is attributable in part to the
	strength and discipline of our portfolio management committees and capital markets business, as well as the firm's longstanding relationships with corporate buyers and members of the investment
	banking and investing communities.





	Private Equity Fund Structures





	        The private equity funds that we sponsor and manage have finite lives and investment periods. Each fund is organized as a single
	partnership or a combination of separate domestic and overseas partnerships, and each partnership is controlled by a general partner. Private equity fund investors are limited partners who agree to
	contribute a specified amount of capital to the fund from time to time for use in qualifying investments during the investment period, which generally lasts up to six years depending on how quickly
	capital is deployed. The investment period for certain funds may be terminated upon supermajority vote (based on capital commitment) of the fund's limited partners or by the fund's advisory committee.
	The term of our private equity funds generally end 10 to 12 years from the date of the fund's first or last investment, subject to a limited number of extensions with the consent of the limited
	partners or the applicable advisory committee. Given the length of the investment periods and terms of our private equity funds and the limited conditions under which such periods can be terminated
	and commitments may be withdrawn, the AUM of our private equity funds provide a long-term stable capital base.




	        Each
	private equity fund's general partner is generally entitled to a carried interest that allocates to it 20% of the net profits realized by the limited partners from the fund's
	investments. Our newest private equity funds, the North America Fund XI and our Asian Fund II have a performance hurdle which requires that we return 7%, compounded annually, to limited partners in
	the fund prior to receiving our 20% share of net profits realized by limited partners. Such performance hurdles are




	15











	Table of Contents





	subject
	to a catch-up allocation to the general partner after the hurdle has been reached. Our earlier private equity funds do not include a performance hurdle. The timing of receipt of carried
	interest in respect of investments of our carry funds is dictated by the terms of the partnership agreements that govern such funds, and is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund
	only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall
	investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund
	investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, but has one or more investments where fair value is
	below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a "netting hole." See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	OperationsLiquiditySources of Liquidity" for a discussion of netting holes. Net realized profit or loss is not netted between or among funds except for the Annex Fund as
	discussed below under "Other Private Equity Investment VehiclesE2 Investors (Annex Fund)". In addition, the agreements governing KKR's private equity funds generally include
	a "clawback" or, in certain instances, a "net loss sharing" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return or contribute amounts
	to the fund for distribution to fund investors at the end of the
	life of the fund. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting PoliciesClawback Provision", "Management's
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial ConditionCritical Accounting PoliciesNet Loss Sharing Provision" and "Risk FactorsThe "clawback" or "net loss sharing"
	provisions in our governing agreements may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require us to return or contribute amounts to our funds and fund investors."




	        We
	enter into management agreements with our private equity funds pursuant to which we receive management fees in exchange for providing the funds with management and other services.
	Gross management fees for our private equity funds generally range from 1% to 2% of committed capital during the fund's investment period and is generally 0.75% of invested capital after the
	expiration of the fund's investment period with subsequent reductions over time, which causes the fees to be reduced as investments are liquidated. These management fees are paid by private equity
	fund investors, who generally contribute capital to the fund in order to allow the fund to pay the fees to us. Our private equity funds generally require that management fees be returned to fund
	investors before a carried interest may be paid.




	        We
	also enter into monitoring agreements with our portfolio companies pursuant to which we receive periodic monitoring fees in exchange for providing them with management, consulting,
	and other services, and we typically receive transaction fees for providing portfolio companies with financial, advisory and other services in connection with specific transactions. In some cases, we
	may be entitled to other fees that are paid by an investment target upon closing a transaction or when a potential investment is not consummated. Our private equity fund agreements typically require
	us to share 80% to 100% of any monitoring, transaction and other fees that are allocable to a fund (after reduction for expenses incurred allocable to a fund from unconsummated transactions) with fund
	investors.




	        In
	addition, the agreements governing our private equity funds enable investors in those funds to reduce their capital commitments available for further investments, on an
	investor-by-investor basis, in the event certain "key persons" (for example, both of Messrs. Kravis and Roberts, and, in the case of certain geographically or product focused funds, one or more
	of the investment professionals focused on such funds) cease to be actively involved in the management of the fund. While these provisions do not allow investors in our funds to withdraw capital that
	has been invested or cause a fund to terminate, the occurrence of a "key man" event could cause disruption in our business, reduce the amount of capital that we have available for future investments,
	and make it more challenging to raise additional capital in the future.

	        To
	the extent investors in our private equity funds suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, fund investors may have remedies
	against us, our private equity funds, our principals, or our affiliates under the federal securities laws and state laws.
	While the general partners and investment advisers to our private equity funds, including their directors, officers, other employees, and affiliates, are generally indemnified by the private equity
	funds to the fullest extent permitted by law with respect to their conduct in connection with the management of the business and affairs of our private equity funds, such indemnity does not extend to
	actions determined to have involved fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct.




	        Because
	private equity fund investors typically are unwilling to invest their capital in a fund unless the fund's manager also invests its own capital in the fund's investments, our
	private equity fund documents generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to the funds. The amounts of these commitments, which are negotiated by fund
	investors, generally range from 2% to 4% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds pursuing newer strategies. When investments are made, the general
	partner contributes capital to the fund based on its fund commitment percentage and acquires a capital interest in the investment that is not subject to a carried interest or management fees. Prior to
	the KPE Transaction, these capital contributions were funded with cash from operations that otherwise would be distributed to our principals. Subsequent to the KPE Transaction, these general partner
	commitments are made through our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment.





	Other Private Equity Investment Vehicles






	        E2 Investors (Annex Fund).



	    We established the Annex Fund in 2009 to enable fund investors in the European Fund II and the Millennium
	Fund to make
	additional investments in portfolio companies of the European Fund II, which had already been fully invested. This fund has several features that distinguish it from our other private equity funds,
	including: (i) it does not pay a management fee to us; (ii) its general partner is only entitled to a carried interest after netting any losses, costs, and expenses relating to European
	Fund II and certain Millennium Fund investments from the profits of the Annex Fund investments; and (iii) no transaction or incremental monitoring fees are charged in connection with
	investments in which the Annex Fund participates. The Annex Fund reached the end of its investment period in November 2013.





	        Other Private Equity Products.



	    We have offered significant co-investment opportunities to both fund investors and other third parties.
	We have built
	out our capital markets and distribution capabilities and created new investment structures and products that allow us to syndicate a portion of the equity needed to finance acquisitions. These
	structures include co-investment vehicles and a principal-protected private equity product, which generally entitles the firm to receive management fees and/or a carried interest. In addition, we
	manage certain separately managed accounts in the form of separate investment vehicles based on terms that are separately negotiated with investors in those
	vehicles. We have also launched multi-strategy products, which invest in our funds, co-investment vehicles and external funds. As of December 31, 2013, we had $4.6 billion of AUM in
	these other private equity products.






	Real Assets







	Energy





	        We manage investments in energy assets, such as oil and natural gas properties. In 2010 we launched our first dedicated energy fund,
	the KKR Natural Resources Fund, which seeks to acquire and operate oil and natural gas properties in mature basins located primarily in the United States. In acquiring these properties, which are
	typically considered to be non-core by their sellers, we seek to generate value through optimizing production around the acquired properties (via workovers and other




	17











	Table of Contents





	operational
	initiatives), reducing operating costs, and optimizing commercial and marketing arrangements.




	        Since
	the launch of the KKR Natural Resources Fund, we have invested in our capabilities, both with respect to our team of investment professionals and our relationships with technical
	partners. With these capabilities, we have expanded our energy strategy to target real asset investment opportunities across the upstream and midstream segments of the oil and gas industry. As part of
	this effort, we have completed investments in oil and gas drilling development transactions with operating companies and have also acquired mineral and royalty interests. We invest in various of these
	energy strategies through our newest energy fund, the KKR Energy Income and Growth Fund. As of December 31, 2013, we have received $2,289.6 million of capital commitments to our energy
	funds and $861.0 million of capital commitments to this strategy through separately managed accounts.




	        Our
	energy business aims to deliver current returns to fund investors through distributions generated by producing and selling the oil and natural gas reserves of these acquired
	properties and providing fund investors with exposure to commodity prices and the optionality of future drilling and production. We work closely with external teams of technical and operational
	experts to assist in the selection, evaluation and operation of investments.





	Infrastructure





	        We manage investments in infrastructure assets in order to capitalize on the growing demand for global infrastructure investment, and
	began investing through our first dedicated infrastructure fund, KKR Global Infrastructure Investors L.P., in 2011. We believe that the global infrastructure market provides an opportunity for
	the firm's combination of private investment, operational improvement and stakeholder engagement skills. This strategy seeks to achieve returns including current income through the acquisition and
	operational improvement of assets important to the functioning of the economy. Through this strategy we have made investments in parking, alternative energy, district heating and contracted
	electricity generation, water and wastewater and telecommunications infrastructure. As of December 31, 2013, we had received $1,042.4 million of capital commitments to our Infrastructure
	Fund and $1,356.0 million of capital commitments to this strategy through co-investment vehicles.





	Real Estate





	        We have hired several experienced real estate investment executives since 2011, who have helped the firm develop a dedicated real
	estate strategy. Committing our own seed capital to develop this strategy, we launched our first dedicated real estate fund, KKR Real Estate Partners Americas, in 2013. In addition, we have the
	flexibility to invest in real estate transactions across the capital structure through various vehicles, including our private equity and alternative credit funds. This platform targets real estate
	opportunities, including direct investments in real property, debt, special situations transactions and businesses with significant real estate holdings that can benefit from KKR's operational
	expertise. We seek to partner with real estate owners, lenders, operators, and developers to provide flexible capital to respond to transaction specific needs, including the outright purchase or
	financing of existing assets or companies and the funding of future development or acquisition opportunities. Through this strategy, we have made real estate investments in residential and commercial
	assets. As of December 31, 2013, we have received $1.2 billion of capital commitments through our real estate fund.

	Table of Contents







	Real Asset Investment Process






	        Our energy, infrastructure and real estate funds have a similar investment process as that described under "Private
	Equity." Investment teams for a particular real asset strategy formally present investments to the applicable strategy oriented investment committee, which monitors all due diligence practices and
	must approve an investment before it may be made. Each of our real asset strategies also has a portfolio management committee that works with our investment professionals from the date on which an
	investment is made until the time it is exited in order to ensure that strategic and operational objectives are accomplished and that the performance of the investment is closely monitored. In
	addition to leveraging the resources of the firm, our energy and real estate investment teams partner with technical experts and operators to manage our real asset investments.






	Real Asset Fund Structures






	        Our energy, infrastructure and real estate funds have investment periods of up to 6 years and generally have a fund term of up
	to 13 years. Management fees for such funds range from 0.75% to 1.5% on commitments, invested capital or net asset value during the investment period and on unreturned contributions or net
	asset value for investments thereafter, subject to certain adjustments. These funds generally have performance hurdles of 8% to 10% subject to a catch-up allocation to the general partner after the
	hurdle has been reached. Thereafter the general partners of such funds share in 10% to 20% of net profits realized by limited partners.





	Public Markets





	        We operate our credit and hedge funds businesses through the Public Markets segment. Our credit business is managed by KKR Asset
	Management, LLC, or KAM, an SEC registered investment adviser. KAM advises funds, structured finance vehicles, separately managed accounts, business development companies ("BDCs") and other
	investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act") that invest capital in (i) leveraged credit strategies, such as leveraged loans and high
	yield bonds and (ii) alternative credit strategies such as mezzanine investments, special situations investments, direct lending investments and long/short credit. In addition, on
	February 19, 2014, KKR acquired Avoca Capital and its affiliates ("Avoca"), a leading European credit investment manager with approximately $8.4 billion in assets under management as of
	December 31, 2013.




	        In
	addition to our credit business, we have a hedge funds business that offers a variety of investment strategies and focuses on providing investment solutions for institutional
	investors. These strategies are managed by KAM and Prisma Capital Partners LP, or KKR Prisma, an SEC registered investment adviser. This business offers customized hedge fund portfolios, hedge
	fund-of-fund solutions and a long/short equity strategy. In addition, on January 23, 2013, we acquired a 24.9% interest in Nephila Capital Ltd. ("Nephila"), an investment manager focused
	on investing in natural catastrophe and weather risk.




	        We
	intend to continue to grow the Public Markets business by leveraging our global investment platform, experienced investment professionals and the ability to adapt our investment
	strategies to different market conditions to capitalize on investment opportunities that may arise at various levels of the capital structure and across market cycles.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013, this segment had $33.1 billion of AUM, comprised of $13.0 billion of assets managed in our leveraged credit strategies, $6.5 billion
	of assets managed in our alternative credit
	strategies, $2.3 billion of assets managed across a range of strategies through KFN, $10.1 billion of assets managed in our hedge fund solutions strategies, $0.4 billion of assets
	managed in our liquid long/short equity strategies and $0.8 billion of assets managed in other strategies. Our alternative credit investments include $1.8 billion of assets managed in
	our mezzanine strategy, $3.0 billion of assets

	managed
	in our special situations strategy, $1.5 billion of assets managed in our direct lending strategy and $0.2 billion of assets managed in our long/short credit strategy. The

	Credit







	Performance





	        We generally review our performance in our credit business by investment strategy. Our leveraged credit strategies invest in leveraged
	loans and high yield bonds, or a combination of both. In certain cases these strategies have meaningful track records and may be compared to widely-known indices. The following table presents
	information regarding larger leveraged
	credit strategies managed by KKR from inception to December 31, 2013. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

	The
	Benchmarks referred to herein include the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the "S&P/LSTA Loan Index") and the Bank of America Merrill Lynch High Yield
	Master II Index (the "BoAML HY Master II Index" and, together with the S&P/LSTA Loan Index, the "Indices"). The S&P/LSTA Loan Index is an index that comprises all loans that meet the inclusion
	criteria and that have marks from the LSTA/LPC mark-to-market service. The inclusion criteria consist of the following: (i) syndicated term loan instruments consisting of term loans (both
	amortizing and institutional), acquisition loans (after they are drawn down) and bridge loans; (ii) secured; (iii) U.S. dollar denominated; (iv) minimum term of one year at
	inception; and (v) minimum initial spread of LIBOR plus 1.25%. The BoAML HY Master II Index is a market value weighted index of below investment grade U.S. dollar denominated corporate bonds
	publicly issued in the U.S. domestic market. "Yankee" bonds (debt of foreign issuers issued in the U.S. domestic market) are included in the BoAML HY Master II Index provided that the issuer is
	domiciled in a country having investment grade foreign currency long-term debt rating. Qualifying bonds must have maturities of one year or more, a fixed coupon schedule and minimum outstanding of
	US$100 million. In addition, issuers having a credit rating lower than BBB3, but not in default, are also included. While the returns of KAM strategies reflect the reinvestment of income and
	dividends, none of the indices presented in the chart above reflect such reinvestment, which has the effect of increasing the reported relative performance of the KAM strategies as compared to the
	indices. Furthermore, these indices are not subject to management fees, incentive allocations or expenses. It is not possible to invest directly in unmanaged indices.

	The
	AUM of the Bank Loans Plus High Yield strategy is also included in the AUM of the High Yield strategy and the AUM of the Bank Loans strategy.

	Performance
	is based on a blended composite of Bank Loans Plus High Yield strategy accounts. The Benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Bank
	Loans Plus High Yield strategy is based on 65% S&P/LSTA Loan Index and 35% BoAML HY Master II Index.

	The
	Opportunistic Credit strategy invests in high yield securities and corporate loans with no preset allocation. The Benchmark used for purposes of
	comparison for the Opportunistic Credit strategy presented herein is based on the BoAML HY Master II Index.






	(5)




	Performance
	is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in leveraged loans. The Benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Bank Loans
	strategy is based on the S&P/LSTA Loan Index.






	(6)




	Performance
	is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in high yield securities. The Benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the High
	Yield strategy is based on the BoAML HY Master II Index.






	(7)




	Performance
	is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in leveraged loans rated B-/Baa3 or higher. The Benchmark used for purposes of
	comparison for the Bank Loans strategy is based on the S&P/LSTA BB/B Loan Index






	        Our
	alternative credit strategies primarily invest in more illiquid instruments through closed-end funds. The following table presents information regarding our Public Markets
	alternative credit vehicles that are the most similar to our Private Markets investment funds in terms of fee structure, commitment period and other terms, from inception to December 31, 2013.

	multiples of invested capital measure the aggregate returns generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each multiple of invested capital is
	calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the fund. Such amounts do not give effect to the
	allocation of any realized and unrealized returns on a fund's investments to the fund's general partner pursuant to a carried interest or the payment of any applicable management fees.






	        Such
	past performance may not be representative of performance in any given period. For additional information regarding impact of market conditions on the value and performance of our
	investments, see "Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our BusinessDifficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or
	performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely
	affect our financial condition." and "Risks Related to the Assets We ManageThe historical returns attributable to our funds, including those presented in this report, should
	not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns on our common units."





	Investment Approach





	        Our approach to making investments focuses on creating investment portfolios that seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by
	selecting investments that may be made at attractive prices, subjecting investments to regular monitoring and oversight, and, for more liquid investments, making buy and sell decisions based on price
	targets and relative value parameters. The firm employs both "top-down" and "bottom-up" analyses when making investments. Our top-down analysis involves, as appropriate, a macro analysis of relative
	asset valuations, long-term industry trends, business cycles, regulatory trends, interest rate expectations, credit fundamentals and technical factors to target specific industry sectors and asset
	classes in which to invest. From a bottom-up perspective, our investment decision is predicated on an investment thesis that is developed using our proprietary resources and knowledge and due
	diligence.





	Sourcing and Selecting Investments





	        We source investment opportunities through a variety of channels, including internal deal generation strategies and the firm's global
	network of contacts at major companies, corporate executives, commercial and investment banks, financial intermediaries, other private equity sponsors and other investment and advisory institutions.
	We are also provided with opportunities to invest in




	22











	Table of Contents





	certain
	strategies, where appropriate, in the securities of KKR's private equity portfolio companies, though there are limitations across the platform on the maximum size of such KKR-affiliated
	investments.





	Due Diligence and the Investment Decision





	        Once a potential investment has been identified, our investment professionals screen the opportunity and make a preliminary
	determination concerning whether we should proceed with further diligence. When evaluating the suitability of an investment for our funds,
	we employ a relative value framework and subject the investment to due diligence. This review considers, as appropriate, expected returns, capital structure, credit ratings, historical and projected
	financial data, the issuer's competitive position, the quality and track record of the issuer's management team, margin stability, and industry and company trends. Investment professionals use the
	services of outside advisors and industry experts as appropriate to assist them in the due diligence process and, when relevant and permitted, leverage the knowledge and experience of our Private
	Markets investment professionals. Strategy-specific investment committees monitor all due diligence practices.





	Monitoring Investments





	        We monitor our portfolios of investments using, as applicable, daily, quarterly and annual analyses. Daily analyses include morning
	market meetings, industry and company pricing runs, industry and company reports and discussions with the firm's private equity investment professionals on an as-needed basis. Quarterly analyses
	include the preparation of quarterly operating results, reconciliations of actual results to projections and updates to financial models (baseline and stress cases). Annual analyses involve conducting
	internal audits, and testing compliance with monitoring and documentation requirements.






	Credit Strategies and Vehicles







	KFN





	        KKR Financial Holdings LLC (NYSE: KFN), or KFN, is an NYSE-listed specialty finance company that commenced operations in July
	2004. Its majority-owned subsidiaries finance and invest in financial assets, including below investment grade corporate debt, marketable equity securities and private equity. Additionally, KFN,
	through its subsidiaries, has made additional investments in other asset classes including specialty lending, energy and real estate. Below investment grade debt includes senior secured and unsecured
	loans, mezzanine loans, high yield bonds, and distressed and stressed debt. KAM serves as the external manager of KFN under a management agreement and is entitled to receive a management fee and an
	incentive fee. Historically, KFN has formed a part of our Public Markets business. On December 16, 2013, we, certain of our affiliates and KFN entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which
	KFN would become a subsidiary of KKR. The completion of the merger is subject to various conditions, including, among others things, obtaining the requisite approval of KFN's shareholders.





	Credit Strategies





	        Our credit strategies business pursues investments in debt securities ranging from liquid securities such as leveraged loans and
	high-yield bonds to alternative credit including longer-duration strategies such as mezzanine, special situations and direct lending. These investments may be made across a range of vehicles including
	funds, single- or cross-strategy separately managed accounts and BDCs. These managed accounts enable us to tailor an investment program to meet the specific risk, return and investment objective of
	investors in our funds.




	23











	Table of Contents






	        Leveraged Credit.



	    Our leveraged credit strategies are directed at investing in leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, or a combination of
	both. They are
	pursued primarily through separately managed accounts and registered investment companies, with a smaller amount of capital residing in funds. We are entitled to receive a fee for managing these
	vehicles.





	        Structured Credit Vehicles.



	    Beginning in 2005, we began managing structured credit vehicles in the form of collateralized loan
	obligation
	transactions, or CLOs. CLOs are typically structured as bankruptcy-remote, special purpose investment vehicles which acquire, monitor and, to varying degrees, manage a pool of credit assets. KFN
	conducts a majority of its business through its holdings of a majority of the voting securities of, and certain other interests in, such CLOs. The CLOs serve as long term financing for credit
	investments and as a way to minimize refinancing risk, minimize maturity risk and secure a fixed cost of funds over an underlying market interest rate for KFN and other credit funds. We may receive a
	fee for managing certain CLOs.





	        Alternative Credit.



	    In the last several years, our Public Markets business has expanded to include adjacent investment strategies in
	alternative
	credit which leverage the knowledge and relationships developed in the leveraged credit business. These strategies include mezzanine, distressed or special situations investing, direct lending and
	long/short credit. As with our leveraged credit strategy, these are pursued through a combination of separately managed accounts, a BDC and funds. For managing these accounts and funds, we are
	entitled to receive either fees or a combination of fees and carried interest.






	        Direct Lending.    



	We manage investments in proprietarily sourced primarily senior debt financings for middle-market companies through
	our direct lending strategy. We
	closed our first dedicated direct lending fund, KKR Lending Partners L.P. in December 2012 and managed $1.5 billion of assets in this strategy as of December 31, 2013.





	        Mezzanine.    



	We manage mezzanine investments primarily through a fund that invests in directly sourced third-party mezzanine transactions.
	These investments often
	consist of mezzanine debt, which generates a current yield, coupled with marginal equity exposure with additional upside potential. We closed our first dedicated mezzanine fund, KKR Mezzanine
	Partners L.P. in August 2011 and managed $1.8 billion of assets in this strategy as of December 31, 2013.





	        Special Situations.    



	We seek to make opportunistic investments largely in distressed companies through our special situations
	investment strategy. These investments
	include secondary market distressed investments (including post-restructuring equity), control-oriented opportunities, rescue financing (debt or equity investments made to address covenant, maturity
	or liquidity issues), debtor-in-possession or exit financing, structured principal investments, and other event-driven investments in debt or equity. We closed our first dedicated special situations
	fund, KKR Special Situations Fund L.P., in December 2013 and managed $3.0 billion of assets in this strategy as of December 31, 2013.





	        Long/short credit.    



	In 2012 we launched our long/short credit strategy, which invests across capital structures with a focus primarily
	on corporate credit opportunities
	and managed $0.2 billion of assets in this strategy as of December 31, 2013.






	Products for Individual Investors





	        KKR Asset Management LLC serves as the registered investment adviser to investment companies registered under the Investment
	Company Act (or, in the case of the BDC we manage, as its sub-adviser), which are subject to the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder. The management fees we receive from these registered
	investment companies are generally paid on a regular basis (typically monthly) and proportionately increase or decrease based on the net asset value or gross assets of the investment company. The
	management fees we are paid for managing these




	24











	Table of Contents





	investment
	companies will generally be subject to contractual rights that require their board of directors to provide prior notice (or, in the case of the BDC we manage, the investment adviser) in
	order to terminate our investment management services.






	Hedge Funds







	Overview





	        Our hedge fund business is comprised of direct hedge funds, customized hedge fund solutions, and interests in other public markets
	businesses. We established our hedge fund business in 2011 with the hiring of a team of experienced public equity investment executives, who manage our long/short equity strategy. In October 2012 we
	further expanded our hedge fund business with the acquisition of Prisma Capital Partners LP ("KKR Prisma"), through which we provide customized hedge fund portfolio and hedge fund-of-fund
	solutions. In 2013, we further grew this business with the acquisition of a 24.9% interest in Nephila, an investment manager focused on investing in natural catastrophe and weather risk.





	KKR Prisma





	        KKR Prisma constructs and manages customized hedge fund portfolios and hedge fund-of-funds. It seeks to deliver superior performance by
	utilizing portfolio construction techniques and an integrated, quantitative approach to risk management. KKR Prisma takes a specialist approach by seeking leading niche hedge fund managers in each
	strategy. Various strategies are offered to investors, including moderate and low-volatility, equity, credit and opportunistic, in both commingled and separate account portfolios. For the year ended
	December 31, 2013, KKR Prisma's low volatility composite, consisting of all fee-paying accounts that it manages using a low volatility strategy, returned 12.0% gross of fees. As of
	December 31, 2013, KKR Prisma managed $10.1 billion of AUM.





	KKR Equity Strategies





	        KKR Equity Strategies pursues fundamental research driven long/short investments, primarily in liquid public equity securities of
	companies that are based in North America and Latin America. Launched in 2011, the team targets a low volatility and low net exposure approach. The team also utilizes proprietarily developed portfolio
	risk analytics that have an important role in informing the team's research, investment decision-making and monitoring processes. As of December 31, 2013, KKR Equity Strategies managed
	$0.4 billion of AUM.

	Capital Markets and Principal Activities





	        Our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment combines KKR's principal assets with our global capital markets business.




	        Our
	capital markets business employs approximately 45 executives and supports our firm, our portfolio companies and third-party clients by developing and implementing both traditional
	and non-traditional capital solutions for investments or companies seeking financing. These services include arranging debt and equity financing for transactions, placing and underwriting securities
	offerings and providing other types of capital markets services. When we underwrite an offering of securities or a loan on a firm commitment basis, we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities or
	indebtedness and generate revenue by purchasing the securities or indebtedness at a discount or for a fee. When we act in an agency capacity, we generate revenue for arranging financing or placing
	securities or debt with capital markets investors. To allow us to carry out these activities, we are registered or authorized to carry out certain broker-dealer activities in various countries in
	North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Our third party capital markets activities are generally carried out through Merchant Capital Solutions LLC, a joint venture with two
	other unaffiliated partners, and non-bank financial companies, or NBFCs, in India.

	        KKR's
	principal assets, which include investments in our investment funds and co-investments in certain portfolio companies of such funds, provide us with a significant source of capital
	to further grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our existing portfolio of businesses and further align our interests with those of our fund investors and other stakeholders. The
	majority of our principal assets consist of general partner interests in KKR investment funds, limited partner interests in certain KKR private equity funds, co-investments in certain portfolio
	companies of such private equity funds, and other assets we acquired in the KPE Transaction, with the remaining holdings consisting of assets held in the development of our business, including seed
	capital for new strategies and other opportunistic investments. We believe that the market experience and skills of professionals in our capital markets business and the investment expertise of
	professionals in our Private Markets and Public Markets segments will allow us to continue to grow and diversify this asset base over time.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013, the segment had $5.0 billion of investments at fair value. The following charts present information concerning our principal assets by type as of
	December 31, 2013.





	Investments by Type













	Client & Partner Group





	        We have a Client & Partner Group that is responsible for raising capital for us globally across all products, expanding our
	client relationships across asset classes and across types of fund investors, developing products to meet our clients' needs, and servicing existing fund investors and products. We also provide
	fundraising services to Nephila. As of December 31, 2013, we had 74 executives and professionals dedicated to our Client & Partner Group.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 700 investors in funds across all our strategies, which reflects the addition of approximately 120 investors during the year. On
	average, a fund investor

	Competition





	        We compete with other investment managers for both fund investors and investment opportunities. The firm's competitors consist
	primarily of sponsors of public and private investment funds, real estate development companies, business development companies, investment banks, commercial finance companies and operating companies
	acting as strategic buyers. We believe that competition for fund investors is based primarily on investment performance, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, investor perception of investment
	managers' drive, focus and alignment of interest, business reputation, duration of relationships, quality of services, pricing, fund terms including fees, and the relative attractiveness of the types
	of investments that have been or are to be made. We believe that competition for investment opportunities is based primarily on the pricing, terms and structure of a proposed investment and certainty
	of execution. In addition to these traditional competitors within the global investment management industry, we also face competition from local and regional firms, financial institutions and
	sovereign wealth funds, in the various countries in which we invest. In certain emerging markets, local firms may have more established relationships with the companies in which we are attempting to
	invest. These competitors often fall into one of the aforementioned categories but in some cases may represent new types of fund investors, including high net worth individuals, family offices and
	state- sponsored entities.




	        There
	are numerous funds focused on private equity, real assets, credit and hedge fund strategies that compete for investor capital. Fund managers have also increasingly adopted
	investment strategies outside of their traditional focus. For example, funds focused on credit and equity strategies have become active in taking control positions in companies, while private equity
	funds have acquired minority and/or debt positions in publicly listed companies. This convergence could heighten competition for investments. Furthermore, as institutional fund investors increasingly
	consolidate their relationships for multiple investment products with a few investment firms, competition for capital from such institutional fund investors may become more acute.




	        Some
	of the entities that we compete with as an investment firm may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than us and, in the case of some
	asset classes, longer operating histories, more established relationships or greater experience. Several of our

	Table of Contents





	competitors
	also have raised, or may raise, significant amounts of capital and have investment objectives that are similar to the investment objectives of our funds, which may create additional
	competition for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have lower costs of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive
	advantages for them. For example, master limited partnerships, or MLPs, which typically invest in oil and gas assets, may have a lower cost of capital than, and may compete with our energy funds for
	investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider
	range of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments. Strategic buyers may also be able to achieve synergistic cost savings or revenue enhancements with respect to a targeted
	portfolio company, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for such investments.




	        We
	expect to compete as a capital markets business primarily with investment banks and independent broker-dealers in the North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. We
	principally focus our capital markets activities on the firm, our portfolio companies and fund investors, but we also seek to service other third parties, principally through Merchant Capital
	Solutions LLC. While we generally target customers with whom we have existing relationships, those customers may have similar relationships with the firm's competitors, many of whom will have
	access to competing securities transactions, greater financial, technical or marketing resources or more established reputations than us. The limited operating history of our capital markets business
	could make it difficult for us to compete with established investment banks or broker-dealers, participate in capital markets transactions of issuers or successfully grow the firm's capital markets
	business over time.




	        Competition
	is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees and consultants. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our
	ability to attract new employees and consultants and retain and motivate our existing employees and consultants.







	Employees, Consultants and Advisors

	assets and include executives with operations, strategic consulting, risk management, liability management and finance experience. As a group, these professionals provide us with a strong global team

	Table of Contents






	Other Professionals





	        Our 472 other professionals come from diverse backgrounds in capital markets, capital raising, client servicing, public affairs,
	finance, tax, legal, human resources, and information technology. As a group, these professionals provide us with a strong team for overseeing investments and performing capital markets activities,
	servicing our existing fund investors and creating relationships with new fund investors globally. Additionally, a majority of these other professionals are responsible for supporting the global
	infrastructure of KKR.





	KKR Capstone





	        We have developed an institutionalized process for creating value in investments. As part of our effort, we utilize a team of 53
	operating consultants at KKR Capstone, who work exclusively with our investment professionals and portfolio company management teams and otherwise at our direction. With professionals in North
	America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific, KKR
	Capstone provides additional expertise for assessing investment opportunities and assisting managers of portfolio companies in defining strategic priorities and implementing operational changes.
	During the initial phases of an investment, KKR Capstone's work seeks to implement our thesis for value creation. Our operating consultants may assist portfolio companies in addressing top-line
	growth, cost optimization and efficient capital allocation and in developing operating and financial metrics. Over time, this work shifts to identifying challenges and taking advantage of business
	opportunities that arise during the life of an investment.





	Senior Advisors





	        To complement the expertise of our investment professionals, we have a team of 38 senior advisors to provide us with additional
	operational and strategic insights. The responsibilities of senior advisors include serving on the boards of our portfolio companies, helping us source and evaluate individual investment opportunities
	and assisting portfolio companies with operational matters. These individuals include former chief executive officers, chief financial officers and chairmen of Fortune 500 companies, as well as other
	individuals who have held leading positions in major corporations and public agencies worldwide.

	Organizational Structure





	        The following simplified diagram illustrates our organizational structure as of December 31, 2013, unless otherwise noted.
	Certain entities depicted below may be held through intervening entities not shown in the diagram.














	(1)




	KKR
	Management LLC serves as the general partner of KKR & Co. L.P., which is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of a
	majority of independent directors. KKR Management LLC does not hold any economic interests in KKR & Co. L.P. and is owned by senior KKR principals.






	(2)




	KKR
	Holdings is the holding vehicle through which certain of our current and former principals indirectly own their interest in KKR. KKR Group Partnership
	Units that are held by KKR Holdings are exchangeable for our common units on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications
	and compliance with applicable vesting and transfer restrictions. As limited partner interests, these KKR Group Partnership Units are non-voting and do not entitle KKR Holdings to participate in the
	management of our business and affairs. As of December 31, 2013, KKR Holdings had a 58.4% interest in our business indirectly through its limited partner interests in the KKR Group
	Partnerships.






	(3)




	KKR
	Holdings holds special non-economic voting units in our partnership that entitle it to cast, with respect to those limited matters that may be submitted
	to a vote of our unitholders, a number of votes equal to the number of KKR Group Partnership Units that it holds from time to time.






	(4)




	KKR
	Group Finance Co. LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of KKR Management Holdings Corp. and the issuer of our $500 million aggregate
	principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "2020 Senior Notes"). The 2020 Senior Notes are guaranteed by KKR & Co. L.P. and the KKR Group Partnerships.






	(5)




	KKR
	Group Finance Co. II LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of KKR Management Holdings Corp. and the issuer of our $500 million aggregate
	principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes due

	2043
	(the "2043 Senior Notes"), which were issued on February 1, 2013. The 2043 Senior Notes are guaranteed by KKR & Co. L.P. and the KKR Group Partnerships.






	(6)




	Because
	the income of KKR Management Holdings L.P. is likely to be primarily non-qualifying income for purposes of the qualifying income exception to
	the publicly traded partnership rules, we formed KKR Management Holdings Corp., which is subject to taxation as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to hold our KKR Group
	Partnership Units in KKR Management Holdings L.P. Accordingly, our allocable share of the taxable income of KKR Management Holdings L.P. will be subject to taxation at a corporate rate.
	KKR Management Holdings L.P., which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, was formed to hold interests in our fee generating businesses and other assets that may not
	generate qualifying income for purposes of the qualifying income exception to the publicly traded partnership rules. KKR Fund Holdings L.P., which is also treated as a partnership for
	U.S. federal income tax purposes, was formed to hold interests in our businesses and assets that will generate qualifying income for purposes of the qualifying income exception to the publicly traded
	partnership rules.






	(7)




	KKR
	Management Holdings L.P. is the parent company of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., the SEC-registered investment adviser,
	which in turn is generally the parent company for KKR's other management and capital markets subsidiaries including KKR Asset Management LLC, Prisma Capital Partners LP and KKR Capital
	Markets Holdings L.P., the holding company for KKR Capital Markets LLC. KKR Fund Holdings L.P. is the parent company of Avoca.

	40%
	of the carried interest earned in relation to our investment funds and carry paying co-investment vehicles is allocated to a carry pool from which
	carried interest is allocated to our principals, other professionals and selected other individuals who work in these operations. No carried interest has been allocated with respect to co-investments
	acquired from KPE in the KPE Transaction.






	Regulation





	        Our operations are subject to regulation and supervision in a number of jurisdictions. The level of regulation and supervision to which
	we are subject varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activity involved. We, in conjunction with our outside advisors and counsel, seek to manage our business
	and operations in compliance with such regulation and supervision. The regulatory and legal requirements that apply to our activities are subject to change from time to time and may become more
	restrictive, which may make compliance with applicable requirements more difficult or expensive or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct our business activities in the manner in which they are now
	conducted. Changes in applicable regulatory and legal requirements, including changes in their enforcement, could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results
	of operations. As a matter of public policy, the regulatory bodies that regulate our business activities are generally responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and financial
	markets and protecting fund investors who participate in those markets rather than protecting the interests of our unitholders.






	United States







	Regulation as an Investment Adviser





	        We conduct our advisory business through our investment adviser subsidiaries, including Kohlberg Kravis
	Roberts & Co. L.P. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries KKR Asset Management LLC and Prisma Capital Partners LP, each of which is registered as an investment adviser
	with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. The investment advisers are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions
	which apply to our relationships with our advisory clients globally, including funds that we manage. These provisions and




	32











	Table of Contents





	duties
	impose restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our fund investors and our investments, including for example restrictions on agency cross and principal
	transactions. Our registered investment advisers are subject to periodic SEC examinations and other requirements under the Investment Advisers Act and related regulations primarily intended to benefit
	advisory clients. These additional requirements relate, among other things, to maintaining an effective and comprehensive compliance program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements and disclosure
	requirements. The Investment Advisers Act generally grants the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting advisory activities in
	the event it fails to comply with federal securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements include the prohibition of individuals from
	associating with an investment adviser, the revocation of registrations and other censures and fines.




	        KKR
	Asset Management is subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act as an investment adviser to registered investment companies. The KKR Income Opportunities Fund is a
	closed-end management investment company, and KKR Series Trust is an open-end management investment company, registered under the Investment Company Act. The open-end management investment company,
	the closed-end management company and KKR Asset Management are subject to the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder, which among other things regulate the relationship between a registered
	investment company and its investment adviser and prohibit or severely restrict principal transactions and joint transactions. Avoca is a sister company of Kohlberg Kravis
	Roberts & Co. L.P.





	Regulation as a Broker-Dealer





	        KKR Capital Markets LLC, one of our subsidiaries, is registered as a broker- dealer with the SEC under the Exchange Act and in
	all 50 U.S. States and U.S. territories and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA. MCS Capital Markets LLC is registered as a broker- dealer with the SEC under
	the Exchange Act and in 36 U.S. States. As a registered broker-dealer, KKR Capital Markets LLC and MCS Capital Markets LLC are subject to periodic SEC and FINRA examinations and reviews.
	A broker-dealer is subject to legal requirements covering all aspects of its securities business, including sales and trading practices, public and private securities offerings, use and safekeeping of
	customers' funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and retention and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers, employees and other associated persons. These requirements
	include the SEC's "uniform net capital rule," which specifies the minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain, requires a significant part of the broker- dealer's assets to be kept
	in relatively liquid form, imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing its capital and subjects any distributions or
	withdrawals of capital by a broker-dealer to notice requirements. These and other requirements also include rules that limit a broker-dealer's ratio of subordinated debt to equity in its regulatory
	capital composition, constrain a broker-dealer's ability to expand its business under certain circumstances and impose additional requirements when the broker-dealer participates in securities
	offerings of affiliated entities. Violations of these requirements may result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the suspension or
	expulsion from the securities industry of the broker-dealer or its officers or employees or other similar consequences by regulatory bodies.

	ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS






	        Investing in our securities involves risk. Persons investing in our securities should carefully consider the risks described below and
	the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, including our consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes. Any
	of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could also be
	adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally, as well as other risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial. In any such case,
	the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your original investment. While we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and
	reasonable, we can provide no assurance, and we make no representation, that our mitigation efforts will be successful.





	Risks Related to Our Business







	Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing
	the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.






	        Our business is materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions or events throughout the world, such
	as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation), trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and
	controls and national and international political circumstances (including




	36











	Table of Contents





	wars,
	terrorist acts or security operations). For example, the unprecedented turmoil in the global financial markets during 2008 and 2009 provoked significant volatility of securities prices,
	contraction in
	the availability of credit and the failure of a number of companies, including leading financing institutions, and had a material adverse effect on our businesses. While the adverse effects of that
	period have abated to a significant degree, there continue to be lingering signs of economic weakness, characterized by low levels of growth and high levels of unemployment and governmental deficits
	in major markets including the United States and Europe. In addition, while volatility has declined in 2013, global financial markets have experienced periods of significant volatility in particular
	following the downgrade by Standard & Poor's on August 5, 2011 of the long-term credit rating of U.S. Treasury debt from AAA to AA+. Furthermore while a number of policy actions have
	been implemented with respect to debt and banks in a number of European countries, Europe continues to experience negative growth and ongoing austerity. Deleveraging in the developed world is
	continuing and likely to persist in the near-term. In the U.S., while federal lawmakers passed certain interim measures to fund the federal government in October 2013, a failure to reach a longer term
	budget agreement could lead to another federal government shut down or otherwise adversely impact the financial markets. In the spring of 2013, concerns about the Federal Reserve's plan to scale back
	its monetary stimulus plan later in 2013 caused investors to sell off significant amounts of stocks and bonds, resulting in the rapid increase in interest rates. In the fourth quarter of 2013 the
	Federal Reserve announced a plan to gradually scale down its Large Scale Asset Purchase program commonly referred to as Quantitative Easing; this and further changes in monetary policy could impair
	the economic recovery in the U.S. and lead to increased volatility. Furthermore, while U.S. financial institutions have seen recent improvements, global financial institutions have generally not yet
	provided debt financing in amounts and on terms commensurate with what they provided prior to 2008.




	        Such
	market and economic conditions are outside our control and may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and the value of our investments. In addition,
	we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions and/or events. For example, as of March 31, 2009, the date of the lowest aggregate valuation of our private
	equity funds during the most recent downturn, the investments in the private equity funds contributed to us in the KPE Transaction were marked down to 67% of original cost, and values across all
	geographies declined. For example, as of March 31, 2009, the European Fund II, European Fund III, 2006 Fund and Asian Fund had multiples of invested capital of 0.5x, 0.6x, 0.7x and 0.8x,
	respectively. As of December 31, 2013, these same funds are each valued at multiples of invested capital of 1.5x, 1.4x, 1.6x and 1.8x, respectively. Our profitability may also be adversely
	affected by our fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame sufficient to match any decreases in net income relating to changes in market and
	economic conditions.




	        Unfavorable
	market conditions may reduce opportunities for our funds to make, exit and realize value from their investments. For example, when financing is not available, it is difficult
	for potential buyers to raise sufficient capital to purchase assets in our funds' portfolios. Consequently, we may earn lower than expected returns on investments, which could cause us to realize
	diminished or no carried interest. In addition, we may not be able to find suitable investments for the funds to effectively deploy capital, which could adversely affect our ability to raise new funds
	because we can generally only raise capital for a successor fund following the substantial and successful deployment of capital from the existing fund. In the event of poor performance by existing
	funds or during periods of unfavorable fundraising conditions, pressures by fund investors for lower fees, different fee sharing arrangements for transaction or other fees, and other concessions (for
	example, the inclusion of performance hurdles that require us in our newer funds, such as North America Fund XI and Asian Fund II, to generate a specified return on investment prior to our right to
	receive carried interest) will likely continue and could increase. The outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than for prior funds
	we have managed. In the circumstances described above, successor funds raised by us are also likely in many instances to be smaller than our comparable

	predecessor
	funds. Fund investors may also seek to redeploy capital away from certain of our credit or other non-private equity investment vehicles, which permit redemptions on relatively short
	notice, in order to meet liquidity needs or invest in other asset classes. Any of these developments could adversely affect our future revenues, net income, cash flow, financial condition or ability
	to retain our employees. See "Our inability to raise additional or successor funds could have a material adverse impact on our business" and "Our investors in future funds
	may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds, which could adversely affect our revenues."




	        During
	periods of difficult market or economic conditions or slowdowns (which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies), companies in which we have invested may
	experience decreased revenues, financial losses, credit rating downgrades, difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs. These companies may also have difficulty in
	expanding their businesses and operations or be unable to meet their debt service obligations or other expenses as they become due, including amounts payable to us. Negative financial results in our
	funds' portfolio companies may result in lower investment returns for our investment funds, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flow. To the extent the operating
	performance of such portfolio companies (as well as valuation multiples) deteriorate or do not improve, our funds may sell those assets at values that are less than we projected or even at a loss,
	thereby significantly affecting those funds' performance and consequently our operating results and cash flow and resulting in lower or no carried interest being paid to us. Adverse conditions may
	also increase the risk of default with respect to private equity, credit and other equity investments that we manage or the abandonment or foreclosure of our real asset investments. Even if economic
	and market conditions do improve broadly, adverse conditions in particular sectors may also cause our performance to suffer. Finally, low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic
	stagnation may negatively impact expected returns on all types of investments as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and the supply decreases.






	Changes in the debt financing markets may negatively impact the ability of our investment funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing for their
	investments or refinance existing debt and may increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income.






	        In the event that our funds are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at an
	increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms, our funds may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case,
	either of which could lead to a decrease in the investment income earned by us. Any failure by lenders to provide previously committed financing can also expose us to potential claims by sellers of
	businesses which we may have contracted to purchase. Similarly, our
	portfolio companies regularly utilize the corporate debt markets in order to obtain financing for their operations. To the extent that credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more
	expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance of those portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment returns on our funds. In addition, to the extent that conditions in the
	credit markets impair the ability of our portfolio companies to refinance or extend maturities on their outstanding debt, either on favorable terms or at all, the operating performance of those
	portfolio companies may be negatively impacted, which could impair the value of our investment in those portfolio companies and lead to a decrease in the investment income earned by us. In some cases,
	the inability of our portfolio companies to refinance or extend maturities may result in the inability of those companies to repay debt at maturity and may cause the companies to sell assets, undergo
	a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection, which would also likely impair the value of our investment and lead to a decrease in investment income earned by us.

	Adverse economic and market conditions may adversely affect our liquidity position, which could adversely affect our business operations in the future.






	        We expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to:






	




	continue to grow our business, including seeding new strategies and funding our capital commitments made to existing and
	future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies;








	




	service debt obligations, as well as any contingent liabilities that may give rise to future cash payments;








	




	fund cash operating expenses;








	




	pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings;








	




	make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy;








	




	underwrite commitments within our capital markets business; and








	




	acquire additional principal assets, including other investment advisory and broker-dealer businesses.






	        These
	liquidity requirements are significant and, in some cases, involve capital that will remain invested for extended periods of time. As of December 31, 2013, we have
	approximately $1.2 billion of remaining unfunded capital commitments to our investment funds. Our commitments to our funds will require significant cash outlays over time, and there can be no
	assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from realizations of investments to fund them. In addition, as of December 31, 2013, we had $1.0 billion of borrowings
	outstanding under our credit facilities and debt securities and $2.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. While we have long-term committed financings with substantial facility limits,
	the terms of those facilities will expire in 2016 and 2017 and our senior notes become due in 2020 and 2043 (see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	OperationsLiquidity"), and any borrowings thereunder will require refinancing or renewal, which could result in higher borrowing costs, or issuing equity. Depending on credit or other
	market conditions, we may not be able to renew all or part of these borrowings or find alternate sources of financing on commercially reasonable terms and we may not be able to raise equity. In
	addition, the underwriting commitments for our capital markets business may require significant cash obligations, and these commitments may also put pressure on our liquidity. The holding company for
	our capital markets business has entered into a credit agreement that provides for revolving borrowings of up to $500 million, which can be used in connection with our capital markets business,
	including placing and underwriting securities offerings. To the extent we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities in firm commitment underwritings or otherwise, we may be required to borrow
	under our credit agreement for our capital markets business to fund such obligations, which, depending on the size and timing of the obligations, may limit our ability to enter into other underwriting
	arrangements or similar activities, service existing debt obligations or otherwise grow our business. Regulatory capital requirements may also limit the ability of our broker-dealer subsidiaries to
	participate in underwriting or other transactions or to allocate our capital more efficiently across our businesses. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of KKR Prisma and a minority
	interest in Nephila, we may be obligated to make future deferred purchase price payments based on the respective performance of these businesses. In the event that our liquidity requirements were to
	exceed available liquid assets for the reasons specified above or for any other reason, we could be forced to sell assets or seek to raise debt or equity capital on unfavorable terms.

	The "clawback" or "net loss sharing" provisions in our governing agreements may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require us to return or contribute amounts to
	our funds and fund investors.






	        The partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds, including funds relating to private equity, mezzanine, infrastructure,
	energy, real estate, direct lending and special situations investments, generally include a "clawback" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general
	partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. Under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a fund, the general partner is
	required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry
	distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, including the effects of any performance thresholds.
	Excluding carried interest received by the general partners of funds that were not contributed to us in the KPE Transaction, as of December 31, 2013, no carried interest was subject to this
	clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry paying funds were liquidated at their December 31, 2013 fair values. Had the investments in such funds been liquidated at zero value, the
	clawback obligation would have been $1,350.7 million.




	        Certain
	private equity funds that were contributed to us in the KPE Transaction in 2009 also include a "net loss sharing provision." Upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to
	which a net loss sharing obligation applies, the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In these vehicles, such losses would be
	required to be paid by us to the fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed, and a greater
	share of investment losses would be allocable to us relative to the capital that we contributed to it as general partner. Based on the fair market values as of December 31, 2013, there would
	have been no net loss sharing obligation. If the vehicles were liquidated at zero value, the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately $496.4 million as of December 31,
	2013.




	        Prior
	to the KPE Transaction in 2009, certain of our principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to us had personally
	guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general
	partners' clawback obligations. The terms of the KPE Transaction require that our principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the KPE
	Transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Through investment realizations, this amount has been reduced to $217.8 million as of December 31, 2013. Using valuations as of
	December 31, 2013, no amounts are due with respect to the clawback obligation required to be funded by our principals. Carry distributions
	arising subsequent to the KPE Transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to us and our principals who participate in the carry pool. Unlike the clawback
	obligation, we will be responsible for amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify our principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such
	amounts. In addition, guarantees of or similar arrangements relating to clawback or net loss sharing obligations in favor of third party investors in an individual investment partnership by entities
	we own may limit distributions of carried interest more generally.






	Our earnings and cash flow are highly variable due to the nature of our business and we do not intend to provide earnings guidance, each of which may cause the value of
	interests in our business to be volatile.






	        Our earnings are highly variable from quarter to quarter due to the volatility of investment returns of most of our funds and other
	investment vehicles and our principal assets and the fees earned from our businesses. We recognize earnings on investments in our funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains
	(or losses) reported by such funds and for certain of our recent funds,




	40











	Table of Contents





	when
	a performance hurdle is achieved. A decline in realized or unrealized gains, a failure to achieve a performance hurdle or an increase in realized or unrealized losses, would adversely affect our
	net income. Fee income, which we recognize when contractually earned, can vary due to fluctuations in AUM, the number of investment transactions made by our funds, the number of portfolio companies we
	manage, the fee provisions contained in our funds and other investment products and transactions by our capital markets business. Fees for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 were
	$723.6 million, $568.4 million and $762.5 million, respectively. We may create new funds or investment products or vary the terms of our funds or investment products (for example
	our newer funds include performance hurdles), which may alter the composition or mix of our income from time to time. We may also experience fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter,
	including our revenue and net income, due to a number of other factors, including changes in the values of our funds' investments, changes in the amount of distributions or interest earned in respect
	of investments, changes in our operating expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions. Net income (loss) attributable to
	KKR & Co. L.P. for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 was $1.9 million, $560.8 million and $691.2 million, respectively. Such
	fluctuations may lead to variability in the value of interests in our business and cause our results for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in future periods. It may be
	difficult for us to achieve steady growth in net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis, which could in turn lead to large adverse movements in the value of interests in our business.




	        The
	timing and receipt of carried interest from our investment funds are unpredictable and will contribute to the volatility of our cash flows. For example, with respect to our private
	equity funds, carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback or net loss sharing provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a
	realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of
	performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining
	cost to the investments' fair value. Carried interest payments from investments depend on our funds' performance and opportunities for realizing gains, which may be limited. It takes a substantial
	period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities, to raise all the funds needed to make an investment and then to realize the cash value (or other proceeds) of an investment through a
	sale, public offering or other exit. To the extent an investment is not profitable, no carried interest shall be received from our funds with respect to that investment and, to the extent such
	investment remains unprofitable, we will only be entitled to a management fee on that investment. Furthermore, certain vehicles and separately managed accounts may not provide for the payment of carry
	at all. Even if an investment proves to be profitable, it may be several years before any profits can be realized in cash. We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur. In
	addition, if finance providers, such as commercial and investment banks, make it difficult for potential purchasers to secure financing to purchase companies in our investment funds' portfolio, it may
	decrease potential realization events and the potential to earn carried interest. A downturn in the equity markets would also make it more difficult to exit investments by selling equity securities.
	If we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter, the event may have a significant impact on our cash flows during the quarter that may not be replicated in subsequent quarters. A
	decline in realized or unrealized gains, or an increase in realized or unrealized losses, would adversely affect our investment income, which could further increase the volatility of our quarterly
	results.




	        In
	addition, with respect to certain of the funds that we advise, such as hedge funds, fund of funds and KFN, we are entitled to incentive fees that are generally paid annually,
	semi-annually or quarterly if the net asset value of a fund has increased over a certain pre-determined hurdle rate or a specified high-water mark. These funds, but not KFN, also have "high-water
	mark" provisions whereby if the funds have experienced losses in prior periods, we will not be able to earn incentive fees with respect to a fund investor's account until the net asset value of the
	fund investor's account exceeds the highest




	41











	Table of Contents





	period
	end value on which incentive fees were previously paid. The incentive fees we earn are therefore dependent on the net asset value of these funds or vehicles, which could lead to volatility in
	our quarterly results and cash flow. Fees, including incentive fees, from KFN will be eliminated upon the completion of the KFN merger on a segment basis.




	        The
	timing and receipt of carried interest also varies with the life cycle of our funds. Our carry paying funds that have completed their investment periods and are able to realize
	mature investments, referred to as being in a harvesting period, are more likely to make larger distributions than our carrying paying funds that are in their fund raising or investment periods that
	precede the harvesting
	period. During times when a significant portion of our assets under management is attributable to carry paying funds that are not in their harvesting periods, we may receive substantially lower
	carried interest distributions.






	A decline in the pace or size of investment by our funds or an increase in the amount of transaction fees and management or monitoring fees we share with our fund investors
	would result in our receiving less revenue from such fees






	        The transaction and management or monitoring fees that we earn are driven in part by the pace at which our funds make investments and
	the size of those investments. Any decline in that pace or the size of such investments would reduce our revenue from transaction and management or monitoring fees. Many factors could cause such a
	decline in the pace of investment or the transaction and management or monitoring fees we receive, including:






	




	the inability of our investment professionals to identify attractive investment opportunities;








	




	competition for such opportunities among other potential acquirers;








	




	decreased availability of capital or financing on attractive terms;








	




	our failure to consummate identified investment opportunities because of business, regulatory or legal complexities and
	adverse developments in the U.S. or global economy or financial markets;








	




	terms we may agree with our fund investors to increase the percentage of transaction or other fees we may share with them;
	and








	




	new regulations or actions of regulatory authorities.








	Our inability to raise additional or successor funds (or raise successor funds of a comparable size as our predecessor funds) could have a material adverse impact on our
	business.






	        Our current private equity funds and certain other funds and investment vehicles have a finite life and a finite amount of commitments
	from fund investors. Once a fund nears the end of its investment period, our success depends on our ability to raise additional or successor funds in order to keep making investments and, over the
	long term, earning management fees (although our funds and investment vehicles generally continue to earn management fees at a reduced fee rate after the expiration of their investment periods). Even
	if we are successful in raising successor funds, to the extent we are unable to raise successor funds of a comparable size to our predecessor funds or the extent that we are delayed in raising such a
	successor fund, our revenues may decrease as the investment period of our predecessor funds expire and associated fees decrease. For example, KKR North America Fund XI, our most recent private equity
	fund focused primarily on North America, is smaller than its predecessor fund. In addition, the management fee for our European Fund III will decrease beginning the second quarter as the fund enters
	its post-investment period on March 31, 2014, and we will not have a successor European private equity fund to offset such decrease in fees until such successor fund has its first close and
	commences its investment period. The evolving preferences of our fund investors may necessitate that alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure, such as




	42











	Table of Contents





	managed
	accounts, smaller funds and co-investment vehicles become a larger part of our business going forward. This could increase our cost of raising capital at the scale we have historically
	achieved. Furthermore, in order to raise capital for new strategies and products without drawing capital away from our existing products, we will need to seek new sources of capital. Institutional
	investors in funds that have suffered from decreasing returns, liquidity pressure, increased volatility or difficulty maintaining targeted asset allocations, may materially decrease or temporarily
	suspend making new fund investments. Such investors may elect to reduce their overall portfolio allocations to alternative investments such as private equity funds, resulting in a smaller overall pool
	of available capital in our industry. In addition, the asset allocation rules or regulations or investment policies to which such third-party investors are subject, could inhibit or restrict the
	ability of third-party investors to make investments in our investment funds. Coupled with a lack of distributions from their existing investment portfolios, many of these investors may have been left
	with disproportionately outsized remaining commitments to, and invested capital in, a number of investment funds, which may significantly limit their ability to make new commitments to third-party
	managed investment funds such as those advised by us.




	        Fund
	investors may also seek to redeploy capital away from certain of our credit vehicles, hedge fund, fund of funds or other investment vehicles, which permit redemptions on relatively
	short notice in order to meet liquidity needs or invest in other asset classes. We believe that our ability to avoid
	excessive redemption levels primarily depends on our funds' continued satisfactory performance, although redemptions may also be driven by other factors important to our fund investors, including
	their need for liquidity and compliance with investment mandates, even if our performance is superior. Any such redemptions would decrease our AUM and revenues.




	        In
	addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act, under what has become known as the "Volcker Rule," broadly prohibits depository institution
	holding companies (including foreign banks with U.S. branches or agencies), insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, or banking entities, from investing in
	third-party private equity funds like ours. Final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule were approved by the federal banking agencies, the SEC and the CFTC on December 10, 2013, although
	there is still uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Volcker Rule and the final regulations and their practical implications. Although banking entities will generally have until
	July 21, 2015 to conform their existing activities and investments to the requirements of the final regulations, they may be limited in their ability to undertake new contractual commitments to
	private equity funds like ours. Banking entities have historically represented an important class of investors for our funds, with financial institutions constituting approximately 16% of our AUM as
	of December 31, 2013, and it is possible that other institutions will not be available to replace this traditional source of capital for our private equity funds. Furthermore, divestitures by
	banking entities of interests in private equity funds and hedge funds over the next several years to comply with the Volcker Rule may lead to lower prices in the secondary market for our fund
	interests, which could have adverse implications for our ability to raise funds from investors who may have considered the availability of secondary market liquidity as a factor in determining whether
	to invest.




	        The
	number of funds raising capital varies from year to year, and in years where relatively few funds are raising capital, the growth of our AUM, FPAUM and associated fees may be
	significantly lower. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2013 several large, private equity funds, namely our North America Fund XI and Asian Fund II, were actively fundraising. AUM
	for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $94.3 billion, up from $75.5 billion as of December 31, 2012, of which $21.2 billion was attributable to new capital
	raised. As these funds have completed fundraising and as the fundraising outlook for our next Europe focused fund is uncertain, our growth in AUM, FPAUM and associated fees attributable to new capital
	raised may be significantly lower. In addition, we had several successful fundraises in 2013 for newer strategies such as Real Estate Partners Americas, Energy Income and Growth Fund and our Special
	Situations Fund, and there is no assurance that fundraises for other new strategies will experience similar success in the future.

	Our investors in future funds, including separately managed accounts, may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may be less
	favorable to us than those of our existing funds, which could adversely affect our revenues.






	        In connection with raising new funds or securing additional investments in existing funds, we negotiate terms for such funds and
	investments with investors. The outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than the terms of prior funds we have advised or funds
	advised by our competitors. For example such terms could restrict our ability to raise investment funds with investment objectives or strategies that compete with existing funds, reduce fee revenues
	we earn, reduce the percentage of profits on third-party capital in which we share, include a performance hurdle that requires us to generate a specified return on investment prior to our right to
	receive carried interest or add expenses and obligations for us in managing the fund or increase our potential liabilities. For example our newest private equity funds, including North America Fund XI
	and Asian Fund II, include a performance hurdle that requires us to generate a 7% return on investment prior to receiving our share of fund gains. Furthermore, as institutional investors increasingly
	consolidate their relationships with investment firms and competition becomes more acute, we may receive more of these requests to modify the terms in our new funds. Certain of our newer funds also
	include more favorable terms for fund investors that commit to early closes for our funds. Agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us could result in a decrease in our profitability.




	        Certain
	institutional investors have also publicly criticized certain fund fee and expense structures, including management or monitoring fees and transaction and advisory fees. We have
	received and expect to continue to receive requests from a variety of fund investors and groups representing such investors to decrease fees and to modify our carried interest and incentive fee
	structures, which could result in a reduction or delay in the timing of receipt of the fees and carried interest and incentive fees we earn. In September of 2009, the Institutional Limited Partners
	Association, or "ILPA," published a set of Private Equity Principles, or the "Principles," which were revised in January 2011. The Principles were developed in order to encourage discussion between
	limited partners and general partners regarding private equity fund partnership terms. Certain of the Principles call for enhanced "alignment of interests" between general partners and limited
	partners through modifications of some of the terms of fund arrangements, including proposed guidelines for fees and carried interest structures. We provided ILPA our endorsement of the Principles,
	representing an indication of our general support for the efforts of ILPA.




	        In
	addition, certain institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds, have demonstrated an increased preference for alternatives to the traditional
	investment fund structure, such as managed accounts, specialized funds and co-investment vehicles. We also have entered into strategic partnerships with individual investors whereby we manage that
	investor's capital across a variety of our products on separately negotiated terms. There can be no assurance that such alternatives will be as profitable to us as the traditional investment fund
	structure, and the impact such a trend could have on our results of operations, if widely implemented, is unclear. Moreover, certain institutional investors are demonstrating a preference to in-source
	their own investment professionals and to make direct investments in alternative assets without the assistance of private equity advisers like us. Such institutional investors may become our
	competitors and could cease to be our clients.




	        Any
	agreement to terms less favorable to us could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.






	The investment management business is intensely competitive, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.






	        We compete as an investment manager for both fund investors and investment opportunities. The investment management business is highly
	fragmented, with our competitors consisting primarily of sponsors of public and private investment funds, real estate development companies, business

	Table of Contents





	development
	companies, investment banks, commercial finance companies and operating companies acting as strategic buyers of businesses. We believe that competition for fund investors is based
	primarily on:






	




	investment performance;








	




	investor liquidity and willingness to invest;








	




	investor perception of investment managers' drive, focus and alignment of interest;








	




	business reputation;








	




	the duration of relationships with fund investors;








	




	the quality of services provided to fund investors;








	




	pricing;








	




	fund terms (including fees); and








	




	the relative attractiveness of the types of investments that have been or will be made.






	        We
	believe that competition for investment opportunities is based primarily on the pricing, terms and structure of a proposed investment and certainty of execution.




	        A
	number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:






	




	a number of our competitors in some of our businesses may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources
	and more personnel than we do, and, in the case of some asset classes, longer operating histories, more established relationships or greater experience;








	




	fund investors may materially decrease their allocations in new funds due to their experiences following an economic
	downturn, the limited availability of capital, regulatory requirements or a desire to consolidate their relationships with investment firms;








	




	some of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by fund investors as having better expertise in a
	specific asset class or geographic region than we do;








	




	some of our competitors have agreed to terms on their investment funds or products that may be more favorable to fund
	investors than our funds or products, such as lower management fees, greater fee sharing, or performance hurdles for carried interest, and therefore we may be forced to match or otherwise revise our
	terms to be less favorable to us than they have been in the past;








	




	some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors' funds or other available investment products;








	




	our competitors have raised or may raise significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment
	objectives and strategies to our funds, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that many alternative
	investment strategies seek to exploit;








	




	some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to
	us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities;








	




	some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which
	could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments;








	




	some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation or less regulatory scrutiny and accordingly may have more
	flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than we do and/or bear less expense to comply with such regulations than we do;

	there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding the formation of new funds, including a relatively low cost of
	entering these businesses, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various lines of business, including major commercial and investment banks and other financial institutions, have
	resulted in increased competition;








	




	some fund investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager that is not publicly traded, is smaller, or manages
	fewer investment products; and








	




	other industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away
	from us.






	        We
	may lose investment opportunities in the future if we do not match investment prices, structures and terms offered by competitors. Our competitors that are corporate buyers may be
	able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment. Alternatively, we may experience decreased
	investment returns and increased risks of loss if we match investment prices, structures and terms offered by competitors. Moreover, as a result, if we are forced to compete with other investment
	firms on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current fund fee, carried interest or other terms. There is a risk that fees and carried interest in the alternative investment
	management industry will decline, without regard to the historical performance of a manager. Fee or carried interest income reductions on existing or future funds, without corresponding decreases in
	our cost structure, would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.




	        In
	addition, if interest rates were to rise or if market conditions for competing investment products become or are favorable and such products begin to offer rates of return superior to
	those achieved by our funds, the attractiveness of our funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease. This competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make
	successful investments and limit our ability to raise future funds, either of which would adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flow.






	Our structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. These structures also are subject to
	potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.






	        The U.S. federal income tax treatment of our unitholders depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of
	complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. You should be aware that the U.S. federal income tax rules are constantly under review by
	persons involved in the legislative process, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established concepts,
	statutory changes, revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations. The present U.S. federal income tax treatment of owning our common units may be modified by administrative,
	legislative or judicial interpretation at any time, and any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. For instance, changes to the U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations
	thereof could make it more difficult or impossible for us to be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
	affect the tax considerations of owning our common units, change the character or treatment of portions of our income (including, for instance, the treatment of carried interest as ordinary income
	rather than capital gain) and adversely impact your investment in our common units. See the discussion below under "The U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would have
	(i) in some cases after a ten-year period, precluded us from qualifying as a partnership or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and (ii) taxed
	certain income and gains at increased rates. If any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us, the after tax income and gain related to our business, as well as the market price of our
	units, could be reduced." Our organizational documents and agreements give the Managing Partner broad authority to modify the amended and restated




	46











	Table of Contents





	partnership
	agreement from time to time as the Managing Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate, without the consent of the unitholders, to address changes in U.S. federal, state and local
	income tax regulations, legislation or interpretation. In some circumstances, such revisions could have a material adverse impact on some or all unitholders. For instance, the Managing Partner could
	elect at some point to treat us as an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable state) income tax purposes. If the Managing Partner were to do this, the U.S. federal income
	tax consequences of owning our common units would be materially different. Moreover, certain assumptions and conventions will be applied in an attempt to comply with applicable rules and to report
	income, gain, deduction, loss and credit to unitholders in a manner that reflects such unitholders' beneficial ownership of partnership items, taking into account variation in ownership interests
	during each taxable year because of trading activity. However, those assumptions and conventions may not be in compliance with all aspects of applicable tax requirements. It is possible that the IRS
	will assert successfully that the conventions and assumptions used by us do not satisfy the technical requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and/or Treasury regulations and could require that items
	of income, gain, deductions, loss or credit, including interest deductions, be adjusted, reallocated or disallowed in a manner that adversely affects our unitholders.






	The U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would have (i) in some cases after a ten-year period, precluded us from qualifying as a partnership or required us
	to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and (ii) taxed certain income and gains at increased rates. If any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us, the
	after tax income and gain related to our business, as well as the market price of our units, could be reduced.






	        Over the past several years, a number of legislative and administrative proposals have been introduced and, in certain cases, have been
	passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, that would have, in general, treated income and gains, including gain on sale, attributable to an interest in an investment services partnership interest,
	or "ISPI", as income subject to a new blended tax rate that is higher than under current law, except to the extent such ISPI would have been considered under the legislation to be a qualified capital
	interest. Your interest in us, our interest in KKR Fund Holdings L.P. and the interests that KKR Fund Holdings L.P. holds in entities that
	are entitled to receive carried interest may have been classified as ISPIs for purposes of this legislation. It is unclear when or whether the U.S. Congress will pass such legislation or what
	provisions will be included in any legislation, if enacted.




	        The
	most recent legislative proposals provided that, for taxable years beginning ten years after the date of enactment, income derived with respect to an ISPI that is not a qualified
	capital interest and that is subject to the rules discussed above would not meet the qualifying income requirements under the publicly traded partnership rules. Therefore, if similar legislation is
	enacted, following such ten-year period, we would be precluded from qualifying as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes or be required to hold all such ISPIs through corporations,
	possibly U.S. corporations. If we were taxed as a U.S. corporation or required to hold all ISPIs through corporations, our effective tax rate would increase significantly. The federal statutory rate
	for corporations is currently 35%. In addition, we could be subject to increased state and local taxes. Furthermore, you could be subject to tax on our conversion into a corporation or any
	restructuring required in order for us to hold our ISPIs through a corporation. KKR's principals and other professionals could face additional adverse tax consequences under the legislation, which
	might thereby adversely affect KKR's ability to offer attractive incentive opportunities for key personnel.




	        The
	Obama administration has submitted similar legislation to Congress that would tax income and gain, now treated as capital gains, including gain on disposition of interests,
	attributable to an ISPI at rates higher than the capital gains rate applicable to such income under current law, with an exception for certain qualified capital interests. The proposed legislation
	would also characterize certain income and gain in respect of ISPIs as non-qualifying income under the publicly traded partnership

	rules
	after a ten-year transition period from the effective date, with an exception for certain qualified capital interests. The Obama administration's published revenue proposals for 2013 and prior
	years contained similar proposals.




	        States
	and other jurisdictions have also considered legislation to increase taxes with respect to carried interest. For example, New York has periodically considered legislation under
	which you could be subject to New York state income tax on income in respect of our common units as a result of certain activities of our affiliates in New York, although it is unclear when or whether
	such legislation will be enacted.




	        If
	the proposed legislation described above or any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us, the after tax income and gain related to our business, as well as the market
	price of our units, could be reduced.






	Additional proposed changes in the U.S. taxation of businesses could adversely affect us.






	        The Obama administration has announced other proposals for potential reform to the U.S. federal income tax rules for businesses,
	including reducing the deductibility of interest for corporations, reducing the top marginal rate on corporations and subjecting entities, like many of our entities, currently treated as partnerships
	for tax purposes to an entity-level income tax similar to the corporate income tax. Several proposals for reform, if enacted, could adversely affect us and could reduce the cash we have available for
	distributions to unitholders or for other uses by us. It is unclear what any actual legislation could provide, when it would be proposed or what its prospects for enactment could be.




	        Other
	proposals contemplate the migration of the United States from a "worldwide" system of taxation, pursuant to which U.S. corporations are taxed on their worldwide income, to a
	territorial tax system where U.S. corporations are taxed only on their U.S. source income (subject to certain exceptions for income derived in low-tax jurisdictions from the exploitation of intangible
	assets) at a top corporate tax rate that would be 25%. The territorial tax system proposals envisage a revenue neutral result and consequently include revenue raisers to offset the reduction in the
	tax rate and base which may or may not be detrimental to the value of our common units. A variation of this proposal contemplates a similar territorial U.S. tax system, but with more expansive U.S.
	taxation of the foreign profits of some non-U.S. subsidiaries. Such proposal could have the effect of accelerating and/or increasing the U.S. taxes payable with respect to earnings of certain of our
	and our portfolio companies' non-U.S. subsidiaries. This proposal would also eliminate the withholding tax exemption on portfolio interest debt obligations for investors residing in non-treaty
	jurisdictions, which could result in additional U.S. withholding taxes imposed on U.S-source interest attributable to certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries or non-U.S. investors. Whether these
	proposals will be enacted by the government and in what form is unknown, as are the ultimate consequences of the proposed legislation.






	We depend on our founders and other key personnel, the loss of whose services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.






	        We depend on the efforts, skills, reputations and business contacts of our principals, including our founders, Henry Kravis and George
	Roberts, and other key personnel, the information and deal flow they and others generate during the normal course of their activities and the synergies among the diverse fields of expertise and
	knowledge held by our professionals. Accordingly, our success depends on the continued service of these individuals, who are not obligated to remain employed with us. The loss of the services of any
	of them could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, net income and cash flows and could harm our ability to maintain or grow AUM in existing funds or raise additional funds in the future.




	48











	Table of Contents





	        Our
	principals and other key personnel possess substantial experience and expertise and have strong business relationships with investors in our funds and other members of the business
	community. As a result, the loss of these personnel could jeopardize our relationships with investors in our funds and members of the business community and result in the reduction of AUM or fewer
	investment opportunities. For example, if any of our principals were to join or form a competing firm, our business, results and financial condition could suffer.




	        Furthermore,
	the agreements governing our private equity funds and certain non-private equity investment funds managed by us provide that in the event certain "key persons" in these
	funds (for example, both of Messrs. Kravis and Roberts for our private equity funds, and, in the case of certain geographically or product focused funds, one or more of the executives focused
	on such funds) generally cease to actively manage a fund, investors in the fund will be entitled to: (i) in the case of our private equity funds, reduce, in whole or in part, their capital
	commitments available for further investments; and (ii) in the case of certain of our credit or other non-private equity investment funds, withdraw all or any portion of their capital accounts,
	in each case on an investor-by-investor basis (which could lead possibly to a liquidation of those funds). The occurrence of such an event would likely have a significant negative impact on our
	revenue, net income and cash flow.






	If we cannot retain and motivate our principals and other key personnel and recruit, retain and motivate new principals and other key personnel, our business, results and
	financial condition could be adversely affected.






	        Our most important asset is our people, and our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our principals and other
	professionals, and to a substantial degree on our ability to retain and motivate our principals and other key personnel and to strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel,
	including new principals. However, we may not be successful in these efforts as the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive. Our ability to recruit, retain and motivate
	our professionals is dependent on our ability to offer highly attractive incentive opportunities. If legislation, such as the recent carried interest proposals were to be enacted, income and gains
	recognized with respect to carried interest would be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. Such legislation would materially increase the amount
	of taxes that we, our principals and other professionals would be required to pay, thereby adversely affecting our ability to offer such attractive incentive opportunities. See "Risks
	Related to U.S. Taxation". In addition, there are pending laws and regulations that seek to regulate the compensation of certain of our employees. See "Extensive Regulation of our
	business affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could result in
	additional burdens on our business." The loss of even a small number of our investment professionals could jeopardize the performance of our funds and other investment products, which
	would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Efforts to retain or attract investment professionals may result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our
	profitability.




	        Many
	of our principals hold interests in our business through KKR Holdings. These individuals currently receive financial benefits from our business in the form of distributions and
	amounts funded by KKR Holdings and through their direct and indirect participation in the value of KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings. While all of our employees and our principals
	receive base salaries from us, profit-based cash bonuses for certain principals currently are borne by KKR Holdings from cash reserves based upon distributions on a portion of KKR Group Partnership
	Units held by KKR Holdings. In 2013, the amount of such profit-based cash bonuses paid by KKR Holdings L.P. was $90.6 million. There can be no assurance that KKR Holdings will have
	sufficient cash available to continue to make profit-based cash payments and we expect to pay a portion, or eventually all, of these cash bonus payments as KKR Holdings becomes unable to reserve cash
	for bonus compensation as our principals who hold equity interests through KKR Holdings become entitled to the cash distributions on the KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings.

	        Moreover, in connection with the KPE Transaction, we made large grants of KKR Holdings units that vest in installments over a five year period commencing
	October 1, 2009 and will completely vest, subject to certain transfer restrictions on October 1, 2014. Our principals may also receive additional equity interests in our business through
	equity awards granted by KKR Holdings, which does not cause any dilution. However, we have granted and will grant some or all of the types of equity awards historically granted by KKR Holdings from
	our Equity Incentive Plan, which has caused dilution. In addition, we may be unwilling to grant our employees additional significant equity awards in our business, whether before or even after all of
	the KKR Holdings units granted in October 2009 vest in October 2014, and the value of the grants and distributions they receive in respect of their existing awards may be lower than anticipated. This
	may limit our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented personnel. In order to recruit and retain existing and future investment professionals, we may need to increase the level of compensation
	that we pay to them, which may cause a higher percentage of our revenue to be paid out in the form of compensation, which would have an adverse impact on our profit margins.




	        In
	addition, there is no guarantee that the confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements to which our principals are subject, together with our other arrangements with them, will
	prevent them from leaving us, joining our competitors or otherwise competing with us or that these agreements will be enforceable in all cases. These agreements will expire after a certain period of
	time, at which point each of our principals would be free to compete against us and solicit investors in our funds, clients and employees. Depending on which entity is a party to these agreements
	and/or the laws applicable to them, we may not be able to enforce them or become subject to lawsuits or other claims, and certain of these agreements might be waived, modified or amended at any time
	without our consent. See "Certain
	Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director IndependenceConfidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Agreements."




	        We
	strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces our culture of collaboration, motivation and alignment of interests with fund investors. If we do not continue to develop and
	implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain our culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which
	could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.






	Operational risks may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth.






	        We rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are
	disabled, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our funds, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. In addition, we operate in businesses that are highly
	dependent on information systems and technology. Our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, may be subject to security risks, and the cost of
	maintaining such systems may increase from our current level. Such a failure to accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to such information systems, could have a material adverse effect on
	our business. Furthermore, we depend on our principal offices in New York City, where most of our administrative personnel are located, for the continued operation of our business. A disaster or a
	disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business,
	or directly affecting our principal offices, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption. Our business continuation or disaster
	recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our
	losses, if at all.




	        Our
	operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures
	and




	50











	Table of Contents





	endeavor
	to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and
	other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our fund investors' or counterparties' confidential and other information
	processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause
	interruptions or malfunctions in our, our fund investors', our counterparties' or third parties' operations, which could result in significant losses, increased costs or reputational damage. Finally,
	we rely on third party service providers for certain aspects of our business, including for certain information systems, technology, administration, tax and compliance matters. Any interruption or
	deterioration in the performance of these third parties could impair the quality of our and our funds' operations and could impact our reputation and adversely affect our businesses and limit our
	ability to grow.




	        Our
	portfolio companies also rely on data processing systems and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information, including payment and health information. A disruption or
	compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on the value of these businesses.






	Our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses, and we may expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and
	businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.






	        We intend, to the extent that market conditions warrant, to seek to grow our businesses by increasing AUM in existing businesses,
	pursuing new investment strategies, including investment opportunities in new asset classes, developing new types of investment structures and products (such as managed accounts and structured
	products), and expanding into new geographic markets and businesses. We have in recent years opened offices in Asia, the Middle East and South America, and also developed a capital markets business in
	the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, which we intend to grow and diversify. We have also launched a number of new investment initiatives in areas such as real estate, energy,
	infrastructure and hedge funds. We have and may continue to pursue growth through acquisitions of other investment management companies, acquisitions of critical business partners, strategic
	partnerships or other strategic initiatives, which may include entering into new lines of business. For example, recently we have formed Merchant Capital Solutions LLC, a joint venture
	partnership that seeks to provide capital markets services to mid-market and sponsor-backed companies, and Maritime Finance Company, a new specialty finance company created to lend to the maritime
	industry. In addition, we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other alternative or traditional investment managers. For example, we have built and expanded our hedge fund solutions business
	with the acquisition of Prisma and expanded our European credit business with our acquisition of Avoca. To the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions, undertake other strategic
	initiatives or enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with:






	




	the required investment of capital and other resources;








	




	the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring
	inappropriate amounts of risk or liability or have not appropriated planned for such activities;








	




	the possibility of diversion of management's attention from our core business;








	




	the possibility of disruption of our ongoing business;








	




	combining, integrating or developing operational and management systems and controls;








	




	potential increase in concentration of the investors in our funds;






	51











	Table of Contents







	




	disagreements with joint venture partners or other stakeholders in strategic partnerships; and








	




	the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in foreign
	jurisdictions, including taxation.






	        Entry
	into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased
	litigation and regulatory risk. If a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our
	expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties
	in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.






	We may not be successful in executing upon or managing the complexities of new investment strategies, markets and businesses, which could adversely affect our business,
	results of operations and financial condition.






	        Our growth strategy is based, in part, on the expansion of our platform through selective investment in, and development or acquisition
	of, businesses and investment strategies complementary to our business. The expansion into new products and geographies has demanded greater management attention and dedication of resources to manage
	the increasing complexity of operations and regulatory compliance. This growth strategy involves a number of risks, including the risk that the expected synergies from a newly developed product or
	strategic alliance will not be realized, that the expected results will not be achieved, that new strategies are not appropriately planned for or integrated into the firm, that the new strategies may
	conflict, detract from or compete against our existing businesses, that the investment process, controls and procedures that we have developed around our existing platform will prove insufficient or
	inadequate or that our information systems and technology, including related security systems, may prove to be inadequate. We have also entered into strategic partnerships and separately managed
	accounts, which lack the scale of our traditional funds and are more costly to administer. The prevalence of these accounts may also present conflicts and introduce complexity in the deployment of
	capital. The offering of investment products to retail investors, including our funds registered under the Investment Company Act, may result in increased compliance and litigation costs. We may also
	incur significant charges in connection with such investments, which ultimately may result in significant losses and costs. Such losses could adversely impact our business, results of operations and
	financial condition, as well as do harm to our professional reputation.






	Our proposed merger with KFN is subject to uncertainty and our acquisitions, including our proposed acquisition of KFN, expose us to increased risks and liabilities.






	        From time to time, we or our affiliates acquire or agree to acquire other businesses or invest in other businesses. These acquisitions
	include our proposed merger with KFN. The completion of these acquisitions is subject to various conditions and may expose us to increased risks and liabilities, such
	as:






	




	We may be unable to obtain the regulatory clearances required to complete the acquisitions or, in order to do so, we may
	be required to comply with material restrictions or satisfy material conditions. If we must take such actions, it could be detrimental to us or to the combined organization following the consummation
	of the relevant acquisition. Furthermore, these actions could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the relevant acquisition or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues
	of the combined organization following the consummation of the relevant acquisitions.








	




	We incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with our acquisitions including non-recurring
	transaction-related costs. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not






	52











	Table of Contents







	limited
	to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses.






	




	Failure to successfully combine the acquired businesses in the expected timeframe may adversely affect the future results
	of the combined organization, and, consequently, the value of our common units. The success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining
	our businesses and the acquired business on a timely basis. Failure to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could result in declines in the market value of KKR common units.








	




	Failure to complete an acquisition, or significant delays in completing an acquisition, could negatively affect the
	trading prices of our common units and our future business and financial results. Completion of an acquisition is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that approval by the
	shareholders or by governmental agencies is not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied. If an acquisition is not completed we may also be liable for damages or have to pay certain
	significant costs relating to the acquisition; and the attention of our management will have been diverted to the acquisition rather than our own operations and pursuit of other opportunities that
	could have been beneficial to us.








	




	Purported class action complaints may be, and in the case of the proposed KFN merger have been, filed challenging the
	acquisition, and an unfavorable judgment or ruling in these lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of an acquisition and result in substantial costs. In the case of the proposed KFN merger,
	multiple class action lawsuits are currently pending that challenge the merger. Each lawsuit names as defendants some or all of the parties to the merger and the individual members of KFN's board of
	directors. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin the proposed merger. If these lawsuits are not dismissed or otherwise resolved, they could prevent and/or delay completion of the merger
	and result in substantial costs, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors. Additional lawsuits may be filed in connection with the proposed merger. There can be no
	assurance that any of the defendants will prevail in the pending litigation or in any future litigation. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim may adversely affect the combined
	organization's business, financial condition or results of operations.








	




	Acquisitions, if consummated, subject us to additional risks related to the acquired entity's business and operations. For
	example, following the KFN merger, if completed, we will be subject to the risk that the conduct of KFN's operations may render it an investment company and we would be required to sell assets, change
	the manner of its operations or register KFN as an investment company. If KFN were to be deemed to be an investment company, maintaining KFN's investment company status might also make it more
	difficult for KKR to comply with its own exemption from investment company status under the Investment Company Act. See "If KFN were deemed to be an 'investment company' subject to
	regulation under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business." Upon completion of the merger, we will also have increased exposure to the CLO and
	leveraged finance markets. See "Dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those
	investments." Upon the completion of the merger, it is expected that KFN would be consolidated, and, as a result, the management and incentive fees we earn from KFN would be eliminated on a segment
	basis. In addition, in enlarging our balance sheet, we are pursuing a different business strategy than our competitors, which generally have smaller balance sheets than we do. To the extent we are
	unsuccessful in developing this strategy, our business and financial results may suffer.

	If we are unable to syndicate the securities or indebtedness or realize returns on investments financed with our principal assets, our liquidity, business, results of
	operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.






	        Our principal assets provide us with a significant source of capital to grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our
	transactions and underwrite commitments in our capital markets business. Our principal assets have provided a source of capital to underwrite loans,
	securities or other financial instruments, which we generally expect to syndicate to third parties. To the extent that we are unable to do so, we may be required to sell such investments at a
	significant loss or hold them indefinitely. If we are required to retain investments on our balance sheet for an extended period of time, the inability of our capital markets business to complete
	additional transactions would impair our results. In addition, as our principal assets have been a significant source of financing for new strategies, to the extent that such strategies are not
	successful or our principal assets cease to provide adequate liquidity, we would be limited in our ability to seed new businesses or support our existing business as effectively as contemplated.






	Extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory
	focus or legislative or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business.






	        Our business is subject to extensive regulation. We are subject to regulation, including periodic examinations, by governmental and
	self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and foreign government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, are
	empowered to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including censure, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or
	the suspension or expulsion of applicable licenses and memberships. Even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a
	regulator were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing
	clients and fund investors or fail to gain new clients and fund investors.




	        As
	a result of market disruptions in the past years as well as highly publicized financial scandals, regulators and fund investors exhibited concerns over the integrity of the U.S. and
	global financial markets. In response, regulators in the United States and elsewhere launched programs of regulatory reform that have broad implications for us and for our funds, as well as for many
	of the markets in which we and they operate. In addition, the private equity industry has come under increased political, regulatory and news media scrutiny with politicians, governmental officials,
	and regulators focusing on the taxation of carried interest and the private equity industry's allocation of expenses to the funds and valuation practices. Any changes in the regulatory framework
	applicable to our business, including the changes and potential changes described below, as well as adverse news media attention, may impose additional expenses or capital requirements on us, limit
	our fundraising for our investment products, result in limitations in the manner in which our business is conducted, have an adverse impact upon our financial condition, results of operations or
	prospects, impair executive retention or recruitment and require substantial attention by senior management. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or
	initiatives that may be proposed or may become law on our business or the markets in which we operate. If enacted, any new regulation or regulatory framework could negatively impact our funds and us
	in a number of ways, including increasing our costs and the cost for our funds of investing, borrowing or hedging, increasing the funds' or our regulatory costs, imposing additional burdens on the
	funds' or our staff, and potentially requiring the disclosure of sensitive information. In addition, we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and
	rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. New laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult or more expensive, affect




	54











	Table of Contents





	the
	manner in which we conduct business and divert significant management and operational resources and attention from our business. Moreover, we anticipate the potential for an increase in regulatory
	investigations and new or enhanced reporting requirements of the trading and other investment activities of alternative investment management funds and firms, including our funds and us. Such
	investigations and reporting obligations will likely impose additional expenses on us, may require the attention of senior management and increase the complexity of managing our business and may
	result in fines if we or any of our funds are deemed to have violated any regulations.




	        There
	have been a number of legislative or regulatory proposals affecting the financial sector in the United States. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
	Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act, that President Obama signed into law on July 21, 2010, creates a significant amount of new regulation. The Dodd-Frank
	Act:






	




	establishes the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, a federal agency charged with, among other things,
	designating systemically important nonbank financial companies for heightened prudential supervision and making recommendations regarding the imposition of enhanced regulatory standards regarding
	capital, leverage, conflicts and other requirements for financial firms deemed to pose a systemic threat to the financial stability of the U.S. economy;








	




	requires private equity and hedge fund advisers to register with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act (as described
	elsewhere in this report, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries KKR Asset Management LLC and Prisma Capital Partners LP are registered
	with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act), to maintain extensive records and to file reports if deemed necessary for purposes of systemic risk assessment by certain
	governmental bodies;








	




	authorizes federal regulatory agencies to review and, in certain cases, prohibit compensation arrangements at financial
	institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct deemed to encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions;








	




	requires public companies to adopt and disclose policies requiring, in the event the company is required to issue an
	accounting restatement, the clawback of related incentive compensation from current and former executive officers;








	




	restricts the ability of banking organizations to sponsor or invest in private equity and hedge funds;








	




	grants the U.S. government resolution authority to liquidate or take emergency measures with regard to troubled financial
	institutions that fall outside the existing resolution authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC; and








	




	creates a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within the U.S. Federal Reserve.






	        Many
	of these provisions are subject to further rule making and to the discretion of regulatory bodies, such as the FSOC. For example, the following rulemaking has been enacted and the
	following notices of proposed rulemakings have recently been announced that may apply to us or our subsidiaries:






	




	On April 3, 2012, the FSOC issued a final rule and interpretive guidance regarding the process by which it will
	designate nonbank financial companies as systemically important. The rule and guidance detail a three-stage review process, with the level of scrutiny increasing at each stage. During the first stage,
	the FSOC will apply a broad set of uniform quantitative metrics to identify nonbank financial companies that warrant additional review. In this first stage, the FSOC considers whether a nonbank
	financial company has at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets and whether it meets other thresholds relating to credit default swaps outstanding, derivative liabilities, loans and
	bonds outstanding, a minimum leverage ratio of total






	55











	Table of Contents







	consolidated
	assets to total equity of 15 to 1, and a short-term debt ratio of debt (with maturities less than 12 months) to total consolidated assets of 10%. A company that meets both the
	asset test and at least one of the other thresholds will be subject to additional review in Stage 2. Although we have more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets as of
	December 31, 2013 and we believe we should not currently meet the Stage 1 criteria outlined above, those criteria as well as our business may evolve over time. Additional uncertainty is
	created because the FSOC retains authority to designate any nonbank financial company as systemically important, even if the company does not meet the Stage 1 criteria. The FSOC will consider
	in the future whether to establish "an additional set of metrics or thresholds tailored to evaluate hedge funds and private equity firms and their advisers." The preamble to the final rule notes that
	less regulatory data is generally available for hedge funds and private equity firms, but indicates that, in developing any such additional metrics or thresholds, it intends to review financial
	disclosures that private fund advisers are required to file with the SEC and CFTC, as further described below. If the FSOC were to determine that we were a systemically important nonbank financial
	company, we would be subject to a heightened degree of regulation, including more stringent standards relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management, resolution planning and credit exposure
	reporting and concentration limits, restrictions on acquisitions and annual stress testing by the Federal Reserve. There can be no assurance that nonbank financial firms such as us will not become
	subject to the aforementioned restrictions or other requirements for financial firms deemed to be systemically important to the financial stability of the U.S. economy.






	




	The Dodd-Frank Act, under what has become known as the "Volcker Rule," broadly prohibits depository institution holding
	companies (including foreign banks with U.S. branches or agencies), insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates (", or banking entities"), from investing in
	third-party private equity funds like ours. See "Our inability to raise additional or successor funds (or raise successor funds of a comparable size as our predecessor funds) could have a
	material adverse impact on our business."








	




	On October 26, 2011, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring certain advisers to private funds to periodically file
	reports on a new Form PF. Large private fund advisers including advisers with at least $1.5 billion in assets under management attributable to hedge funds and advisers with at least
	$2 billion in assets under management attributable to private equity funds are subject to more detailed and in certain cases more frequent reporting requirements. The information will be used
	by the FSOC in monitoring risks to the U.S. financial system.








	




	On March 2, 2011, the SEC proposed a rule as part of a joint rule-making effort with federal banking regulators
	designed to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material
	losses. The proposed rule would cover financial institutions with total consolidated assets of at least $1 billion, including investment advisers and broker-dealers, and provide heightened
	requirements for financial institutions with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion. The application of this rule to us could require us to substantially revise our compensation
	strategy and affect our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees.








	




	The Dodd-Frank Act amends the Exchange Act to compensate and protect whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original
	information to the SEC and establishes a fund to be used to pay whistleblowers who will be entitled to receive a payment equal to between 10% and 30% of certain monetary sanctions imposed in a
	successful government action resulting from the information provided by the whistleblower.

	        As
	mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, has proposed or adopted a series of rules to establish a comprehensive new regulatory framework for
	swaps and security based swaps. For example in October 2011, the CFTC passed rules instituting position limits on certain physical commodity futures contracts, as well as swaps that are economically
	equivalent. Absent an applicable exemption, the regulations would have required aggregation of positions in accounts in which any person, directly or indirectly, holds an ownership interest of 10% or
	more, as well as accounts over which that person controls trading. In September 2012, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia struck down these rules, but the CFTC has issued new rules
	regarding position limits that are substantially similar to the October 2011 rules. The timing of the adoption and the content of the final rules remain unclear. If the proposed rules are adopted in
	substantially the form proposed and to the extent that we do not qualify for an exemption, we may be required to aggregate the positions of our various investment funds and the positions of our
	portfolio companies. Although the scope of the new regulatory framework is still unclear, these and other new rules may require us and our portfolio companies to limit our trading activities, and in
	addition, our funds may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions in particular industries or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case.




	        The
	Dodd-Frank Act also imposes regulatory requirements on the trading of swaps, including requirements that most swaps be executed on an exchange or "swap execution facility" and
	cleared through a central clearing house. Although these requirements presently apply only to certain classes of interest rate swaps and credit default swaps, the CFTC is expected to mandate central
	execution and clearing with respect to additional classes of swaps in the future. In addition, entities acting as dealers or "major swap participants" must register in the appropriate category and
	comply with capital, margin, record keeping, reporting and business conduct rules and that over-the-counter derivative transactions
	be reported to central swaps data repositories. The imposition of these requirements could increase the cost of trading in the derivative markets, which could in turn make it more expensive and
	difficult for us or our funds to enter into swaps and other derivatives in the normal course of our business. Among other things, margin requirements for swaps and other derivatives are expected to be
	greater than was previously the case in the over-the-counter market. Moreover, these increased regulatory responsibilities and increased costs could reduce trading levels in the derivative markets by
	a number of market participants, which could in turn adversely impact liquidity in the markets and expose our funds to greater risks and reduce hedging opportunities in connection with their trading
	activities.




	        In
	February 2012, the CFTC issued a final rule that rescinded an exemption from CFTC registration for commodity pool operators in connection with privately offered funds, narrowed an
	exception from commodity pool operator registration obligations with respect to registered investment companies, and amended related rules and guidance. The CFTC and its staff have subsequently issued
	interpretive guidance and no-action letters regarding these exceptions and exclusions, and are expected to issue further guidance, including guidance regarding the registration obligations of
	operators of funds-of-funds. In addition, under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has assumed regulatory authority over many types of swaps. As a result, operating pooled funds or providing
	investment advice to clients that trade these swaps is now a basis for registration with the CFTC, absent an applicable exemption. Monitoring and analysis of whether these new rules would require us
	or one or more of our affiliates to register with the CFTC as commodity pool operators and/or commodity trading advisors requires management and operational resources and attention. Furthermore,
	operating our funds in a manner consistent with one or more exemptions from registration with the CFTC may limit the activities of certain of our funds, including our funds of funds. Registration with
	the CFTC, if required, could impact our operations and add additional costs associated with ongoing compliance.

	        In August 2012, the regulation on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories (also known as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, or
	EMIR) became effective. Certain of the requirements of EMIR came into force in March 2013, and other obligations will be phased in. EMIR imposes a requirement that certain "standardized" OTC
	derivatives contracts are centrally cleared. Where OTC transactions are not subject to central clearing, techniques must be employed to monitor, measure and mitigate the operational and counterparty
	risks presented by the transaction. These risk mitigation techniques include trade confirmation, reconciliation processes, exchange of margin, and the daily mark-to-market of trades. EMIR also
	requires certain filings by market participants regarding OTC derivatives trades with central trade repositories. Certain of these risk mitigation obligations came into force on September 15,
	2013. Further, market participants will be required to report any European derivative contract to a central trade repository.




	        On
	July 17, 2013, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a final report setting out certain regulatory technical standards on contracts with a direct,
	substantial and foreseeable effect within the EU and non-evasion. These technical standards set out the circumstances in which EMIR's provisions on central clearing and risk mitigation techniques will
	apply to OTC derivatives by two non-EU counterparties. The imposition of these requirements could increase the cost of trading in the derivative markets, which could in turn make it more expensive and
	difficult for us or our funds to enter into swaps and other derivatives in the normal course of our business. Moreover, these increased regulatory responsibilities and increased costs could reduce
	trading levels in the derivative markets by a number of market participants, which could in turn adversely impact liquidity in the markets and expose our funds to greater risks in connection with
	their trading activities.




	        On
	September 3, 2013, ESMA also published its advice to the European Commission on the equivalence of EMIR with a number of third-country regimes. Based on this advice, the
	European Commission may make determinations that compliance with such third-country regimes will be deemed equivalent to compliance with EMIR on a recognition or "substituted compliance" basis.
	"Conditional" equivalence was proposed in relation to certain parts of the CFTC and SEC regimes whereby adherence to the relevant US regimes as well as a number of additional stipulations would deemed
	equivalent to EMIR. Ongoing regulatory uncertainty regarding the interaction between US and EU requirements for central clearing and related activities could result in duplicative regulatory
	obligations in the two jurisdictions, and could increase our costs of compliance.




	        The
	EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) entered into effect on July 22, 2013. AIFMD establishes a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory framework for
	alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs) managing and/or marketing alternative investment funds (AIFs) in the EU. The AIFMD imposes various substantive requirements to authorized
	AIFMs including rules on the structure of remuneration for certain personnel, a threshold for regulatory capital, reporting obligations in respect of controlled EU portfolio companies and
	increased transparency towards investors and regulators and allows authorized AIFMs to market AIFs to professional investors throughout the EU under an "EU passport". Available since July 2013
	to authorized EU AIFMs, the EU passport is expected to be available to authorized non-EU AIFMs from late 2015. In the meantime (and until at least 2018), non-EU AIFMs may continue to
	market within the EU under the private placement regimes of the individual member states subject to complying with certain minimum requirements imposed by the AIFMD and any additional requirements
	that individual member states may impose. The AIFMD will also impose a new, strict depositary regime affecting how prime brokers may provide custody services to fund managers.




	        Although
	many member states have now implemented the AIFMD, a number of member states did not meet the implementation deadline of July 22, 2013. Once authorized as an AIFM, the
	passport system should be available even where the host member has not transposed the AIFMD into national law. AIFMs in member states that have not yet implemented the AIFMD cannot rely on the
	marketing passport in other member states.

	        The
	AIFMD, the Level 2 Regulation and EU member state implementing measures could have an adverse effect on our businesses by, among other things, (i) imposing disclosure
	obligations and restrictions on distributions by EU portfolio companies of the funds we manage, (ii) significantly restricting marketing activities in the EU, (iii) potentially requiring
	changes in our compensation structures for key personnel, thereby potentially affecting our ability to recruit and retain these personnel, (iv) potentially in effect restricting our funds'
	investments in companies based in EU countries; (v) require us to restructure our operations and (vi) generally increasing our compliance costs. The AIFMD, the Level 2 Regulation
	and the EU member state implementing measures could limit, both in absolute terms and in comparison to EU-based investment managers and funds, our operating
	flexibility, our ability to market our funds, and our fund raising and investment opportunities, as well as expose us to conflicting regulatory requirements in the United States and the EU.




	        In
	October 2011, the European Commission published its proposed revisions to the existing Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (known as MiFID I), consisting of the revised
	directive MiFID II and a new related regulation, MiFIR. The proposed revisions are intended to further strengthen the EU regulatory framework for the provision of investment services and trading in
	financial instruments. A number of substantial reforms are proposed on transaction reporting, market structure, securities trading and conduct of business rules, including new regulatory equivalence
	requirements for third country firms in order for those firms to provide certain investment services in the EU. The MiFID II/MiFIR proposals are expected to be finalized and agreed by EU legislators
	by the first quarter of 2014 and to enter into effect in late 2014 at the earliest. It is currently expected that the majority of the provisions of MiFID II will come into force in member states
	during 2016. These regulations of investment firms is expected to increase the regulatory and operating costs of our affected businesses, particularly with regards to reporting requirements.




	        During
	the course of 2012, the EU has proposed or adopted a series of regulatory initiatives that may impact certain aspects of our business in EU member states. In March 2012, a
	regulation that limits sovereign and naked short selling of government bonds and stocks, the Short Selling Regulation, became effective. The Short Selling Regulation took effect on November 1,
	2012. In June 2012, the European Commission published a legislative proposal for a directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms. If
	and when adopted, the Directive will impose new obligations on covered institutions, including preparation of recovery and resolution plans, and give regulators wide-ranging powers. Revisions to the
	Markets in Financial Instruments Directive that were proposed in October 2011 are likely to be adopted in 2013 and are expected to result in new regulatory burdens, including a requirement to trade
	certain derivatives on regulated trading venues. In addition having an EU-regulated broker-dealer may bring other parts of our business, namely our investments in non-EU insurance brokers, within the
	scope of the EU's Financial Conglomerates Directive. If we were to become subject to these regulations, our business would become subject to capital adequacy requirements, additional reporting and
	disclosure requirements, a possible request by EU regulators to establish an EU based intermediate holding company controlling the EU based regulated entities and possible stress testing if requested
	by EU regulator. The imposition of these requirements could increase our and our funds' costs and the complexity of managing our business and may result in fines if we or any of our funds are deemed
	to have violated any of the new regulations.




	        On
	January 1, 2011, an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD III) entered into force. Among other things, CRD III requires EU member states to introduce
	stricter controls on remuneration for key employees and risk takers within specified credit institutions and investment firms. The Committee of European Banking Supervisors, or CEBS, published
	guidelines on the implementation of CRD III in December 2010. Also in December 2010, the UK Financial Services Authority, or FSA, amended its Remuneration Code to reflect CRD III. One of our
	subsidiaries established in the UK is subject to CRD III. CRD III required changes in our compensation structures

	Table of Contents





	for
	key personnel of this subsidiary, thereby potentially affecting its ability to recruit and retain these personnel.




	        In
	2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, an international body comprised of senior representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks from 27 countries,
	including the United States, finalized a comprehensive set of capital and liquidity standards, commonly referred to as "Basel III," for internationally active banking organizations. These new
	standards, which are expected to be fully phased in by 2019, are expected to require banks to hold more capital, predominantly in the form of common equity, than under the current capital framework.
	In July 2011, the European Commission published legislative proposals to implement Basel III's capital and liquidity standards by revising the existing Capital Requirements Directive and issuing a new
	Capital Requirements Regulation, collectively referred to as CRD IV, which came into force on January 1, 2014. CRD IV replaces the current CRD directive with new measures implementing the Basel
	III requirements, as well as creating a single harmonized prudential rule book for banks, introducing new corporate governance and a limited number of additional remuneration requirements, including
	an expected cap on variable remuneration, and enhancing the powers of regulators. In June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued proposed regulations that, among other things, would implement
	the Basel III capital framework in the United States. Compliance with the Basel III standards may result in significant costs to banks, which in turn may result in higher borrowing costs for the
	private sector and reduced access to certain types of credit. Basel III may increase the cost of borrowing by our funds and portfolio companies, which may result in fewer investments being acquired or
	disposed, lower returns, a decrease in valuations of our investments, or an inability to refinance debt on economic terms. See "Changes in the debt financing markets may negatively impact
	the ability of our private equity funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing for their investments and may increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could
	lead to lower yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income."




	        In
	October 2011 and November 2012, the Financial Stability Board, or FSB, issued reports that recommended strengthening the oversight and regulation of the so-called shadow banking
	system, broadly described as credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system. The report outlined initial steps to define the scope of the shadow banking
	system and proposed general governing principles for a monitoring and regulatory framework. The FSB published final recommendations for the regulation and oversight of shadow banking in August 2013.
	Building on the work of the FSB, a Money Market Funds (MMF) Regulation has been proposed by the European Commission to address such concerns. The key provisions of the proposed MMF Regulation include
	prescribed levels of daily and weekly liquidity, a capital buffer of 3% for constant net asset value funds, internal risk credit risk assessment to be carried out by the MMF manager to avoid reliance
	on external credit-ratings, and clear labels to distinguish between standard and short-term MMFs (with residual maturity not exceeding 297 days). While the MMF Regulation has not yet been
	finalized, based on the current proposals it is likely to extend the regulatory and supervisory requirements, such that the regulatory and operating costs of our affected businesses would increase and
	may become prohibitive.




	        We
	regularly rely on exemptions in the United States from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act, the Commodity Exchange Act and the
	U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, in conducting our investment management activities. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances
	depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us, we could become subject to additional restrictive and costly
	registration requirements, regulatory action, or third party claims and our business could be materially and adversely affected. For example, in raising new funds, we typically rely on private
	placement exemptions from registration under the Securities Act, including Regulation D, which was




	60











	Table of Contents





	recently
	amended to prohibit issuers (including our funds) from relying on certain of the exemptions from registration if the fund or any of its "covered persons" (including certain officers and
	directors, but also including certain third parties including, among others, promoters, placement agents and beneficial owners of 20% of outstanding voting securities of the fund) has been the subject
	of a "disqualifying event," or a "bad actor," which can include a variety of criminal, regulatory and civil matters. If any of the covered persons associated with our funds is subject to a
	disqualifying event, one or more of our funds could lose the ability to raise capital in a Rule 506 private offering for a significant period of time, which could significantly impair our
	ability to raise new funds, and, therefore, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if certain of our employees or any potential
	significant investor has been the subject of a disqualifying event, we could be required to reassign or terminate such an employee or we could be required to refuse the investment of such an investor,
	which could impair our relationships with investors, harm our reputation, or make it more difficult to raise new funds. See also "Risks Related to Our Organizational
	StructureIf we were deemed to be an "investment company" subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our
	business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business."




	        On
	the other hand, we are and will become further subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as we expand our product offerings and investment platform to include retail
	investors. For example, funds in our Public Markets segment are registered under the Investment Company Act as management investment companies. These funds and KKR Asset Management LLC, which
	serves as their investment adviser (or in the case of the business development company, as its sub-adviser), are subject to the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder, which, among other
	things, regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and its investment adviser and prohibit or severely restrict principal transactions and joint transactions. As our business
	expands we may be required to make additional registrations, including in jurisdictions outside the U.S. Compliance with these rules will increase our compliance costs and create potential for
	additional liabilities and penalties the management of which would divert management's attention from our business and investments.




	        Other
	requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in our funds and are not designed to protect
	holders of interests in our business. Consequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities. For
	example, federal bank regulatory agencies have issued leveraged lending guidance covering transactions characterized by a degree of financial leverage. To the extent that such guidance limits the
	amount or cost of financing we are able to obtain for our transactions, the returns on our investments may suffer. In addition, the regulatory environment in which our funds or their investors operate
	may affect our business. For example, changes in antitrust laws or the enforcement of antitrust laws could affect the level of mergers and acquisitions activity, and changes in state or other local
	laws may limit investment activities of state pension plans or insurance companies. We may also be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC or
	other governmental regulatory authorities including foreign regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets.




	        We
	are also subject to a number of laws and regulations governing payments and contributions to political persons or other third parties, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign
	Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, as well as trade sanctions and other export control laws administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S.
	Department of State. The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign governments and their officials and political parties, and requires public companies in the United States to keep books and
	records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies' transactions. OFAC, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State administer and enforce various export control laws and
	regulations, including




	61











	Table of Contents





	economic
	and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. These laws and regulations relate to a number of
	aspects of our business, including servicing existing fund investors, finding new fund investors, and sourcing new investments, as well as activities by the portfolio companies in our investment
	portfolio or other controlled investments.




	        The
	Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012 ("ITRA") expands the scope of U.S. sanctions against Iran. Notably, ITRA prohibits foreign entities that are majority owned
	or controlled by U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with Iran that would be contrary to the sanctions regulations if undertaken by a U.S. person. In addition, Section 219 of the ITRA
	amended the Exchange Act to require public reporting companies to disclose in their annual or quarterly reports any dealings or transactions the company or its affiliates engaged in during the
	previous reporting period involving Iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain OFAC sanctions. In some cases, ITRA requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if
	they were permissible under U.S. law or were conducted outside of the United States by a foreign affiliate. To our knowledge, none of our activities during the year ended December 31, 2013, are
	required to be disclosed pursuant to ITRA, except for certain activities of portfolio companies, as disclosed in Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report. We are required to separately file,
	concurrently with this annual report, a notice that such activities have been disclosed in this annual report. The SEC is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report
	to the U.S. President and certain U.S. Congressional committees. The U.S. President thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and, within 180 days of initiating such an investigation,
	to determine whether sanctions should be imposed. Disclosure of such
	activity, even if such activity is not subject to sanctions under applicable law, and any sanctions actually imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities, could harm our reputation
	and have a negative impact on our business.




	        Similar
	laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as EU sanctions or the U.K. Bribery Act, as well as other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, or sanction or
	other export control laws in the U.S. and abroad, may also impose stricter or more onerous requirements than the FCPA, OFAC, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of State, and
	implementing them may disrupt our business or cause us to incur significantly more costs to comply with those laws. Different laws may also contain conflicting provisions, making compliance with all
	laws more difficult. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm, incarceration of our employees,
	restrictions on our operations and other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may be subject to successor liability for
	FCPA violations or other acts of bribery committed by companies in which we or our funds invest or which we or our funds acquire.




	        In
	June 2010, the SEC approved Rule 206(4)-5 under the Advisers Act regarding "pay to play" practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to
	government clients and elected officials able to exert influence on such clients. Among other restrictions, the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to
	a government client for two years, subject to very limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities
	make contributions to certain candidates and officials in position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government client. Advisers are required to implement compliance policies
	designed, among other matters, to track contributions by certain of the adviser's employees and engagements of third parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records in order to
	enable the SEC to determine compliance with the rule. There has also been similar rule-making on a state-level regarding "pay to play" practices by investment advisers, including in California and New
	York. Any failure on our part to comply with




	62











	Table of Contents





	these
	rules could cause us to lose compensation for our advisory services or expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage.




	        Certain
	laws to which we are subject, such as certain environmental laws, takeover laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, escheat or abandoned property laws, and antitrust laws,
	may impose requirements on us and our portfolio companies as an affiliated group and, in some cases, impose concepts such as joint and several liability or notification obligations on affiliates. For
	example, the United Kingdom introduced a CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme which requires, under certain circumstances, that funds, general partners and portfolio companies participate in the scheme as a
	single organization and aggregate the energy supplies made to each of them. In addition, the scheme imposes joint and several liability for compliance on the entities within the organization.
	Moreover,
	certain non-U.S. jurisdictions may seek to make us liable for the anti-trust violations, if any, committed by certain of our portfolio companies. Similarly, our portfolio companies may be subject to
	contractual obligations which may impose obligations or restrictions on their affiliates. The interpretation of such contractual provisions will depend on local laws. Given that we do not control all
	of our portfolio companies and that our portfolio companies generally operate independently of each other, there is a risk that we could contravene one or more of such laws, regulations and
	contractual arrangements due to limited access and opportunities to monitor compliance. In addition, compliance with these laws or contracts could require us to commit significant resources and
	capital towards information gathering and monitoring thereby increasing our operating costs.




	        Our
	operations are subject to regulation and supervision in a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions, and the level of regulation and supervision to which we are subject varies
	from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activity involved. See "BusinessRegulation."






	The potential requirement to convert our financial statements from being prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	to International Financial Reporting Standards may materially strain our resources and materially increase our annual expenses.






	        The SEC may require in the future that we report our financial results under International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS,
	instead of under U.S. GAAP. IFRS is a set of accounting principles that has been gaining acceptance on a worldwide basis. These standards are published by the London-based International
	Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and are more focused on objectives and principles and less reliant on detailed rules than U.S. GAAP. Today, there remain significant and material differences
	in several key areas between U.S. GAAP and IFRS which would affect us if we were required to prepare financial statements in conformity with IFRS. Additionally, U.S. GAAP provides
	specific guidance in classes of accounting transactions for which equivalent guidance in IFRS does not exist. The adoption of IFRS is highly complex and would have an impact on many aspects and
	operations of KKR, including but not limited to financial accounting and reporting systems, internal controls, taxes, borrowing covenants and cash management. It is expected that a significant amount
	of time, internal and external resources and expenses over a multi-year period would be required for this conversion.






	We are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and
	negative publicity.






	        The investment decisions we make in our investment management business and the activities of our investment professionals on behalf of
	our portfolio companies may subject them and us to the risk of third-party litigation arising from dissatisfaction of fund investors with the performance of their funds, the activities of our
	portfolio companies and a variety of other litigation claims. See the section entitled "Litigation" appearing in Note 15 "Commitments and
	Contingencies" of our financial statements included elsewhere in this report. By way of example, we, our funds and certain of our employees are each exposed to the risks of litigation relating to
	investment activities of our funds and




	63











	Table of Contents





	actions
	taken by the officers and directors (some of whom may be KKR employees) of portfolio companies, such as the risk of shareholder litigation by other shareholders of public companies or holders
	of debt instruments of companies in which our funds have significant investments. We are also exposed to risks of litigation or investigation in the event of any transactions that presented conflicts
	of interest that were not properly addressed.




	        To
	the extent investors in our investment funds suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, such investors may have remedies
	against us, our investment funds, our principals or our affiliates under federal securities law and state law. Investors in our funds do not have legal remedies against us, the general partners of our
	funds, our funds, our principals or our affiliates solely based on their dissatisfaction with the investment performance of those funds. While the general partners and investment advisers to our
	investment funds, including their directors, officers, other employees and affiliates, are generally indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by law with respect to their conduct in connection with
	the management of the business and affairs of our investment funds, such indemnity generally does not extend to actions determined to have involved fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other
	similar misconduct.




	        In
	addition, we have formed and may continue to form funds targeting retail investors, which may subject us to additional risk of litigation and regulatory scrutiny.
	See"Extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus or
	legislative or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business."




	        If
	any civil or criminal lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability or culpability, the lawsuit could materially adversely affect our
	business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously impact our business. We depend to a large extent on our business
	relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain fund investors and qualified professionals and to pursue investment opportunities for our
	funds. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press
	speculation about us, our investment activities or the private equity industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to other types
	of businesses.




	        In
	addition, with a workforce composed of many highly paid professionals, we face the risk of litigation relating to claims for compensation or other damages, which may, individually or
	in the aggregate, be significant in amount. The cost of settling any such claims could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.






	Misconduct of our employees or at our portfolio companies could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal
	liability and reputational harm.






	        There is a risk that our principals and employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. We are subject to a
	number of obligations and standards arising from our business and our authority over the assets we manage. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees would adversely
	affect our clients and us. We may also be adversely affected if there is misconduct by senior management of portfolio companies in which our funds invest, even though we may be unable to control or
	mitigate such misconduct. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which we may invest. If our employees were improperly to use or
	disclose confidential information, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships, as well as face potentially significant litigation.
	It is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If any of our employees or the




	64











	Table of Contents





	employees
	of portfolio companies were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected.






	Underwriting activities expose us to risks.






	        KKR Capital Markets LLC, a subsidiary of ours, may act as an underwriter in securities offerings. We may incur losses and be
	subject to reputational harm to the extent that, for any reason, we are unable to sell securities or indebtedness we purchased as an underwriter at the anticipated price levels. As an underwriter, we
	also are subject to potential liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite.






	We are subject to risks in using prime brokers, custodians, administrators and other agents.






	        Certain of our investment funds and our Capital Markets and Principal Activities business depend on the services of prime brokers,
	custodians, administrators and other agents to carry out certain securities transactions. In the event of the insolvency of a prime broker and/or custodian, our funds may not be able to recover
	equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the prime broker's and custodian's unsecured creditors in relation to assets which the prime broker or custodian borrows, lends or otherwise uses. In
	addition, our and our funds' cash held with a prime broker or custodian may not be segregated from the prime broker's or custodian's own cash, and our funds therefore may rank as unsecured creditors
	in relation thereto. The inability to recover assets from the prime broker or custodian could have a material impact on the performance of our funds and our business, financial condition and results
	of operations.





	Risks Related to the Assets We Manage





	        As an investment manager, we sponsor and manage funds that make investments worldwide on behalf of third-party investors and, in
	connection with those activities, are required to deploy our own capital in those investments. The investments of these funds are subject to many risks and uncertainties which, to the extent they are
	material, are discussed below. In addition, we have principal investments and manage those assets on our own behalf. As a result, the gains and losses on such assets are reflected in our net income
	and the risks set forth below relating to the assets that we manage will directly affect our operating performance.






	The historical returns attributable to our funds, including those presented in this report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of
	our future results or of any returns on our common units.






	        We have presented in this report certain information relating to our investment returns, such as net and gross IRRs, multiples of
	invested capital and realized and unrealized investment values for funds that we have sponsored and managed. The historical and potential future returns of the funds that we manage are not directly
	linked to returns on KKR Group Partnership Units.




	        Moreover,
	historical returns of our funds may not be indicative of the future results that you should expect from us, which could negatively impact the fees and incentive amounts
	received by us from such
	funds. In particular, our funds' future results may differ significantly from their historical results including for the following reasons:






	




	the rates of returns of our funds reflect unrealized gains as of the applicable valuation date that may never be realized,
	which may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from those funds' investments;






	65

























	Table of Contents







	




	the historical returns that we present in this report derive largely from the performance of our earlier private equity
	funds, whereas future fund returns will depend increasingly on the performance of our newer funds, which may have little or no investment track record, and in particular you will not benefit from any
	value that was created in our funds prior to the KPE Transaction to the extent such value has been realized and we may be required to repay excess amounts previously received in respect of carried
	interest in our funds if, upon liquidation of the fund, we have received carried interest distributions in excess of the amount to which we were entitled;








	




	the future performance of our funds will be affected by macroeconomic factors, including negative factors arising from
	disruptions in the global financial markets that were not prevalent in the periods relevant to the historical return data included in this report;








	




	in some historical periods, the rates of return of some of our funds have been positively influenced by a number of
	investments that experienced a substantial decrease in the average holding period of such investments and rapid and substantial increases in value following the dates on which those investments were
	made; the actual or expected length of holding periods related to investments is likely longer than such historical periods; those trends and rates of return may not be repeated in the future;








	




	our newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period that they take to deploy their capital;








	




	our funds' returns have benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions in certain historical
	periods that may not repeat themselves, and there can be no assurance that our current or future funds will be able to avail themselves of comparable investment opportunities or market conditions; and








	




	we may create new funds and investment products in the future that reflect a different asset mix in terms of allocations
	among funds, investment strategies, geographic and industry exposure, vintage year and economic terms.






	        In
	addition, our historical rates of return reflect our historical cost structure, which has varied and may vary further in the future. Certain of our newer funds, for example, have
	lower fee structures and also have performance hurdles. Future returns will also be affected by the risks described elsewhere in this report, including risks of the industry sectors and businesses in
	which a particular fund invests and changes in laws. See "Risks Related to our BusinessDifficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including
	by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash
	flow and adversely affect our financial condition."






	Valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can be subjective and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized,
	which could result in significant losses for our funds.






	        There are no readily ascertainable market prices for a substantial majority of illiquid investments of our investment funds and our
	finance vehicles. When determining fair values of investments, we use the last reported market price as of the statement of financial condition date for
	investments that have readily observable market prices. When an investment does not have a readily available market price, the fair value of the investment represents the value, as determined by us in
	good faith, at which the investment could be sold in an orderly disposition over a reasonable period of time between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale. There is no single
	standard for determining fair value in good faith and in many cases fair value is best expressed as a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived. When making fair value
	determinations for our private equity




	66











	Table of Contents





	investments,
	we typically use a market multiples approach that considers a specified financial measure (such as EBITDA) and/or a discounted cash flow analysis. To value our energy and infrastructure
	investments, we generally utilize a discounted cash flow analysis, while we use a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis to value our real estate investments.
	Credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not available, credit investments are valued by us based on ranges of valuations
	determined by an independent valuation firm. Each of these methodologies requires estimates of key inputs and significant assumptions and judgments. We also consider a range of additional factors that
	we deem relevant, including the applicability of a control premium or illiquidity discount, the presence of significant unconsolidated assets and liabilities, any favorable or unfavorable tax
	attributes, the method of likely exit, financial projections, estimates of assumed growth rates, terminal values, discount rates including risk free rates, capital structure, risk premiums and other
	factors, and determining these factors may involve a significant degree of our management's judgment and the judgment of management of our portfolio companies. Changes in these factors can have a
	significant effect on the results of the valuation methodologies used to value our portfolio, and our reported fair values for these assets could vary materially if the inputs and other assumptions
	used from prior quarters were to change significantly. For example, if applicable interest rates rise, then the assumed cost of capital for these assets would be expected to increase under a
	discounted cash flow analysis, and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors. Conversely, a fall in interest rates would be expected to positively impact
	valuations of these assets if not offset by other factors. As a result of the significant assumptions underlying our valuations, our valuations may differ from those of other investors holding the
	identical investment that we hold.




	        Because
	valuations, and in particular valuations of investments for which market quotations are not readily available, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time
	and may be based on estimates, determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if a ready market had existed. Even if market quotations are available for
	our investments, such quotations may not reflect the value that we would actually be able to realize because of various factors, including possible illiquidity associated with a large ownership
	position, subsequent illiquidity in the market for a company's securities, future market price volatility or the potential for a future loss in market value based on poor industry conditions or the
	market's view of overall company and management performance. Our partners' capital could be adversely affected if the values of investments that we record is materially higher than the values that are
	ultimately realized upon the disposal of the investments and changes in values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in our AUM and such changes could materially
	affect the results of operations that we report from period to period. There can be no assurance that the investment values that we record from time
	to time will ultimately be realized and that you will be able to realize the investment values that are presented in this report.




	        Because
	there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair values of investments reflected in an investment fund's
	or finance vehicle's net asset value, or NAV, do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained by us on behalf of the fund or finance vehicle when such investments are realized.
	Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior fund NAVs would result in losses for the applicable fund and the loss of potential carried
	interest and other fees. Also, if realizations of our investments produce values materially different than the carrying values reflected in prior fund NAVs, fund investors may lose confidence in us,
	which could in turn result in difficulty in raising capital for future funds.




	        In
	addition, because we value our entire portfolio only on a quarterly basis, subsequent events that may have a material impact on those valuations may not be reflected until the next
	quarterly valuation date.

	Dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.






	        Because many of our funds' investments rely heavily on the use of leverage, our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on
	investments will depend on our continued ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. For example, our credit funds use varying degrees of leverage when making
	investments. Similarly, in many private equity investments, indebtedness may constitute 70% or more of a portfolio company's total debt and equity capitalization, including debt that may be incurred
	in connection with the investment, and a portfolio company's indebtedness may also increase in recapitalization transactions subsequent to the company's acquisition. The absence of available sources
	of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time could therefore materially and adversely affect our funds and our portfolio companies. Also, an increase in either the general levels of
	interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness such as we experienced during 2009 would make it more expensive to finance those investments. In addition, increases in
	interest rates could decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investments that our finance vehicles or our funds make. Increases in interest rates could also make it more difficult to locate and
	consummate private equity and other investments because other potential buyers, including operating companies acting as strategic buyers, may be able to bid for an asset at a higher price due to a
	lower overall cost of capital or their ability to benefit from a higher amount of cost savings following the acquisition of the asset. In addition, a portion of the indebtedness used to finance
	private equity investments often includes high-yield debt securities issued in the capital markets. Capital markets are
	volatile, and there may be times when we might not be able to access those markets at attractive rates, or at all, when completing an investment.




	        Investments
	in highly leveraged entities are also inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry
	developments. The incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:






	




	subject the entity to a number of restrictive covenants, terms and conditions, any violation of which would be viewed by
	creditors as an event of default and could materially impact our ability to realize value from our investment;








	




	allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render it unable to service its indebtedness;








	




	give rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow, which might limit the entity's
	ability to respond to changing industry conditions to the extent additional cash is needed for the response, to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth
	opportunities;








	




	limit the entity's ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage
	compared to its competitors who have relatively less debt;








	




	limit the entity's ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or
	further growth; and








	




	limit the entity's ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for
	capital expenditures, working capital or other general corporate purposes.






	        A
	leveraged company's income and equity also tend to increase or decrease at a greater rate than would otherwise be the case if money had not been borrowed. As a result, the risk of loss
	associated with a leveraged company is generally greater than for comparable companies with comparatively less debt. For example, leveraged companies could default on their debt obligations due to a
	decrease in




	68











	Table of Contents





	revenues
	and cash flow precipitated by an economic downturn or by poor relative performance at such a company.




	        When
	our funds' existing portfolio investments reach the point when debt incurred to finance those investments matures in significant amounts and must be either repaid or refinanced,
	those investments may materially suffer if they have generated insufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt and there is insufficient capacity and availability in the financing markets to permit them
	to refinance maturing debt on satisfactory terms, or at all. If the financing for such purposes were to be unavailable or uneconomic when significant amounts of the debt incurred to finance our funds'
	existing portfolio investments start to come due, these investments could be materially and adversely affected. In the event of default or potential default under applicable financing arrangements,
	one or more of our portfolio companies may go bankrupt, which could give rise to substantial investment losses, adverse claims or litigation against us or our employees and damage to our reputation.




	        The
	majority-owned subsidiaries of KFN regularly use and have used significant leverage to finance their assets. An inability by such subsidiaries to continue to raise or utilize
	leverage, to refinance or extend the maturities of their outstanding indebtedness or to maintain adequate levels of collateral under the terms of their collateralized loan obligations could limit
	their ability to grow their business, reinvest principal cash, distribute cash to KFN or fully execute their business strategy, and KFN's results of operations may be adversely affected. If KFN is
	unable to maintain its operating results and access to capital resources, KFN could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet its
	debt service and other obligations. If we complete our merger with KFN, we may experience similar problems.




	        Among
	the sectors particularly challenged by downturns in the global credit markets, including the downturn experienced from 2008 through 2010, are the CLO and leveraged finance markets.
	KFN has, and if we complete our merger with KFN, we will have significant exposure to these markets through its CLO subsidiaries, each of which is a special purpose company that issued to KFN and
	other investors notes secured by a pool of collateral consisting primarily of corporate leveraged loans. In most cases, KFN's CLO holdings are deeply subordinated, representing the CLO subsidiary's
	substantial leverage, which increases both the opportunity for higher returns as well as the magnitude of losses when compared to holders or investors that rank more senior to KFN in right of payment.
	KFN's CLO subsidiaries have historically experienced an increase in downgrades, depreciations in market value and defaults in respect of leveraged loans in their collateral during downturns in credit
	markets. There can
	be no assurance that market conditions giving rise to these types of consequences will not occur, re-occur, subsist or become more acute in the future. Because KFN's CLO structures involve complex
	collateral and other arrangements, the documentation for such structures is complex, is subject to differing interpretations and involves legal risk. In July 2009, KFN surrendered for cancellation
	approximately $298.4 million in aggregate of notes issued to it by certain of its CLOs. The surrendered notes were cancelled and the obligations due under such notes were deemed extinguished.




	        Our
	hedge fund-of-funds, long/short equity fund, long/short credit fund, other credit- oriented funds and CLOs may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs
	and regularly borrow a substantial amount of their capital. The use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss in the value of the investment
	portfolio. A fund may borrow money from time to time to purchase or carry securities or debt obligations or may enter into derivative transactions (such as total return swaps) with counterparties that
	have embedded leverage. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by appreciation in the securities purchased or carried and will be
	lostand the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbatedin the event of a decline in the market value of such securities or debt obligations. Gains
	realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund's net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. However, if




	69











	Table of Contents





	investment
	results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund's net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings.




	        Any
	of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.






	The due diligence process that we undertake in connection with our investments may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment.






	        Before making our investments, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances
	applicable to each investment. The objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances surrounding an investment, to identify
	possible risks associated with that investment and, in the case of private equity investments, to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement
	and value creation. When conducting due diligence, we typically evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to
	proceed with an investment. Outside
	consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due
	diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, we rely on resources available to us, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third-party
	investigations. The due diligence process may at times be subjective with respect to newly organized companies for which only limited information is available.




	        Instances
	of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be
	widespread in certain jurisdictions. Several of our funds invest in emerging market countries that may not have established laws and regulations that are as stringent as in more developed nations, or
	where existing laws and regulations may not be consistently enforced. For example, our funds invest throughout jurisdictions that have material perceptions of corruption according to international
	rating standards (such as "Transparency International" and "Corruption Perceptions Index") such as China, India, Indonesia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Due diligence on investment
	opportunities in these jurisdictions is frequently more complicated because consistent and uniform commercial practices in such locations may not have developed. Bribery, fraud, accounting
	irregularities and corrupt practices can be especially difficult to detect in such locations.




	        The
	due diligence conducted for certain of our Public Markets strategies is limited to publicly available information. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that the due diligence
	investigation that we will carry out with respect to any investment opportunity will reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities and contingent
	liabilities) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity, including the existence of contingent liabilities. We also cannot be certain that our due diligence
	investigations will result in investments being successful or that the actual financial performance of an investment will not fall short of the financial projections we used when evaluating that
	investment.




	        When
	we conduct due diligence in making and monitoring investments in third party hedge funds, we rely on information supplied by third party hedge funds or by service providers to such
	third party hedge funds. The information we receive from them may not be accurate or complete and therefore we may not have all the relevant facts necessary to properly assess and monitor our funds'
	investment in a particular hedge fund.

	Our investment management activities involve investments in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets, and we may fail to realize any profits from these activities for a
	considerable period of time or lose some or all of the capital invested.






	        Many of our funds hold investments in securities that are not publicly traded. In many cases, our funds may be prohibited by contract
	or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities at many points in time. Our funds will generally not be able to sell these securities publicly unless their sale is registered under
	applicable securities laws, or unless an exemption from such registration is available, and then only at such times when we do not possess material nonpublic information. The ability of many of our
	funds to dispose of investments is heavily dependent on the capital markets and in particular the public equity markets. For example, the ability to realize any value from an investment may depend
	upon the ability to complete an initial public offering of the portfolio company in which such investment is made. Even if the securities are publicly traded, large holdings of securities can often be
	disposed of only over a substantial length of time, exposing our investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the intended disposition period. In addition, as certain of
	our funds have a finite term, we could be forced to dispose of investments sooner than otherwise desirable. Accordingly, under certain conditions, our funds may be forced to either sell securities at
	lower prices than they had expected to realize or defer sales that they had planned to make, potentially for a considerable period of time. We have made and expect to continue to make significant
	capital investments in our current and future funds. Contributing capital to these funds is risky, and we may lose some or all of the principal amount of our investments.






	The investments of our funds are subject to a number of inherent risks.






	        Our results are highly dependent on our continued ability to generate attractive returns from our investments. Investments made by our
	private equity, credit or other investments involve a number of significant risks inherent to private equity, credit and other investing, including the
	following:






	




	companies in which investments are made may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations
	under their securities, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of their equity securities or any collateral or guarantees provided with respect to their debt;








	




	companies in which investments are made are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group
	of persons and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of those persons could have a material adverse impact on their business and prospects;








	




	companies in which investments are made may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing
	businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive
	position;








	




	instances of bribery, fraud and other deceptive practices committed by senior management of portfolio companies in which
	our funds invest may undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such companies, and if such fraud is discovered, negatively affect the valuation of a fund's investments as well as contribute
	to overall market volatility that can negatively impact a fund's investment program;








	




	our funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is
	dissolved, either by expiration of such fund's term or otherwise, resulting in a lower than expected return on the investments and, potentially, on the fund itself;






	71

























	Table of Contents







	




	our portfolio companies generally have capital structures established on the basis of financial projections based
	primarily on management judgments and assumptions, and general economic conditions and other factors may cause actual performance to fall short of these financial projections, which could cause a
	substantial decrease in the value of our equity holdings in the portfolio company and cause our funds' performance to fall short of our expectations;








	




	executive officers, directors and employees of an equity sponsor may be named as defendants in litigation involving a
	company in which an investment is made or is being made, and we or our funds may indemnify such executive officers, directors or employees for liability relating to such litigation;








	




	we or certain of our investment funds could potentially be held liable under ERISA for the pension obligations of one or
	more of our portfolio companies if we or the investment fund were determined to be a "trade or business" under ERISA and deemed part of the same "controlled group" as the portfolio company under such
	rules, and the pension obligations of any particular portfolio company could be material. In a recent decision of a federal appellate court (



	Sun Capital Partners III LP
	v. New England Teamsters & Trucking Indus. Pension Fund



	), a private equity firm was held to be engaged in a "trade or business" under ERISA;








	




	we advise funds that invest in businesses that operate in a variety of industries that are subject to extensive domestic
	and foreign regulation (including companies that supply services to governmental agencies), such as the telecommunications industry, the defense and government services industry, the healthcare
	industry and oil and gas industry, that may involve greater risk due to rapidly changing market and governmental conditions in those sectors; and








	




	significant failures of our portfolio companies to comply with laws and regulations applicable to them could affect the
	ability of our funds to invest in other companies in certain industries in the future and could harm our reputation;








	Our investments in real assets such as real estate, infrastructure assets and energy may expose us to increased risks and liabilities and may expose our unitholders to
	adverse tax consequences.






	        Investments in real assets, which may include real estate, infrastructure assets, oil and gas properties and other energy, may expose
	us to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership of real assets. For example, ownership of real assets in our funds or vehicles may increase our risk of liability under
	environmental laws that impose, regardless of fault, joint and several liability for the cost of remediating contamination and compensation for damages. Ownership of real assets may also present
	additional risk of liability for personal and property injury or impose significant operating challenges and costs, for example with respect to compliance with zoning, environmental or other
	applicable laws.




	        Without
	limiting the foregoing disclosure, we note that investments that we have made and will continue to make in the oil and gas industries may present specific environmental, safety
	and other inherent risks, and such investments are subject to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations specific to oil and gas industries, for example
	governing controls, taxes, transportation of oil and natural gas, exploration and production, permitting, and various conservation laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas production and
	related operations in addition to regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to
	comply with applicable laws
	and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations
	in affected areas. These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production

	below
	the rate that would otherwise be possible and increase the cost of production thus reducing profitability. Our oil and gas investments are subject to other risks, such
	as:






	




	Currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may
	be discovered making it difficult to predict the future costs or impact of compliance.








	




	The oil and gas industries present inherent risk of personal and property injury, for which we may not be fully insured.








	




	Our estimated oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids reserve quantities and future production rates are based on many
	assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or the underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and value of our reserves.








	




	The performance of our energy investments depend on the skill, ability and decisions of third party operators. Failure of
	such operators to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could result in liabilities to us, reduce the value of our interest in the oil and natural gas properties, adversely affect our
	cash flows and results of operations.








	




	If commodity prices decline and remain depressed for a prolonged period, a significant portion of our development projects
	may become uneconomic and cause write downs of the value of our oil and natural gas properties, which may reduce the value of our energy investments, have a negative impact on our ability to use these
	investments as collateral or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.






	        Investments
	in real estate will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and real estate related businesses and assets. These risks include those
	associated with the burdens of ownership of real property, general and local economic conditions, changes in supply of and demand for competing properties in an area (as a result, for instance, of
	overbuilding), fluctuations in the average occupancy, the financial resources of tenants, changes in building, environmental and other laws, energy and supply shortages, various uninsured or
	uninsurable risks, natural disasters, changes in government regulations (such as rent control), changes in real property tax rates, changes in interest rates, the reduced availability of mortgage
	funds which may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable, negative developments in the economy that depress travel activity, environmental liabilities, contingent
	liabilities on disposition of assets, terrorist attacks, war and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, if we acquire direct or indirect interests in undeveloped land or
	underdeveloped real property, which may often be non-income producing, they will be subject to the risks normally associated with such assets and development activities, including risks relating to
	the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory or environmental approvals, the cost and timely completion of construction (including risks beyond the control of our fund, such as
	weather or labor conditions or material shortages) and the availability of both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms.




	        In
	addition, investments in real assets may cause adverse tax consequences for certain non-U.S. unitholders regarding income effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or
	business and the imposition of certain tax withholding. Please see "Risks Related to U.S. TaxationNon-U.S. persons face unique U.S. tax issues from owning our common units
	that may result in adverse tax consequences to them". Moreover, investments in real assets may also require all our unitholders to file tax returns and pay taxes in various state and local
	jurisdictions in the U.S. and abroad where these real assets are located. Please see "Risks Related to U.S. TaxationHolders of our common units may be subject to state, local and foreign
	taxes and return filing requirements as a result of owning such common units".

	Certain of our investment funds may invest in securities of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, including companies involved in
	bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. Such investments may be subject to a greater risk of poor performance or loss.






	        Certain of our investment funds, especially in our special situations strategy, may invest in business enterprises involved in
	work-outs, liquidations, reorganizations, bankruptcies and similar transactions and may purchase high risk receivables. An investment in such business enterprises entails the risk that the transaction
	in which such business enterprise is involved
	either will be unsuccessful, will take considerable time or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security the value of which will be less than the purchase price to the fund of the security
	or other financial instrument in respect of which such distribution is received. In addition, if an anticipated transaction does not in fact occur, the fund may be required to sell its investment at a
	loss. Investments in troubled companies may also be adversely affected by U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws relating to, among other things, fraudulent conveyances, voidable preferences, lender
	liability and a bankruptcy court's discretionary power to disallow, subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims. Investments in securities and private claims of troubled companies made in
	connection with an attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in a bankruptcy case may also involve substantial litigation, which has the potential to adversely impact us
	or unrelated funds or portfolio companies. Because there is substantial uncertainty concerning the outcome of transactions involving financially troubled companies, there is a potential risk of loss
	by a fund of its entire investment in such company.






	Our investment in Nephila is exposed to natural catastrophe and weather risk.






	        Our investment in Nephila, an investment manager focused on investing in natural catastrophe and weather risk, is exposed to a risk of
	reduced revenues resulting from natural disasters. Because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable, historical results of operations of Nephila may not be indicative of its future
	results of operations. As a result of the occurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period, the expected returns from this investment may fall short of our expectations.






	We often pursue investment opportunities that involve business, regulatory, legal or other complexities.






	        As an element of our investment style, we often pursue complex investment opportunities. This can often take the form of substantial
	business, regulatory or legal complexity that would deter other investment managers. Our tolerance for complexity presents risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and
	time-consuming to finance and execute; it can be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions; and such transactions sometimes entail a higher level of
	regulatory scrutiny, the application of complex tax laws or a greater risk of contingent liabilities. We may cause our funds to acquire an investment that is subject to contingent liabilities, which
	could be unknown to us at the time of acquisition or, if they are known to us, we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks that they present. Acquired contingent liabilities could thus
	result in unforeseen losses for our funds. In addition, in connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company, a fund may be required to make representations about the business
	and financial affairs of such portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. A fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the
	extent that any such representations are inaccurate. These arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities by a fund, even after the disposition of an investment. Any of these
	risks could harm the performance of our funds.

	Our private equity investments are typically among the largest in the industry, which involves certain complexities and risks that are not encountered in small- and
	medium-sized investments.






	        Our private equity funds make investments in companies with relatively large capitalizations, which involves certain complexities and
	risks that are not encountered in small-and medium-sized investments. For example, larger transactions may be more difficult to finance and exiting larger deals may present incremental challenges. In
	addition, larger transactions may pose greater challenges in implementing changes in the company's management, culture, finances or operations, and may entail greater scrutiny by regulators, interest
	groups and other third parties. These constituencies may be more active in opposing some larger investments by certain private equity firms.




	        In
	some transactions, the amount of equity capital that is required to complete a large capitalization private equity transaction may be significant and are required to be structured as
	a consortium transaction. A consortium transaction involves an equity investment in which two or more other private equity firms serve together or collectively as equity sponsors. While we have sought
	to limit where possible the amount of consortium transactions in which we have been involved, we have participated in a significant number of those transactions. Consortium transactions generally
	entail a reduced level of control by our firm over the investment because governance rights must be shared with the other consortium investors. Accordingly, we may not be able to control decisions
	relating to a consortium investment, including decisions relating to the management and operation of the company and the timing and nature of any exit, which could result in the risks described in
	"Our funds have made investments in companies that we do not control, exposing us to the risk of decisions made by others with which we may not agree." Any of these factors could increase
	the risk that our larger investments could be less successful. The consequences to our investment funds of an unsuccessful larger investment could be more severe given the size of the investment.






	We and our funds have made investments in companies that we do not control, exposing us to the risk of decisions made by others with which we may not agree.






	        Our funds and accounts hold investments that include debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control and
	such investments may comprise an increasing part of our business. Such instruments and securities may be acquired by our funds and accounts through trading activities or through purchases of
	securities from the issuer. In addition, our funds and accounts may acquire minority equity interests, particularly when making private equity investments in Asia or sponsoring investments as part of
	a large investor consortium, and may also
	dispose of a portion of their majority equity investments in portfolio companies over time in a manner that results in the funds or accounts retaining a minority investment. We have made certain
	minority investments in publicly traded companies. These transactions could be viewed as unwanted, damage our reputation, and consequently impair our ability to source transactions in the future.
	Those investments will be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority
	stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. If any of the foregoing were to occur, the value of the investments by our
	funds or accounts could decrease and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our investments in our Public Markets funds,
	vehicles and accounts are in companies or other funds that we do not control.




	        We
	have also recently made minority investments with our principal assets, for example our interest in Nephila and may in the future acquire interests in other investment managers and
	businesses. To the extent these businesses fail to comply with applicable regulations or laws or otherwise suffer reputational damage, our reputation may suffer.

	We make investments in companies that are based outside of the United States, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies
	that are based in the United States.






	        Many of our funds, vehicles and accounts invest or have the flexibility to invest a significant portion of their assets in the equity,
	debt, loans or other securities of issuers that are based outside of the United States. A substantial amount of these investments consist of private equity investments made by our private equity
	funds. For example, as of December 31, 2013, approximately 51% of the unrealized value of the investments of those funds and accounts was attributable to foreign investments. Investing in
	companies that are based in countries outside of the United States and, in particular, in emerging markets such as China, India, Turkey, countries in south and southeast Asia, Latin America and
	Africa, involves risks and considerations that are not typically associated with investments in companies established in the United States. These risks may include the
	following:






	




	the possibility of exchange control regulations, restrictions on repatriation of profit on investments or of capital
	invested, political and social instability, nationalization or expropriation of assets;








	




	the imposition of non-U.S. taxes;








	




	differences in the legal and regulatory environment, for example the recognition of information barriers, or enhanced
	legal and regulatory compliance;








	




	greater levels of corruption and potential exposure to the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers
	of payments to foreign governments, their officials and other third parties;








	




	violations of sanctions regimes;








	




	limitations on borrowings to be used to fund acquisitions or dividends;








	




	limitations on permissible counterparties in our transactions or consolidation rules that effectively restrict the types
	of businesses in which we may invest;








	




	political risks generally, including political hostility to investments by foreign or private equity investors;








	




	less liquid markets;








	




	reliance on a more limited number of commodity inputs, service providers and/or distribution mechanisms;








	




	adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates and costs associated with conversion of investment principal and income
	from one currency into another;








	




	higher rates of inflation;








	




	less available current information about an issuer;








	




	higher transaction costs;

	less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers;








	




	less developed bankruptcy and other laws;








	




	greater application of concepts like equitable subordination, which may, in bankruptcy or insolvency, result in the
	subordination of debt or other senior interests held by our investment funds, vehicles or accounts in companies in which our investment funds, vehicles or accounts also hold equity interests;








	




	difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations;

	




	greater price volatility.






	        As
	a result of the complexity of and lack of clear laws, precedent or authority with respect to the application of various income tax laws to our structures, the application of rules
	governing how transactions and structures should be reported is also subject to differing interpretations. In particular, certain jurisdictions, including Denmark, France, South Korea, and Japan,
	among others, have either proposed or adopted rules that seek to limit the amount of interest that may be deductible where the lender and the borrower are related parties (or where third party
	borrowings have been guaranteed by a related party) and in the case of Germany, without regard to whether the parties are related, or may seek to interpret existing rules in a more restrictive manner.
	In addition, the tax authorities of certain countries, such as Germany, Belgium, France, South Korea, and Singapore, have sought to disallow tax deductions for transaction and certain other costs at
	the portfolio company level either on the basis that the entity claiming the deduction does not benefit from the costs incurred or on other grounds. There is also significant risk in Germany that tax
	losses and interest carry forwards would lose their value on a change of ownership due to restrictive legislation. These measures will most likely adversely affect portfolio companies in those
	jurisdictions in which our investment funds have investments, and limit the benefits of additional investments in those countries. Our business is also subject to the risk that similar measures might
	be introduced in other countries in which our investment funds currently have investments or plan to invest in the future, or that other legislative or regulatory measures that negatively affect their
	respective portfolio investments might be promulgated in any of the countries in which they invest.




	        In
	addition, certain countries such as Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea, where we have made investments, have sought to tax investment gains derived by nonresident
	investors, including private equity funds, from the disposition of the equity in companies operating in those countries. In some cases this development is the result of new legislation or changes in
	the interpretation of existing legislation and local authority assertions that investors have a local taxable presence or are holding companies for trading purposes rather than for capital purposes,
	or are not otherwise entitled to treaty benefits. With respect to India, a general anti-avoidance rule was introduced that would provide a basis for the tax authorities to subject other sales and
	investments through intermediate holding jurisdictions such as Mauritius to Indian tax. The proposed rule is presently scheduled to become effective for tax years beginning on or after April 1,
	2015.




	        Further,
	the tax authorities in certain countries, such as Australia, Belgium, China, Denmark, Germany, and South Korea have sought to deny the benefits of income tax treaties or EU
	Directives with respect to withholding taxes on interest and dividends and in the case of South Korea, capital gains, of nonresident entities, on the basis that the entity benefiting from such treaty
	or Directive is not the owner of the income, is a mere conduit inserted primarily to access treaty benefits or Directives, or otherwise lacks substance.




	        As
	a result of the complexity of our structures, foreign jurisdictions may seek to tax a material portion of the fee income associated with our management advisory activity. Due to the
	complexity, sophistication, and global nature of our investment decision making function, foreign jurisdictions may assert that a material amount of fee income was associated with a taxable presence
	in their jurisdiction and assert that such income is subject to local tax, potentially reducing our profits associated with such income, although this risk may be mitigated by the availability of
	foreign tax credits.




	        Although
	we expect that most of the capital commitments of our funds, vehicles and accounts will be denominated in U.S. dollars, our investments and capital commitments that are
	denominated in a




	77











	Table of Contents





	foreign
	currency, such as euro, will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency
	values are trade balances, the ability of countries to pay their national debt, levels of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term
	opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that such strategies will be
	effective or even available at all. If we engage in hedging transactions, we may be exposed to additional risks associated with such transactions. See "Risk management activities may
	adversely affect the return on our investments."






	Third party investors in our funds with commitment-based structures may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested by us, which could
	adversely affect a fund's operations and performance.






	        Investors in certain of our funds make capital commitments to those funds that the funds are entitled to call from those investors at
	any time during prescribed periods. We depend on fund investors fulfilling their commitments when we call capital from them in order for such funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their
	obligations (for example, management fees) when due. Any fund investor that did not fund a capital call would generally be subject to several possible penalties, including having a significant amount
	of existing investment forfeited in that fund. However, the impact of the penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an investor has
	invested little or no capital, for instance early in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful. Investors may in the future also negotiate for lesser or reduced
	penalties at the outset of the fund, thereby inhibiting our ability to enforce the funding of a capital call. If our fund investors were to fail to satisfy a significant amount of capital calls for
	any particular fund or funds, the operation and performance of those funds could be materially and adversely affected.






	Our equity investments and many of our debt investments often rank junior to investments made by others, exposing us to greater risk of losing our investment.






	        In many cases, the companies in which our funds invest have, or are permitted to have, outstanding indebtedness or equity securities
	that rank senior to our fund's investment. By their terms, such instruments may provide that their holders are entitled to receive payments of distributions, interest or principal on or before the
	dates on which payments are to be made in respect of our investment. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is
	made, holders of securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of its investment. In addition, debt
	investments made by our investment funds, vehicles or accounts in our portfolio companies may be equitably subordinated to the debt investments made by third parties in our portfolio companies. After
	repaying senior security holders, the company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying amounts owed in respect of our investment. To the extent that any assets remain, holders of claims
	that rank equally with our investment would be entitled to share on an equal and ratable basis in distributions that are made out of those assets. Also, during periods of financial distress or
	following an insolvency, the ability of our funds to influence a company's affairs and to take actions to protect their investments may be substantially less than that of the senior creditors.

	Table of Contents







	Risk management activities may adversely affect the return on our investments.






	        When managing exposure to market risks, we employ hedging strategies or certain forms of derivative instruments to limit our exposure
	to changes in the relative values of investments that may result from market developments, including changes in prevailing interest rates and currency exchange rates. The scope of risk management
	activities undertaken by us varies based on the level and volatility of interest rates, prevailing foreign currency exchange rates, the types of investments that are made and other changing market
	conditions. The use of hedging transactions and other derivative instruments to reduce the effects of a decline in the value of a position does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the
	value of the position or prevent losses if the value of the position declines. However, such activities can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting
	the decline in the value of the position. Such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a position increases. Moreover, it may not be possible to limit the exposure to a
	market development that is so generally anticipated that a hedging or other derivative transaction cannot be entered into at an acceptable price.




	        The
	success of any hedging or other derivative transactions that we enter into generally will depend on our ability to correctly predict market changes. As a result, while we may enter
	into such transactions in order to reduce our exposure to market risks, unanticipated market changes may result in poorer overall investment performance than if the hedging or other derivative
	transaction had not been
	executed. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in connection with hedging activities and price movements in a position being hedged may vary.
	Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek or be successful in establishing a perfect correlation between the instruments used in hedging or other derivative transactions and the positions
	being hedged. An imperfect correlation could prevent us from achieving the intended result and could give rise to a loss. In addition, it may not be possible to fully or perfectly limit our exposure
	against all changes in the value of its investments, because the value of investments is likely to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which will be beyond our control or ability to
	hedge.




	        The
	CFTC has proposed or adopted regulations governing swaps and security- based swaps, which may limit our trading activities and our ability to implement effective hedging strategies
	or increase the costs of compliance. See "Risks Related to Our BusinessExtensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities
	and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could result in additional burdens on our business."






	Certain of our funds may make a limited number of investments, or investments that are concentrated in certain geographic regions or asset types, which could negatively
	affect their performance to the extent those concentrated investments perform poorly.






	        The governing agreements of our funds contain only limited investment restrictions and only limited requirements as to diversification
	of fund investments, either by geographic region or asset type. Our private equity funds generally permit up to 20% of the fund to be invested in a single company. During periods of difficult market
	conditions or slowdowns in these sectors or geographic regions, decreased revenues, difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs may be exacerbated by this concentration of
	investments, which would result in lower investment returns. Because a significant portion of a fund's capital may be invested in a single investment or portfolio company, a loss with respect to such
	investment or portfolio company could have a significant adverse impact on such fund's capital. Accordingly, a lack of diversification on the part of a fund could adversely affect a fund's performance
	and therefore, our financial condition and results of operations.

	Because we hold interests in some of our portfolio companies both through our management of private equity funds as well as through separate investments in those funds and
	direct co-investments, fluctuation in the fair values of these portfolio companies may have a disproportionate impact on the investment income earned by us.






	        We hold interests in some of our portfolio companies through our management of private equity funds in our Private Markets segment, as
	well as through separate investments in those funds and co-investments in certain portfolio companies of such funds, in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment. As of December 31,
	2013, we hold significant aggregate investments in each of Alliance Boots GmbH, HCA Inc. and First Data Corporation, which each represent more than 5% of our Capital Markets and
	Principal Activities segment investment balance. As a result of our disproportionate investment in these companies, or any other portfolio companies for which similar investments are held in the
	future, any fluctuation in the fair values of these portfolio companies may have a disproportionate impact on the investment income earned by us as compared to other portfolio companies.






	Our business activities may give rise to a conflict of interest with our funds.






	        As we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our businesses, we increasingly confront potential conflicts
	of interest relating to investment activities among our various funds and also our own account. For example,






	




	In pursuing the interest of our fund investors, we may take actions that could reduce our AUM or our profits that we could
	otherwise realize in the short term.








	




	We may be required to allocate investment opportunities among investment vehicles that may have overlapping investment
	objectives, including vehicles that may have different fee structures, and among KKR co-investment vehicles (including vehicles in which KKR employees may investment) and third party co-investors.








	




	We may, on behalf of our funds or KKR itself, buy, sell, hold or otherwise deal with securities or other investments that
	may be purchased, sold or held by our other funds or that are otherwise issued by a portfolio company in which our funds invest. Conflicts of interest may arise between a fund, on one hand, and KKR on
	the other or among our funds including but not limited to those relating to the purchase or sale of investments, the structuring of, or exercise of rights with respect to investment transactions and
	the advice we provide to our funds.








	




	We may invest on behalf of our fund or for our own account in a portfolio company of one fund that is a competitor,
	service provider, supplier, customer, or other counterparty with respect to a portfolio company of another fund.








	




	We may structure an investment in a manner that may be attractive to fund investors or to KKR Holdings L.P., from a
	tax perspective but that may require corporate taxation to unitholders.








	




	A decision to acquire material non-public information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a
	particular fund or our own account may result in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action.








	




	Our fiduciary obligations to our fund investors may preclude us from pursuing attractive proprietary investment
	opportunities, in particular as we enter into strategic relationships with broad investment mandates similar to the investments we make with our principal assets.








	




	Conflicts may arise in allocating time, services or resources among the investment activities of our funds, KKR, other
	KKR-affiliated entities and the employees of KKR.

	Our principals have made personal investments in a variety of our investment funds, which may result in conflicts of
	interest among investors of our funds or unitholders regarding investment decisions for these funds.








	




	The general partner's entitlement to receive carried interest from many of our funds may create an incentive for that
	general partner to make riskier and more speculative investments on behalf of a fund than would be the case in the absence of such an arrangement. In addition, for our funds that pay carried interest
	based on accrued rather than realized gains, the amount of carried interest to which the general partner is entitled and the timing of its receipt of carried interest will depend on the valuation by
	the general partner of the fund's investment.








	




	From time to time, one of our funds may seek to effect a purchase or sale of an investment with one or more of our other
	funds in a so-called "cross transaction".








	




	The investors in our investment vehicles are based in a wide variety of jurisdictions and take a wide variety of forms,
	and consequently have diverging interests among themselves from a regulatory, tax or legal perspective or with respect to investment policies and target risk/return profiles.








	




	We or our affiliates, including our capital markets business, may receive fees or other compensation in connection with
	specific transactions or different clients that may give rise to conflicts. The decision to take on an opportunity in one of our businesses may, as a practical matter, also limit the ability of one or
	our other businesses to take advantage of other related opportunities.






	        In
	addition, our funds and accounts also invest in a broad range of asset classes throughout the corporate capital structure. These investments include investments in corporate loans and
	debt securities, preferred equity securities and common equity securities. In certain cases, we may manage separate funds or accounts that invest in different parts of the same company's capital
	structure. For example, our credit funds may invest in different classes of the same company's debt and may make debt investments in a company that is owned by one of our private equity funds. In
	those cases, the interests of our funds and accounts may not always be aligned, which could create actual or potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts. For example, one of
	our private equity funds could have an interest in pursuing an acquisition, divestiture or other transaction that, in its judgment, could enhance the value of the private equity investment, even
	though the proposed transaction would
	subject one of our credit fund's debt investments to additional or increased risks. Finally, our ability to effectively implement a public securities strategy may be limited to the extent that
	contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of our private equity business impose restrictions on our engaging in transactions that we may be interested in otherwise pursuing.




	        We
	may also cause different investment funds to invest in a single portfolio company, for example where the fund that made an initial investment no longer has capital available to
	invest. Conflicts may also arise where we make principal investments for our own account or permit employees to invest alongside our investment vehicles or our balance sheet for their own account. In
	certain cases, we may require that a transaction or investment be approved by fund investors or their advisory committees, be approved by an independent valuation expert, be subject to a fairness
	opinion, be based on arms-length pricing data or be calculated in accordance with a formula provided for in a fund's governing documents prior to the completion of the relevant transaction to address
	potential conflicts of interest. Such instances include principal transactions where we or our affiliates warehouse an investment in a portfolio company for the benefit of one or more of our funds or
	accounts pending the contribution of committed capital by the investors in such funds or accounts, follow-on investments by a fund other than a fund which made an initial investment in a company or
	transactions in which we arrange for one of our funds or accounts to buy a security from, or sell a security to, another one of our funds or accounts.

	        Appropriately
	dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and we could suffer reputational damage or potential liability if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal
	appropriately with conflicts as they arise. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our reputation which could in turn
	materially adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including as a result of an inability to raise additional funds and a reluctance of counterparties to do business with us.






	If KFN were deemed to be an "investment company" subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our
	business.






	        Our business would be adversely affected if KFN, the publicly traded specialty finance company managed by us and with which we have
	signed a merger agreement, was to be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. A person will generally be deemed to be an "investment company" for purposes of the Investment
	Company Act if, absent an available exception or exemption, it (i) is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting
	or trading in securities; or (ii) owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and
	cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We believe KFN is
	not and does not propose to be primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, and we do not believe that KFN has held itself out as such. KFN conducts its
	operations primarily through its majority-owned subsidiaries, each of which is either outside of the definition of an investment company as defined in the Investment Company Act or excepted from such
	definition under the Investment Company Act. KFN monitors its holdings regularly to confirm its continued compliance with the 40% test described in clause (ii) above, and restricts its
	subsidiaries with respect to the assets in which each of them can invest and/or the types of securities each of them may issue in order to ensure conformity with exceptions provided by, and rules and
	regulations promulgated under, the Investment Company Act. If the SEC were to disagree with KFN's treatment of one or more of its subsidiaries as being excepted from the Investment Company Act, with
	its determination that one or more of its other holdings are not investment securities for purposes of the 40% test, or with its determinations as to the nature of its business or the manner in which
	it holds itself out, KFN and/or one or more of its subsidiaries could be required either (i) to change substantially the manner in which it conducts its operations to avoid being subject to the
	Investment Company Act or (ii) to register as an investment company. Either of these would likely have a material adverse effect on KFN, its ability to service its indebtedness and to make
	distributions on its shares, and on the market price of its shares and securities, and could thereby materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	        On
	August 31, 2011 the SEC published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding Rule 3a-7 and a concept release seeking information on Section 3(c)(5)(C),
	two provisions with which KFN's subsidiaries must comply under the 40% test described above. Among the issues for which the SEC has requested comment is whether Rule 3a-7 should be modified so
	that parent companies of subsidiaries that rely on Rule 3a-7 should treat their interests in such subsidiaries as investment securities for purposes of the 40% test. The SEC is also seeking
	information about the nature of entities that invest in mortgages and mortgage-related pools and how the SEC staff's interpretive positions in connection with Section 3(c)(5)(C) affect these
	entities. Any guidance or action from the SEC or its staff, including changes that the SEC may ultimately propose and adopt to the way Rule 3a-7 applies to entities or new or modified
	interpretive positions related to Section 3(c)(5)(C), could further inhibit KFN's ability, or the ability of any of its subsidiaries, to pursue its current or future operating strategies, which
	could have a material adverse effect on KFN and on us.

	Investors in certain of our Public Markets funds may redeem their investments in these funds with minimal notice.






	        Investors in our funds of funds along with those in our long/short equity strategy, long/short credit strategy and similar investment
	vehicles may generally submit redemptions to redeem their investments on a quarterly basis following the expiration of a specified period of time or in certain cases capital may be withdrawn earlier
	subject to a fee, in each case subject to the applicable fund's specific redemption provisions. For certain KKR Prisma funds managed as part of a single
	investor's mandate the length of time to redeem an investment may vary and will depend on the liquidity constraints of each KKR Prisma fund's underlying portfolio. Factors which could result in
	investors leaving our funds include changes in interest rates that make other investments more attractive, changes in investor perception regarding our focus or alignment of interest, unhappiness with
	a fund's performance or investment strategy, changes in our reputation, departures or changes in responsibilities of key investment professionals, performance and liquidity needs of fund investors. In
	a declining market or period of economic disruption or uncertainty, the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our AUM could accelerate. The decrease in revenues that would result from
	significant redemptions from our funds of funds or other similar investment vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, net income and cash flows.




	        A
	portion of assets invested in our fund of hedge funds strategy are managed through separately managed accounts or entities structured for investment by one investor or related
	investors whereby we earn management and incentive fees, and we intend to continue to seek additional separately managed account or single entity mandates. The investment management agreements we
	enter into in connection with managing separately managed accounts or entities on behalf of certain clients may be terminated by such clients on as little as 30 days' prior written notice, or
	less in certain prescribed circumstances. In addition, the boards of directors of the certain funds we manage could terminate our advisory engagement of those companies, on as little as
	30 days' prior written notice. Similarly, we provide subadvisory services to other investment advisors and managers. Such investment advisors and managers could terminate our subadvisory
	agreements on as little as 30 days' prior written notice. In the case of any such terminations, the management and incentive fees we earn in connection with managing such account or company
	would immediately cease, which could result in a significant adverse impact on our revenues.




	        A
	fund of funds is subject to risks related to the limited rights it has to withdraw, transfer or otherwise liquidate its investments from the underlying hedge funds or other funds in
	which it invests. Hedge funds, including those in which our fund of funds are invested and the hedge funds we offer to our fund investors, may make investments or hold trading positions in markets
	that are volatile and which may become illiquid. Timely divestiture or sale of trading positions can be impaired by decreased trading volume, increased price volatility, concentrated trading
	positions, limitations on the ability to transfer positions in highly specialized or structured transactions to which they may be a party, and changes in industry and government regulations. It may be
	impossible or costly for hedge funds to liquidate positions rapidly in order to meet margin calls, withdrawal requests or otherwise, particularly if there are other market participants seeking to
	dispose of similar assets at the same time or the relevant market is otherwise moving against a position or in the event of trading halts or daily price movement limits on the market or otherwise.




	        Moreover,
	these risks may be exacerbated for funds of funds such as those we manage. For example, if one of our funds of funds were to invest a significant portion of its assets in two
	or more hedge funds that each had illiquid positions in the same issuer, the illiquidity risk for our funds of hedge funds would be compounded. In 2008 many hedge funds experienced significant
	declines in value. In many cases, these declines in value were both provoked and exacerbated by margin calls and forced selling of assets, often at distressed prices. Moreover, certain funds of funds
	were invested in hedge funds that halted redemptions in the face of illiquidity and other issues, which precluded those




	83











	Table of Contents





	funds
	of funds from receiving their capital back on request. There can be no guarantee that such a situation would not recur, particularly in times of market distress.




	        Terms
	of the governing documents in may also limit a fund of funds' ability to withdraw, transfer or otherwise liquidate their investments in underlying portfolio funds. Under the terms
	of the governing documents of the relevant portfolio funds or other investments, the ability of a fund of funds or account to redeem any amount invested therein may be subject to certain restrictions
	and conditions, including restrictions on the redemption of capital for an initial period, restrictions on the amount of redemptions and the frequency with which redemptions can be made, and
	investment minimums that must be maintained. Additionally, portfolio funds typically reserve the right to reduce ("gate") or suspend redemptions, to set aside ("side pocket") capital that cannot be
	redeemed for so long as an event or circumstance has not occurred or ceased to exist, respectively, and to satisfy redemptions by making distributions in-kind, under certain circumstances. The ability
	of our funds of funds or accounts to redeem portfolio fund interests may be adversely affected to varying degrees by such restrictions depending on, among other things, the length of any restricted
	periods imposed by the portfolio fund, the amount and timing of a requested redemption in relation to the time remaining of any restricted periods imposed by portfolio funds, the aggregate amount of
	redemption requests, the next regularly scheduled redemption dates of such portfolio funds, the imposition of "gates" or suspensions, the use of "side pockets", the decision by a portfolio fund to
	satisfy redemptions in-kind, and the satisfaction of other conditions.




	        In
	addition, certain funds in our Public Markets business are registered under the Investment Company Act as management investment companies. These funds and KKR Asset
	Management LLC, which serves as their investment adviser (or, in the case of the business development company, as its sub-adviser), are subject to the Investment Company Act and the rules
	thereunder. One of these funds is a New York Stock Exchange-listed closed-end fund. In addition, the management fees we are paid for managing the investment company will generally be subject to
	contractual rights the company's board of directors (or, in the case of the business development company we manage, the investment adviser) has to terminate our management of an account on as short as
	60 days' prior notice. Termination of these agreements would reduce the fees we earn from the relevant funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.






	Investments by our fund of funds, long/short equity strategy, long/short credit strategy and any other hedge funds and similar investment vehicles are subject to numerous
	additional risks.






	        Investments by one or more hedge funds and investment vehicles with similar characteristics that we currently advise or may organize in
	the future are subject to numerous additional risks, including the following:






	




	Our long/short equity and long/short credit strategies are newly established without any operating history, and we do not
	have any significant track record as a hedge fund manager.








	




	Generally, there are few limitations on the execution of investment strategies of a hedge fund or fund of funds, which are
	subject to the sole discretion of the management company or the general partner of such funds.








	




	Hedge funds may engage in short selling, which is subject to theoretically unlimited loss, in that the price of the
	underlying security could theoretically increase without limit, thus increasing the cost of buying those securities to cover the short position. There can be no assurance that the security necessary
	to cover a short position will be available for purchase. Purchasing securities to close out the short position can itself cause the price of the securities to rise further, thereby exacerbating the
	loss.






	84











	Table of Contents







	




	Hedge funds and investment vehicles with similar characteristics are exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not
	settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus
	causing the fund to suffer a loss. Counterparty risk is accentuated for contracts with longer maturities where events may intervene to prevent settlement, or where the fund has concentrated its
	transactions with a single or small group of counterparties. Generally, hedge funds and investment vehicles with similar characteristics are not restricted from dealing with any particular
	counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty. Moreover, the fund's internal consideration of the creditworthiness of their counterparties may prove
	insufficient. The absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses.








	




	Credit risk may arise through a default by one of several large institutions that are dependent on one another to meet
	their liquidity or operational needs, so that a default by one institution causes a series of defaults by the other institutions. This systemic risk may adversely affect the financial intermediaries
	(such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges) with which the hedge funds and investment vehicles with similar characteristics interact on a daily basis.








	




	The efficacy of investment and trading strategies depend largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall
	market position in a combination of financial instruments. A hedge fund's trading orders may not be executed in a timely and efficient manner due to various circumstances, including systems failures
	or human error. In such event, the funds might only be able to acquire some but not all of the components of the position, or if the overall position were to need adjustment, the funds might not be
	able to make such adjustment. As a result, the funds would not be able to achieve the market position selected by the management company or general partner of such funds, and might incur a loss in
	liquidating their position.








	




	Hedge funds and funds of funds are subject to risks due to potential illiquidity of assets. Hedge funds and funds of
	funds, directly or indirectly, may make investments in restricted or illiquid investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and which may become illiquid. Timely divestiture or
	sale of trading positions can be impaired by registration requirements, decreased trading volume, increased price volatility, concentrated trading positions, limitations on the ability to transfer
	positions in highly specialized or structured transactions to which they may be a party, and changes in industry and government regulations. It may be impossible or costly for hedge funds or funds of
	funds to liquidate positions rapidly in order to meet margin calls, redemption requests or otherwise, particularly if there are other market participants seeking to dispose of similar assets at the
	same time or the relevant market is otherwise moving against a position or in the event of trading halts or daily price movement limits on the market or otherwise. In addition in a declining market or
	in the event fund investors otherwise demand greater liquidity, the pace of redemptions could accelerate requiring hedge funds or funds of funds to sell assets on unfavorable terms.








	




	Hedge fund investments are also subject to risks relating to investments in commodities, futures, options and other
	derivatives, the prices of which are highly volatile and may be subject to the theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain circumstances, including if the fund writes a call option. Price
	movements of commodities, futures and options contracts and payments pursuant to swap agreements are influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changing supply and demand relationships, trade,
	fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments and national and international political and economic events and policies. The value of futures, options and swap agreements
	also depends upon the price of the commodities underlying them. In addition, hedge funds' assets are subject to the risk of the failure of any of the exchanges on which their positions trade or of
	their clearinghouses or counterparties. Most






	85











	Table of Contents







	U.S.
	commodities exchanges limit fluctuations in certain commodity interest prices during a single day by imposing "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits," the existence of which may reduce
	liquidity or effectively curtail trading in particular markets. Our fund of hedge fund business may also be subject to and may subject our firm to extensive regulations, including those of the
	Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the regulations described under "Risks Related to Our BusinessExtensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and
	creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus or legislative or regulatory changes could result in additional burdens on our business".







	Risks Related to Our Common Units







	As a limited partnership, we qualify for some exemptions from the corporate governance and other requirements of the NYSE.






	        We are a limited partnership and, as a result, qualify for exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements of the
	rules of the NYSE. Pursuant to these exceptions, limited partnerships may elect, and we have elected, not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, including the
	requirements: (i) that the listed company have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; (ii) that the listed company have a
	compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (iii) that the compensation committee be required to consider certain independence factors when engaging
	compensation consultants, legal counsel and other committee advisers. In addition, as a limited partnership, we are not required to obtain unitholder approval for (a) the issuance of common
	units to certain related parties where the number of common units exceeds one percent of the outstanding common units or voting power, (b) the issuance of common units that equals or exceeds
	20% of the outstanding common units or voting power, or (c) a change of control transaction, and we are not required to hold annual unitholder meetings. Accordingly, you do not have the same
	protections afforded to equity holders of entities that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.






	Our founders are able to determine the outcome of any matter that may be submitted for a vote of our limited partners.






	        As of February 18, 2014, KKR Holdings owns 404,369,018 KKR Group Partnership Units, and our senior principals generally have
	sufficient voting power to determine the outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of the holders of our common units, including a merger or consolidation of our business, a sale
	of all or substantially all of our assets and amendments to our partnership agreement that may be material to holders of our common units. In addition, our limited partnership agreement contains
	provisions that enable us to take actions that would materially and adversely affect all holders of our common units or a particular class of holders of common units upon the majority vote of all
	outstanding voting units, and since more than a majority of our voting units are controlled by KKR Holdings, KKR Holdings has the ability to take actions that could materially and adversely affect the
	holders of our common units either as a whole or as a particular class.




	86





















	Table of Contents





	        The voting rights of holders of our common units are further restricted by provisions in our limited partnership agreement stating that any of our common units
	held by a person that beneficially owns 20% or more of any class of our common units then outstanding (other than our Managing Partner or its affiliates, or a direct or subsequently approved
	transferee of our Managing Partner or its affiliates) cannot be voted on any matter. Our limited partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of the holders of our common units
	to call meetings, to acquire information about our operations, and to influence the manner or direction of our management. Our limited partnership agreement does not restrict our Managing Partner's
	ability to take actions that may result in our partnership being treated as an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable state) income tax purposes. Furthermore, holders of our
	common units would not be entitled to dissenters' rights of appraisal under our limited partnership agreement or applicable Delaware law in the event of a merger or consolidation, a sale of
	substantially all of our assets or any other transaction or event.






	Our limited partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) of our Managing Partner and limit remedies available to
	unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of duty. It will be difficult for unitholders to successfully challenge a resolution of a conflict of interest by our Managing Partner
	or by its conflicts committee.






	        Our limited partnership agreement contains provisions that require holders of our common units to waive or consent to conduct by our
	Managing Partner and its affiliates
	that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with fiduciary duties or applicable law. For example, our limited partnership agreement provides that when our Managing Partner is acting in its
	individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our Managing Partner, it may act without any fiduciary obligations to holders of our common units, whatsoever. When our Managing Partner, in its
	capacity as our general partner, or our conflicts committee is permitted to or required to make a decision in its "sole discretion" or "discretion" or that it deems "necessary or appropriate" or
	"necessary or advisable," then our Managing Partner or the conflicts committee will be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests, and will have no
	duty or obligation (fiduciary or otherwise) to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting us or any holder of our common units and will not be subject to any different standards
	imposed by our limited partnership agreement, the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, which is referred to as the Delaware Limited Partnership Act, or under any other law, rule or
	regulation or in equity. These standards reduce the obligations to which our Managing Partner would otherwise be held. See also "We are a Delaware limited partnership, and there are
	provisions in our limited partnership agreement regarding exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors that differ from the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) in a manner that
	may be less protective of the interests of our common unitholders."




	        The
	above modifications of fiduciary duties are expressly permitted by Delaware law. Hence, we and holders of our common units will only have recourse and be able to seek remedies
	against our Managing Partner if our Managing Partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our limited partnership agreement. Unless our Managing Partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our
	limited partnership agreement, we and holders of our common units will not have any recourse against our Managing Partner even if our Managing Partner were to act in a manner that was inconsistent
	with traditional fiduciary duties. Furthermore, even if there has been a breach of the obligations set forth in our limited partnership agreement, our limited partnership agreement provides that our
	Managing Partner and its officers and directors will not be liable to us or holders of our common units, for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and
	non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our Managing Partner or its officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. These
	provisions are detrimental to the holders of our common units because they restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions that without such limitations might constitute breaches of duty
	including fiduciary duties.

	        Whenever
	a potential conflict of interest exists between us and our Managing Partner, our Managing Partner may resolve such conflict of interest. If our Managing Partner determines that
	its resolution of the conflict of interest is on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or is fair and reasonable to us, taking
	into account the totality of the relationships between us and our Managing Partner, then it will be presumed that in making this determination, our Managing Partner acted in good faith. A holder of
	our common units seeking to challenge this resolution of the conflict of interest would bear the burden of overcoming such presumption. This is different from the situation with Delaware corporations,
	where a conflict resolution by an interested party would be presumed to be unfair and the interested party would have the burden of demonstrating that the resolution was fair.




	        Also,
	if our Managing Partner obtains the approval of the conflicts committee of our Managing Partner, the resolution will be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to us and not
	a breach by our Managing Partner of any duties it may owe to us or holders of our common units. This is different from the situation with Delaware corporations, where a conflict resolution by a
	committee consisting solely of independent directors may, in certain circumstances, merely shift the burden of demonstrating unfairness to the plaintiff. If you purchase, receive or otherwise hold a
	common unit, you will be treated as having consented to the provisions set forth in our limited partnership agreement, including provisions regarding conflicts of interest situations that, in the
	absence of such provisions, might be considered a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law. As a result, unitholders will, as a practical matter, not be able to successfully
	challenge an informed decision by the conflicts committee.




	        We
	have also agreed to indemnify our Managing Partner and any of its affiliates and any member, partner, tax matters partner, officer, director, employee agent, fiduciary or trustee of
	our partnership, our Managing Partner or any of our affiliates and certain other specified persons, to the fullest extent permitted by law, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
	joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts incurred by our Managing Partner or these other persons. We have
	agreed to provide this indemnification unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that these persons acted in bad faith or engaged in
	fraud or willful misconduct. We have also agreed to provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings.




	        Our
	Managing Partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units as provided in our limited partnership agreement or assign this right to one of its affiliates or to us. Our
	Managing Partner may use its own discretion, free of fiduciary duty restrictions, in determining whether to exercise this right. As a result, a unitholder may have his common units purchased from him
	at an undesirable time or price. For additional information, see our limited partnership agreement filed as an exhibit to this annual report.




	        Any
	claims, suits, actions or proceedings concerning the matters described above or any other matter arising out of or relating in any way to the limited partnership agreement may only
	be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, any other court in the State of Delaware with subject matter
	jurisdiction.






	The market price and trading volume of our common units may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our common unitholders.






	        The market price of our common units may be highly volatile, could be subject to wide fluctuations and could decline significantly in
	the future. In addition, the trading volume in our common units may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price
	of our common units declines significantly, you may be unable to sell your common units at an attractive

	price,
	if at all. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our common units or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common units
	include:






	




	variations in our quarterly operating results or distributions, which may be substantial;








	




	our policy of taking a long-term perspective on making investment, operational and strategic decisions, which is expected
	to result in significant and unpredictable variations in our quarterly returns;








	




	failure to meet analysts' earnings estimates;








	




	publication of research reports about us or the investment management industry or the failure of securities analysts to
	cover our common units sufficiently;








	




	additions or departures of our principals and other key management personnel;








	




	adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;








	




	changes in market valuations of similar companies;








	




	speculation in the press or investment community;








	




	changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or
	enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;








	




	a lack of liquidity in the trading of our common units;








	




	adverse publicity about the investment management or private equity industry generally or individual scandals,
	specifically; and








	




	general market and economic conditions.








	An investment in our common units is not an investment in any of our funds, and the assets and revenues of our funds are not directly available to us.






	        Our common units are securities of KKR & Co. L.P. only. While our historical consolidated and combined financial
	information includes financial information, including assets and revenues, of certain funds on a consolidated basis, and our future financial information will continue to consolidate certain of these
	funds, such assets and revenues are available to the fund and not to us except to a limited extent through management fees, carried interest or other incentive income, distributions and other proceeds
	arising from agreements with funds, as discussed in more detail in this report.






	Our common unit price may decline due to the large number of common units eligible for future sale, for exchange, and issuable pursuant to our equity incentive plan and
	acquisitions.






	        The market price of our common units could decline as a result of sales of a large number of common units in the market or the
	perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell common units in the future at a time and at a price
	that we deem appropriate. As of February 18, 2014, we have 288,143,327 common units outstanding, which amount excludes common units beneficially owned by KKR Holdings in the form of KKR Group
	Partnership Units discussed below and common units available for future issuance under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, which we refer to as our Equity Incentive
	Plan.




	        As
	of February 18, 2014, KKR Holdings owns 404,369,018 KKR Group Partnership Units that may be exchanged, on a quarterly basis, for our common units on a one-for-one basis,
	subject to customary




	89











	Table of Contents





	conversion
	rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. Except for interests held by our founders and certain interests held by other principals that were vested upon grant,
	interests in KKR Holdings that are held by our principals are subject to time based vesting or performance based vesting and, following such vesting, additional restrictions in certain cases on
	exchanges for a period of one or two years. During 2013, 28,952,216 previously unvested units in KKR Holdings vested. The market price of our common units could decline as a result of the exchange or
	the perception that an exchange may occur of a large number of KKR Group Partnership Units for our common units. These exchanges, or the possibility that these exchanges may occur, also might make it
	more difficult for holders of our common units to sell our common units in the future at a time and at a price that they deem appropriate.




	        In
	addition, we will continue to issue additional common units pursuant to our Equity Incentive Plan. The total number of common units which may be issued under our Equity Incentive Plan
	is equivalent to 15% of the number of fully exchanged and diluted common units outstanding as of the beginning of the year. The amount may be increased each year to the extent that we issue additional
	equity. In addition, our limited partnership agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to
	partnership securities for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our Managing Partner in its sole discretion without the approval of our unitholders, including awards
	representing our common units under the Equity Incentive Plan. See "Executive CompensationKKR & Co. L.P. Equity Incentive Plan". In accordance with the Delaware
	Limited Partnership Act and the provisions of our partnership agreement, we may also issue additional partner interests that have designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are
	different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to our common units. Similarly, the partnership agreements of
	the KKR Group Partnerships authorize the general partners of the KKR Group Partnerships to issue an unlimited number of additional securities of the KKR Group Partnerships with such designations,
	preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to the KKR Group Partnerships Units, and which may be exchangeable for KKR Group Partnership
	Units. In addition, we have and may continue to issue and sell common units of KKR & Co. L.P. to generate cash proceeds to pay withholding taxes, social benefit payments or
	similar payments payable by us in respect of awards granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan or the amount of cash delivered in respect of awards granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan
	that are settled in cash instead of common units.




	        We
	have used and in the future may continue to use common units as consideration in acquisitions and strategic investments. In connection with the proposed merger with KFN and the
	acquisition of Avoca, we expect to exchange or issue a significant number of common units. In addition, in connection with the KKR Prisma and Nephila transactions, we may make certain contingent
	payments in the form of common units. If our valuations of these transactions are not accurate or if the value of these acquisitions and investments is not realized, our distributions per common unit
	and the value of our common units may decline. As of February 18, 2014, (i) in connection with KKR's pending merger with KFN, which is subject to closing, KKR would issue approximately
	104.5 million common units of KKR & Co. L.P. if such merger were to be completed, (ii) in connection with KKR's acquisition of Avoca, KKR is obligated to issue up to
	5.0 million common units (a portion of which is issuable upon the election of the holders of certain convertible securities issued upon consummation of such acquisition, and a portion of which
	is subject to three-year, ratable annual vesting and a substantially concurrent three-year restriction on transfer, subject to accelerated vesting and forfeiture), (iii) in connection with
	KKR's acquisitions and investments, KKR may elect to issue common units for a portion of the contingent payments that KKR may become obligated to deliver in the future, and (iv) KKR is
	obligated to issue common units upon the vesting of equity awards issued under KKR's Equity Incentive Plan. In addition, as of February 18, 2014, KKR may issue (i) up to
	1.7 million common units as registered on its registration statement on Form S-3 (no. 333-187894) in respect of withholding taxes and cash-settled equity awards as described
	therein and elsewhere in this report;




	90











	Table of Contents





	(ii) up
	to 1.4 million common units under the Equity Incentive Plan that were not registered on KKR's registration statement on Form S-8 (no. 333-171601), and
	(iii) up to 404.4 million common units pursuant to KKR's exchange agreement with KKR Holdings and the other parties thereto.





	Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure







	Potential conflicts of interest may arise among our Managing Partner, our affiliates and us. Our Managing Partner and our affiliates have limited fiduciary duties to us and
	the holders of KKR Group Partnership Units, which may permit them to favor their own interests to our detriment and that of the holders of KKR Group Partnership Units.






	        Our Managing Partner, which is our general partner, will manage the business and affairs of our business, and will be governed by a
	board of directors that is co-chaired by our founders, who also serve as our Co-Chief Executive Officers. Conflicts of interest may arise among our Managing Partner and its affiliates, on the one
	hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, our Managing Partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over us and our unitholders.
	These conflicts include, among others, the following:






	




	Our Managing Partner indirectly through its holding of controlling entities determines the amount and timing of the KKR
	Group Partnership's investments and dispositions, cash expenditures, including those relating to compensation, indebtedness, issuances of additional partner interests, tax liabilities and amounts of
	reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to holders of KKR Group Partnership Units;








	




	Our Managing Partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us in resolving conflicts of
	interest, which has the effect of limiting its duties, including fiduciary duties, to us. For example, our affiliates that serve as the general partners of our funds or as broker-dealers have
	fiduciary and/or contractual obligations to our fund investors or other third parties. Such obligations may cause such affiliates to regularly take actions with respect to the allocation of
	investments among our investment funds (including funds that have different fee structures), the purchase or sale of investments in our investment funds, the structuring of investment transactions for
	those funds and the advice and services we provide that comply with these fiduciary and contractual obligations but that might adversely affect our near-term results of operations or cash flow. Our
	Managing Partner will have no obligation to intervene in, or to notify us of, such actions by such affiliates;








	




	Because certain of our principals indirectly hold their KKR Group Partnership Units through KKR Holdings L.P. and
	its subsidiaries, which are not subject to corporate income taxation and we hold some of the KKR Group Partnership Units through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries that are taxable as a
	corporation, conflicts may arise between our principals and us relating to the selection and structuring of investments or transactions, declaring distributions and other matters; without limiting the
	foregoing, certain investments made by us or through our funds may be determined to be held through KKR Management Holdings L.P., which would result in less taxation to our principals who are
	limited partners in KKR Holdings as compared to our unitholders;








	




	Our Managing Partner, including its directors and officers, has limited its and their liability and reduced or eliminated
	its and their duties, including fiduciary duties, under our partnership agreement to the fullest extent permitted by law, while also restricting the remedies available to holders of common units for
	actions that, without these limitations, might constitute breaches of duty, including fiduciary duties. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify our Managing Partner, including its directors and
	officers, and our Managing Partner's affiliates to the fullest extent permitted by law, except with respect to conduct involving bad faith, fraud or willful misconduct;






	91











	Table of Contents







	




	Our partnership agreement does not restrict our Managing Partner from paying us or our affiliates for any services
	rendered, or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf, so long as the terms of any such additional contractual arrangements are fair and
	reasonable to us as determined under our partnership agreement. Neither our limited partnership agreement nor any of the other agreements, contracts and arrangements between us on the one hand, and
	our Managing Partner and its affiliates on the other, are or will be the result of arm's-length negotiations. The conflicts committee will be responsible for, among other things, enforcing our rights
	and those of our unitholders under certain agreements against KKR Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries and designees, a general partner or limited partner of KKR Holdings, or a person who holds a
	partnership or equity interest in the foregoing entities;








	




	Our Managing Partner and its affiliates will have no obligation to permit us to use any facilities or assets of our
	Managing Partner and its affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into specifically dealing with such use. There will not be any obligation of our Managing Partner and its affiliates
	to enter into any contracts of this kind.








	




	Our Managing Partner determines how much debt we incur and that decision may adversely affect any credit ratings we
	receive;








	




	Our Managing Partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us;








	




	Other than as set forth in the confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements, which in certain cases may only be
	agreements between our principals and KKR Holdings and which may not be enforceable by us or otherwise waived, modified or amended, affiliates of our Managing Partner and existing and former personnel
	employed by our Managing Partner are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us;








	




	Our Managing Partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to the KKR Group Partnerships by us and our affiliates;
	and








	




	Our Managing Partner or our Managing Partner conflicts committee decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants
	or others to perform services for us.






	        See
	"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence."






	Certain actions by our Managing Partner's board of directors require the approval of the Class A shares of our Managing Partner, all of which are held by our senior
	principals.






	        All of our Managing Partner's outstanding Class A shares are held by our senior principals. Although the affirmative vote of a
	majority of the directors of our Managing Partner is required for any action to be taken by our Managing Partner's board of directors, certain specified actions approved by our Managing Partner's
	board of directors will also require the approval of a majority of the Class A shares of our Managing Partner. These actions consist of the following:






	




	the entry into a debt financing arrangement by us in an amount in excess of 10% of our existing long-term indebtedness
	(other than the entry into certain intercompany debt financing arrangements);








	




	the issuance by our partnership or our subsidiaries of any securities that would (i) represent, after such
	issuance, or upon conversion, exchange or exercise, as the case may be, at least 5% on a fully diluted, as converted, exchanged or exercised basis, of any class of our or their equity securities or
	(ii) have designations, preferences, rights, priorities or powers that are more favorable than those of KKR Group Partnership Units;

	




	the adoption by us of a shareholder rights plan;








	




	the amendment of our limited partnership agreement or the limited partnership agreements of the KKR Group Partnerships;








	




	the exchange or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of any KKR Group Partnership;








	




	the merger, sale or other combination of the partnership or any KKR Group Partnership with or into any other person;








	




	the transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation or grant of a security interest in all or substantially all of the assets of
	the KKR Group Partnerships;








	




	the appointment or removal of a Chief Executive Officer or a Co-Chief Executive Officer of our Managing Partner or our
	partnership;








	




	the termination of the employment of any of our officers or the officers of any of our subsidiaries or the termination of
	the association of a partner with any of our subsidiaries, in each case, without cause;








	




	the liquidation or dissolution of the partnership, our Managing Partner or any KKR Group Partnership; and








	




	the withdrawal, removal or substitution of our Managing Partner as our general partner or any person as the general
	partner of a KKR Group Partnership, or the transfer of beneficial ownership of all or any part of a general partner interest in our partnership or a KKR Group Partnership to any person other than one
	of its wholly owned subsidiaries.






	In
	addition, holders representing a majority of the Class A shares of our Managing Partner have the authority to unilaterally appoint our Managing Partner's directors and also have the ability
	to appoint the officers of our Managing Partner. Messrs. Kravis and Roberts, as the designated members of our Managing Partner, represent a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding
	Class A shares, when they act together. However, neither of them controls the voting of the Class A shares, when acting alone.






	Our common unitholders do not elect our Managing Partner or vote on our Managing Partner's directors and have limited ability to influence decisions regarding our business.






	        Our common unitholders do not elect our Managing Partner or its board of directors and, unlike the holders of common stock in a
	corporation, have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and therefore limited ability to influence decisions regarding our
	business. Furthermore, if our common unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our Managing Partner, they have no ability to remove our Managing Partner, with or without cause.






	The control of our Managing Partner may be transferred to a third party without our consent.






	        Our Managing Partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or consolidation or in a transfer of all or
	substantially all of its assets without our consent or the consent of our common unitholders. Furthermore, the members of our Managing Partner may sell or transfer all or part of their limited
	liability company interests in our Managing Partner without our approval, subject to certain restrictions. A new general partner may not be willing or able to form new funds and could form funds that
	have investment objectives and governing terms that differ materially from those of our current funds. A new owner could also have a different investment philosophy, employ investment professionals
	who are less experienced, be unsuccessful in identifying investment opportunities or have a track record that is not as successful as our track record. If any of the




	93











	Table of Contents





	foregoing
	were to occur, we could experience difficulty in making new investments, and the value of our existing investments, our business, our results of operations and our financial condition could
	materially suffer.






	We intend to pay periodic distributions to the holders of our common units, but our ability to do so may be limited by our holding company structure and contractual
	restrictions.






	        We intend to pay cash distributions on a quarterly basis. We are a holding company and have no material assets other than the KKR Group
	Partnership Units that we hold through wholly-owned subsidiaries and have no independent means of generating income. Accordingly, we intend to cause the KKR Group Partnerships to make distributions on
	the KKR Group Partnership Units, including KKR Group Partnership Units that we directly or indirectly hold, in order to provide us with sufficient amounts to fund distributions we may declare.
	If the KKR Group Partnerships make such distributions, other holders of KKR Group Partnership Units, including KKR Holdings, will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on
	their KKR Group Partnership Units.




	        The
	declaration and payment of any future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Managing Partner, which may change our distribution policy at any time. Our Managing Partner
	will take into account general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our business and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results,
	compensation expense, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, debt and contractual restrictions and obligations (including payment obligations pursuant to the tax receivable
	agreement), legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, restrictions or other implications on the payment of distributions by us to the holders of KKR Group Partnership Units or by our subsidiaries to us
	and such other factors as our Managing Partner may deem relevant. Under the Delaware Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to a partner if after the distribution all our liabilities,
	other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership, would exceed the
	fair value of our assets. If we were to make such an impermissible distribution, any limited partner who received a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in
	violation of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act would be liable to us for the amount of the distribution for three years. Furthermore, by paying cash distributions rather than investing that cash in
	our businesses, we risk slowing the pace of our growth, or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations, new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures, should the need arise.




	        Our
	ability to characterize such distributions as capital gains or qualified dividend income may be limited, and you should expect that some or all of such distributions may be regarded
	as ordinary income.






	We will be required to pay our principals for most of the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax
	basis step-up we receive in connection with subsequent exchanges of our common units and related transactions.






	        We and one or more of our intermediate holding companies are required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant
	to our exchange agreement with KKR Holdings. To the extent this occurs, the exchanges are expected to result in an increase in one of our intermediate holding company's share of the tax basis of the
	tangible and intangible assets of KKR Management Holdings L.P., primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business, that would not otherwise have been available. This
	increase in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization and therefore reduce the amount of income tax our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay
	in the future. This increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.




	94











	Table of Contents





	        We
	are party to a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings requiring our intermediate holding company to pay to KKR Holdings or transferees of its KKR Group Partnership Units 85% of
	the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies actually realize as a result of this increase in tax basis, as well as 85% of
	the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies actually realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. A termination of the
	agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events. This payment obligation will be an
	obligation of our intermediate holding companies and not of either KKR Group Partnership. In the event that any of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire KKR
	Group Partnership Units in the future, or if we become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect that each such entity will become subject to a tax receivable agreement
	with substantially similar terms. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including
	the timing of exchanges, the price of our common units at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our taxable income, we expect that as a
	result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships, the payments that we may be required to make to our existing owners will be
	substantial. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon our existing owners' continued ownership of us. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the tax
	receivable agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise. In particular, our
	intermediate holding companies' obligations under the tax receivable agreement would be effectively accelerated in the event of an early termination of the tax receivable agreement by our intermediate
	holding companies or in the event of certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable
	agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity.




	        Payments
	under the tax receivable agreement will be based upon the tax reporting positions that our Managing Partner will determine. We are not aware of any issue that would cause the
	IRS to challenge a tax basis increase. However, neither KKR Holdings nor its transferees will reimburse us for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if such tax basis
	increase, or the tax benefits we claim arising from such increase, is successfully challenged by the IRS. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments to KKR Holdings or its transferees under the
	tax receivable agreement could be in excess of the intermediate holding companies' cash tax savings. The intermediate holding companies' ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and
	the payments to be made under this agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, as discussed above, including the timing and amount of our future income.






	If we were deemed to be an "investment company" subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue
	our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.






	        A person will generally be deemed to be an "investment company" for purposes of the Investment Company Act
	if:






	




	it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing,
	reinvesting or trading in securities; or








	




	absent an applicable exemption, it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the
	value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.






	95











	Table of Contents





	        We
	believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of providing investment management services and not in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We regard
	ourselves as an investment management firm and do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are an
	"orthodox" investment company as defined in Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act and described in the first bullet point above.




	        With
	regard to the provision described in the second bullet point above, we have no material assets other than our equity interests in subsidiaries, which in turn have no material assets
	other than equity interests, directly or indirectly, in the KKR Group Partnerships. Through these interests, we indirectly are the sole general partners of the KKR Group Partnerships and indirectly
	are vested with all management and control over the KKR Group Partnerships. We do not believe our equity interests in our subsidiaries are investment securities, and we believe that the capital
	interests of the general partners of our funds in their respective funds are neither securities nor investment securities. Accordingly, based on our determination, less than 40% of the partnership's
	total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis are comprised of assets that could be considered investment securities. However, our subsidiaries have
	a significant number of investment securities, and we expect to make investments in other investment securities from time to time. We monitor these holdings regularly to confirm our continued
	compliance with the 40% test described in the second bullet point above. The need to comply with this 40% test may cause us to restrict our business and subsidiaries with respect to the assets in
	which we can invest and/or the types of securities we may issue, sell investment securities, including on unfavorable terms, acquire assets or businesses that could change the nature of our business
	or potentially take other actions which may be viewed as adverse by the holders of our common units, in order to ensure conformity with exceptions provided by, and rules and regulations promulgated
	under, the Investment Company Act.




	        The
	Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operation of investment companies. Among other things, the Investment Company
	Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, generally prohibit the issuance of options and impose
	certain governance requirements. We intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If anything were to happen which would
	cause the partnership to be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, requirements imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure,
	ability to transact business with affiliates and ability to compensate key employees, would make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted, impair the agreements and
	arrangements between and among the partnership, the KKR Group Partnerships and KKR Holdings, or any combination thereof, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
	of operations. In addition, we may be required to limit the amount of investments that we make as a principal, potentially divest of our investments or otherwise conduct our business in a manner that
	does not subject us to the registration and other requirements of the Investment Company Act.






	We are a Delaware limited partnership, and there are certain provisions in our limited partnership agreement regarding exculpation and indemnification of our officers and
	directors that differ from the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) in a manner that may be less protective of the interests of our common unitholders.






	        Our limited partnership agreement provides that to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law our directors or officers will not be
	liable to us. However, under the DGCL, a director or officer would be liable to us for (i) breach of duty of loyalty to us or our shareholders, (ii) intentional misconduct or knowing
	violations of the law that are not done in good faith, (iii) improper redemption of shares or declaration of dividend, or (iv) a transaction from which the director derived an improper
	personal




	96











	Table of Contents





	benefit.
	In addition, our limited partnership agreement provides that we indemnify our directors and officers for acts or omissions to the fullest extent provided by law. However, under the DGCL, a
	corporation can only indemnify directors and officers for acts or omissions if the director or officer acted in good faith, in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the
	corporation, and, in criminal action, if the officer or director had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Accordingly, our limited partnership agreement may be less protective of
	the interests of our common unitholders, when compared to the DGCL, insofar as it relates to the exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors. See also "Our limited
	partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) of our limited partner and limit remedies available for unitholders for actions that might
	otherwise constitute a breach of duty. It will be difficult for unitholders to successfully challenge a resolution of a conflict of interest by our Managing Partner or by its conflicts committee."





	Risks Related to U.S. Taxation







	If we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax or state tax purposes, then our distributions to you would be substantially reduced and the value of our
	common units could be adversely affected.






	        The value of your investment in us depends in part on our being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
	which requires that 90% or more of our gross income for every taxable year consist of qualifying income, as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code, and that our partnership not be
	registered under the Investment Company Act. Qualifying income generally includes dividends, interest, capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stocks and securities, gain from the sale or
	other disposition of real property, real property rents, income and gains from energy and oil and gas investments and certain other forms of investment income. We intend to structure our investments
	so as to satisfy these requirements, including by generally holding investments that generate non-qualifying income through one or more subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes. Nonetheless, we may not meet these requirements, may not correctly identify investments that should be owned through corporate subsidiaries, or current law may change so as to
	cause, in any of these events, us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to U.S. federal income tax. We have not requested, and do not plan to
	request, a ruling from the IRS, on this or any other matter affecting us.




	        If
	we were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would pay U.S. federal, state and local income tax on our taxable income at the applicable tax rates.
	Distributions to you would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would otherwise flow through to you. Because a tax would be imposed
	upon us as a corporation, our distributions to you would be substantially reduced which could cause a reduction in the value of our common units.




	        Current
	law may change, causing us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal or state income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting us to entity level taxation. See
	"Risks Related to Our BusinessThe U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would have (i) in some cases after a ten-year period, precluded us from qualifying as a
	partnership or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and (ii) taxed certain income and gains at increased rates. If any similar legislation were to be
	enacted and apply to us, the after tax income and gain related to our business, as well as the market price of our units, could be reduced." Several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships
	to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. If any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity, our distributions to you would be
	reduced.

	Table of Contents







	You will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on your share of our taxable income, regardless of whether you receive any cash distributions, and may recognize income in
	excess of cash distributions.






	        As long as 90% of our gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income as defined in Section 7704 of the
	Internal Revenue Code and we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act on a continuing basis, and assuming there is no change in law, we will be treated,
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a partnership and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. As a result, a U.S. unitholder will be subject to U.S.
	federal, state, local and possibly, in some cases, foreign income taxation on its allocable share of our items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit (including its allocable share of those items
	of any entity in which we invest that is treated as a partnership or is otherwise subject to tax on a flow through basis) for each of our taxable years ending with or within the unitholder's taxable
	year, regardless of whether or when such unitholder receives cash distributions. See "Risks Related to Our BusinessThe U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would
	have (i) in some cases after a ten-year period, precluded us from qualifying as a partnership or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and
	(ii) taxed certain income and gains at increased rates. If any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us, the after tax income and gain related to our business, as well as the
	market price of our units, could be reduced."




	        You
	may not receive cash distributions equal to your allocable share of our net taxable income or even the tax liability that results from that income. In addition, certain of our
	holdings, including holdings, if any, in a controlled foreign corporation, or a CFC, a passive foreign investment company, or a PFIC, or entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes, may produce taxable income prior to the receipt of cash relating to such income, and holders of our common units that are U.S. taxpayers may be required to take such income into account in
	determining their taxable income. In the event of an inadvertent termination of the partnership status for which the IRS has granted limited relief, each holder of our common units may be obligated to
	make such adjustments as the IRS may require to maintain our status as a partnership. Such adjustments may require the holders of our common units to recognize additional amounts in income during the
	years in which they hold such units. In addition, because of our methods of allocating income and gain among holders of our common units, you may be taxed on amounts that accrued economically before
	you became a unitholder. For example, phantom income from the portfolio or due to operational activities may arise during a month and be allocated to you, creating taxable liability that KKR would not
	consider in a quarterly distribution because KKR typically considers tax distributions on an annual basis. Consequently, you may recognize taxable income without receiving any cash.




	        Although
	we expect that distributions we make should be sufficient to cover a holder's tax liability in any given year that is attributable to its investment in us, no assurances can be
	made that this will be the case. We will be under no obligation to make any such distribution and, in certain circumstances, may not be able to make any distributions or will only be able to make
	distributions in amounts less than a holder's tax liability attributable to its investment in us. In addition, we anticipate making quarterly distributions but allocate taxable income on a monthly
	basis. As a result, if you dispose of your common units, you may be allocated taxable income during the time you held your common units without receiving any cash distributions corresponding to that
	period. Accordingly, each holder should ensure that it has sufficient cash flow from other sources to pay all tax liabilities.






	Our interests in certain of our businesses will be held through intermediate holding companies, which will be treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
	such corporations will be liable for significant taxes and may create other adverse tax consequences, which could potentially adversely affect the value of our common units.






	        In light of the publicly traded partnership rules under U.S. federal income tax laws and other requirements, we will hold our interest
	in certain of our businesses through intermediate holding




	98











	Table of Contents





	companies,
	which will be treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These intermediate holding companies will be liable for U.S. federal income taxes at regular rates on all of
	their taxable income as well as applicable state, local and other taxes. These taxes would reduce the amount of distributions available to be made on our common units. In addition, these taxes could
	be increased if the IRS were to successfully reallocate deductions or income of the related entities conducting our business.






	Changes in U.S. tax law could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from certain foreign investors.






	        Under the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, U.S. withholding agents and all entities in a broadly defined class of
	foreign financial institutions, or FFIs, are required to comply with a complicated and expansive reporting regime or, beginning after June 30, 2014, be subject to a 30% United States
	withholding tax on certain U.S. payments (and beginning in 2017, a 30% withholding tax on gross proceeds from the sale of U.S. stocks and securities) and non-U.S. entities which are not FFIs are
	required to either certify they have no substantial U.S. beneficial ownership or to report certain information with respect to their substantial U.S. beneficial
	ownership or, beginning after June 30, 2014, be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax on certain U.S. payments (and beginning in 2017, a 30% withholding tax on gross proceeds from the sale of
	U.S. stocks and securities). The reporting obligations imposed under FATCA require FFIs to enter into agreements with the IRS to obtain and disclose information about certain fund investors to the
	IRS. In addition, the administrative and economic costs of compliance with FATCA may discourage some foreign investors from investing in U.S. funds, which could adversely affect our ability to raise
	funds from these investors.






	Complying with certain tax-related requirements may cause us to invest through foreign or domestic corporations subject to corporate income tax or enter into acquisitions,
	borrowings, financings or arrangements we may not have otherwise entered into.






	        In order for us to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not as an association or publicly traded
	partnership taxable as a corporation, we must meet the qualifying income exception discussed above on a continuing basis and we must not be required to register as an investment company under the
	Investment Company Act. In order to effect such treatment, we or our subsidiaries may be required to invest through foreign or domestic corporations subject to corporate income tax, or enter into
	acquisitions, borrowings, financings or other transactions we may not have otherwise entered into.






	We may hold or acquire certain investments through an entity classified as a PFIC or CFC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.






	        Certain of our investments may be in foreign corporations or may be acquired through a foreign subsidiary that would be classified as a
	corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such an entity may be PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may hold certain investments in foreign corporations that are treated
	as CFCs. Unitholders may experience adverse U.S. tax consequences as a result of holding an indirect interest in a PFIC or CFC. These investments may produce taxable income prior to the receipt of
	cash relating to such income, and unitholders that are U.S. taxpayers will be required to take such income into account in determining their gross income subject to tax. In addition, all or a portion
	of gain on the sale of a CFC may be taxable at ordinary income rates. Further, with respect to gain on the sale of and excess distributions from a PFIC for which an election for current inclusions is
	not made, such income would be taxable at ordinary income rates and be subject to an additional tax charge equivalent to an interest charge on the deferral of income inclusions from that PFIC.




	99











	Table of Contents







	Tax gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.






	        If you sell your common units, you will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your adjusted
	tax basis allocated to those common units. Prior distributions to you in excess of the total net taxable income allocated to you will have decreased the tax basis in your common units. Therefore, such
	excess distributions will increase your taxable gain, or decrease your taxable loss, when the common units are sold and may result in a taxable gain even if the sale price is less than the original
	cost. A portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be ordinary income to you.






	Unitholders may be allocated taxable gain on the disposition of certain assets, even if they did not share in the economic appreciation inherent in such assets.






	        We and our intermediate holding companies will be allocated taxable gains and losses recognized by the KKR Group Partnerships based
	upon our percentage ownership in each KKR Group Partnership. Our share of such taxable gains and losses generally will be allocated pro rata to our unitholders. In some circumstances, under the U.S.
	federal income tax rules affecting partners and partnerships, the taxable gain or loss allocated to a unitholder may not correspond to that unitholder's share of the economic appreciation or
	depreciation in the particular asset. This is primarily an issue of the timing of the payment of tax, rather than a net increase in tax liability, because the gain or loss allocation would generally
	be expected to be offset as a unitholder sold units.






	Non-U.S. persons face unique U.S. tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.






	        We expect that we will be engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including by reason of investments
	in U.S. real property holding corporations, real estate assets and energy assets, in which case some portion of our income would be treated as effectively connected income with respect to non-U.S.
	holders, or ECI. To the extent our income is treated as ECI, non-U.S. unitholders generally would be subject to withholding tax on their allocable share of such income, would be required to
	file a U.S. federal income tax return for such year reporting their allocable share of income effectively connected with such trade or business and any other income treated as ECI, and would be
	subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular U.S. tax rates on any such income (state and local income taxes and filings may also apply in that event). Non-U.S. unitholders that are corporations may
	also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax (potentially reduced under an applicable treaty) on their actual or deemed distributions of such income. In addition, distributions to non-U.S. unitholders
	that are attributable to profits on the sale of a U.S. real property interest may also be subject to 30% withholding tax. Also, non-U.S. unitholders may be subject to 30% withholding on allocations of
	our income that are U.S. source fixed or determinable annual or periodic
	income under the Internal Revenue Code, unless an exemption from or a reduced rate of such withholding applies (under an applicable treaty of the Internal Revenue Code) and certain tax status
	information is provided.






	Tax-exempt entities face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.






	        Generally, a tax-exempt partner of a partnership would be treated as earning unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, if the
	partnership regularly engages in a trade or business that is unrelated to the exempt function of the tax-exempt partner, if the partnership derives income from debt-financed property or if the partner
	interest itself is debt-financed. As a result of our ownership of real estate assets and energy assets and incurrence of acquisition indebtedness we will derive income that constitutes UBTI.
	Consequently, a holder of common units that is a tax-exempt entity (including an individual retirement account, or IRA, or a 401(k) plan participant) will likely be subject to unrelated




	100











	Table of Contents





	business
	income tax to the extent that its allocable share of our income consists of UBTI and thus may be subject to U.S. federal income taxes and U.S. federal income tax reporting with respect to
	such income. In addition, a tax-exempt investor may be subject to unrelated business income tax on a sale of their common units.






	We cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, and we will therefore adopt certain income tax accounting conventions that may not conform with all aspects of
	applicable tax requirements. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our common units.






	        Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, we have adopted depreciation, amortization and other tax
	accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing Treasury regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available
	to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result
	in audits of and adjustments to our unitholders' tax returns.




	        In
	addition, our taxable income and losses are determined and apportioned among unitholders using conventions we regard as consistent with applicable law. As a result, if you transfer
	your common units, you may be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction realized by us after the date of transfer. Similarly, a transferee may be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction realized
	by us prior to the date of the transferee's acquisition of our common units. A transferee may also bear the cost of withholding tax imposed with respect to income allocated to a transferor through a
	reduction in the cash distributed to the transferee.






	The sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profit interests will result in the termination of our partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.






	        We will be considered to have been terminated for U.S. federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the
	total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. A termination of our partnership would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders.






	Holders of our common units may be subject to state, local and foreign taxes and return filing requirements as a result of owning such units.






	        In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, holders of our common units may be subject to other taxes, including state, local and foreign
	taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future, even if the
	holders of our common units do not reside in any of those jurisdictions. Holders of our common units may be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in
	some or all of these jurisdictions in the U.S. and abroad. Further, holders of our common units may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. It is the responsibility of
	each unitholder to file all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax returns that may be required of such unitholder. In addition our investments in real assets may expose unitholders to additional
	adverse tax consequences. See "Our investments in real assets such as real estate and energy may expose us to increased risks and liabilities and may expose our unitholders to adverse tax
	consequences."

	Table of Contents







	Certain U.S. holders of common units are subject to additional tax on "net investment income".






	        U.S. holders that are individuals, estates or trusts are subject to a Medicare tax of 3.8% on "net investment income" (or undistributed
	"net investment income," in the case of estates and trusts) for each taxable year, with such tax applying to the lesser of such income or the excess of such person's adjusted gross income (with
	certain adjustments) over a specified amount. Net investment income includes net income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties and rents and net gain attributable to the disposition of
	investment property. It is anticipated that net income and gain attributable to an investment in our common units will be included in a U.S. holder's "net investment income" subject to this Medicare
	tax.






	We may not be able to furnish to each unitholder specific tax information within 90 days after the close of each calendar year, which means that holders of common
	units who are U.S. taxpayers should anticipate the need to file annually a request for an extension of the due date of their income tax return.






	        As a publicly traded partnership, our operating results, including distributions of income, dividends, gains, losses or deductions, and
	adjustments to carrying basis, will be reported on Schedule K-1 and distributed to each unitholder annually. It may require longer than 90 days after the end of our fiscal year to obtain
	the requisite information from all lower-tier entities so that Schedule K-1s may be prepared for the unitholders. For this reason, holders of common units who are U.S. taxpayers should
	anticipate the need to file annually with the IRS (and certain states) a request for an extension past April 15 or the otherwise applicable due date of their income tax return for the taxable
	year.

	        We
	have declared a distribution of $0.48 per common unit payable on March 4, 2014 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February 18, 2014.




	        We
	intend to make quarterly cash distributions in amounts that in the aggregate are expected to constitute substantially all of the cash earnings of our investment management business
	and 40% of the net cash income from our realized principal investments, in each case in excess of amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to
	make appropriate investments in our business and our investment funds and to comply with applicable law and any of our debt instruments or other obligations. Subject to the completion of the KFN
	merger, we expect to maintain the same distribution policy except we intend to make quarterly cash distributions of 100% of KFN's realized earnings and 40% of the net cash income from our other
	realized principal investments. For purposes of our distribution policy, distributions are expected to consist of (i) FRE, (ii) carry distributions received from our investment funds
	which have not been allocated as part of our carry pool and (iii) a percentage of net realized principal investment income as described above. This amount
	is expected to be reduced by (i) corporate and applicable local taxes, if any, (ii) non-controlling interests, and (iii) amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate
	for the conduct of our business and other matters as discussed above.

	        Our
	distribution policy reflects our belief that distributing substantially all of the cash earnings of our investment management business will provide transparency for holders of our
	common units and impose on us an investment discipline with respect to the businesses and strategies that we pursue. We believe distributing a meaningful portion of our net realized principal
	investment income allows the holders of our common units to participate in the returns generated on our balance sheet assets, while still allowing us to retain significant capital to invest in our
	business.




	        Because
	we make our investment in our business through a holding company structure and the applicable holding companies do not own any material cash-generating assets other than their
	direct and indirect holdings in KKR Group Partnership Units, distributions are expected to be funded in the following manner:






	




	First, the KKR Group Partnerships will make distributions to holders of KKR Group Partnership Units, including the holding
	companies through which we invest, in proportion to their percentage interests in the KKR Group Partnerships;








	




	Second, the holding companies through which we invest will distribute to us the amount of any distributions that they
	receive from the KKR Group Partnerships, after deducting any applicable taxes, and








	




	Third, we will distribute to holders of our units the amount of any distributions that we receive from our holding
	companies through which we invest.






	        The
	partnership agreements of the KKR Group Partnerships provide for cash distributions, which are referred to as tax distributions, to the partners of such partnerships if we determine
	that the taxable income of the relevant partnership will give rise to taxable income for its partners. We expect that the
	KKR Group Partnerships would make tax distributions only to the extent distributions from such partnerships for the relevant year were otherwise insufficient to cover such tax liabilities, which would
	generally be computed based on an estimate of the net taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a partner multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal
	combined U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in New York, New York (taking into account the non-deductibility of certain expenses and the
	character of our income.) However, in light of our current distribution policy, we expect that the KKR Group Partnerships will not make tax distributions, because our distributions paid under our
	current policy are generally expected to be sufficient to permit U.S. holders of KKR Group Partnership Units to fund their estimated U.S. tax obligations (including any federal, state and local income
	taxes) with respect to their distributive shares of net income or gain, after taking into account any withholding tax imposed on us. There can be no assurance that, for any particular holder, such
	distributions will be sufficient to pay such holder's actual U.S. or non-U.S. tax liability.




	        The
	declaration and payment of any distributions are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of our Managing Partner and the terms of our limited partnership agreement. There
	can be no assurance that distributions will be made as intended or at all or that such distributions will be sufficient to pay any particular KKR & Co. L.P. unitholder's actual
	U.S. or non-U.S. tax liability. In particular, the amount and timing of distributions will depend upon a number of factors, including, among others, our available cash and current and anticipated cash
	needs, including funding of investment commitments and debt service and future debt repayment obligations; general economic and business conditions; our strategic plans and prospects; our results of
	operations and financial condition; our capital requirements; legal, contractual and regulatory restrictions on the payment of distributions by us or our subsidiaries, including restrictions contained
	in our debt agreements, and such other factors as the board of directors of our Managing Partner considers relevant.




	        The
	Managing Partner may change the distribution policy at any time and from time to time. We are not currently restricted by any contract from making distributions to our unitholders,
	although

	certain
	of our subsidiaries are bound by credit agreements that contain certain restricted payment and/or other covenants, which may have the effect of limiting the amount of distributions that we
	receive from our subsidiaries. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquiditySources of Cash". In addition, under
	Section 17-607 of the Delaware Limited Partnership Act, we will not be permitted to make a distribution if, after giving effect to the distribution, our liabilities would exceed the fair value
	of our assets.





	Common Unit Repurchases in the Fourth Quarter of 2013





	        No purchases of our common units were made by us or on our behalf in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2013.
	During the fourth quarter of 2013, no KKR Group Partnership Units were exchanged by KKR Holdings or our principals for our common units.





	Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities





	        A subsidiary of KKR & Co. L.P. agreed to deliver an aggregate of up to 5.0 million common units of
	KKR & Co. L.P. in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and/or Regulation S promulgated thereunder, in partial consideration for the sellers'
	equity interests in Avoca and its subsidiaries. Subsequent to the completed acquisition of Avoca, a portion will be issuable upon the election of the holders of certain convertible securities of one
	of our subsidiaries that was issued upon consummation of the acquisition, and a portion will be issuable subject to three-year, ratable annual vesting and a substantially concurrent three-year
	restriction on transfer, subject to accelerated vesting and forfeiture upon the occurrence of certain customary events. KKR & Co. L.P. also entered into a registration rights
	agreement with the selling shareholders of Avoca.

	Subsequent
	to the KPE Transaction, net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. reflects only those amounts that are allocable to
	KKR & Co. L.P.'s interest in our business. Net income (loss) that is allocable to our principals' interest in our business is reflected in net income (loss) attributable to
	noncontrolling interests.






	(3)




	Total
	KKR & Co. L.P. partners' capital reflects only the portion of equity attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. (41.6%
	interest in the KKR Group Partnerships as of December 31, 2013) and differs from book value reported on a segment basis primarily as a result of the exclusion of the equity impact of KKR
	Management Holdings Corp. and allocations of equity to KKR Holdings. KKR Holdings' 58.4% interest in the KKR Group Partnerships as of December 31, 2013 is reflected as noncontrolling interests
	and is not included in total KKR & Co. L.P. partners' capital.

	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
	of KKR and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. The historical consolidated financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of KKR. In addition,
	this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements"
	and "Risk Factors." Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements.






	Overview





	        Led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, we are a leading global investment firm with $94.3 billion in AUM as of
	December 31, 2013 and a 37-year history of leadership, innovation and investment excellence. When our founders started our firm in 1976, they established the principles that guide our business
	approach today, including a patient and disciplined investment process; the alignment of our interests with those of our fund investors, portfolio companies and other stakeholders; and a focus on
	attracting world class talent.




	        Our
	business offers a broad range of investment management services to our fund investors and provides capital markets services to our firm, our portfolio companies and third parties.
	Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 230 private equity investments in portfolio companies with a total transaction
	value in excess of $485 billion. In recent years, we have grown our firm by expanding our geographical presence and building businesses in new areas, such as credit, special situations, equity
	strategies, hedge fund solutions, capital markets, infrastructure, energy and real estate. Our new efforts build on our core principles and industry expertise, allowing us to leverage the intellectual
	capital and synergies in our businesses, and to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source. Additionally, we have increased our focus on meeting the needs of our existing fund
	investors and in developing relationships with new investors in our funds.




	        We
	conduct our business with offices throughout the world, providing us with a pre-eminent global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets
	activities. Our growth has been driven by value that we have created through our operationally focused investment approach, the expansion of our existing businesses, our entry into new lines of
	business, innovation in the products that we offer investors in our funds, an increased focus on providing tailored solutions to our clients and the integration of capital markets distribution
	activities.




	        As
	a global investment firm, we earn management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees for providing investment management, monitoring and other services to our funds, vehicles,
	managed accounts, specialty finance company and portfolio companies, and we generate transaction-specific income from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income from investing
	our own capital alongside that of our fund investors and from other principal investments and from the carried interest we receive from our funds and certain of our other investment vehicles. A
	carried interest entitles the sponsor of a fund to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested.




	        We
	seek to consistently generate attractive investment returns by employing world-class people, following a patient and disciplined investment approach and driving growth and value
	creation in the assets we manage. Our investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are supported by a substantial and diversified capital base, an integrated global investment platform, the
	expertise of operating consultants and senior advisors and a worldwide network of business relationships that
	provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. We believe that these

	Table of Contents





	aspects
	of our business will help us continue to expand and grow our business and deliver strong investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions.





	Business Segments







	Private Markets






	        Through our Private Markets segment, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity funds and co-investment vehicles that invest
	capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. We also manage and source investments in real assets, such as infrastructure,
	energy and real estate. These funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC registered investment adviser.






	Public Markets






	        We operate our credit and hedge funds businesses through the Public Markets segment. Our credit business is managed by KKR Asset
	Management, LLC, or KAM, an SEC registered investment adviser. KAM advises funds, structured finance vehicles, separately managed accounts, BDCs and other investment companies registered under
	the Investment Company Act that invest capital in (i) leveraged credit strategies, such as leveraged loans and high yield bonds and (ii) alternative credit strategies such as mezzanine
	investments, special situations investments, direct lending investments and long/short credit. In addition, on February 19, 2014, KKR acquired Avoca, a leading European credit investment
	manager with approximately $8.4 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2013.




	        In
	addition to our credit business, we have a hedge funds business that offers a variety of investment strategies and focuses on providing investment solutions for institutional
	investors. These strategies are managed by KAM and Prisma Capital Partners LP, or KKR Prisma, an SEC registered investment adviser. This business offers customized hedge fund portfolios, hedge
	fund-of-fund solutions and a long/short equity strategy. In addition, on January 23, 2013, we acquired a 24.9% interest in Nephila, an investment manager focused on investing in natural
	catastrophe and weather risk.






	Capital Markets and Principal Activities






	        Our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment combines KKR's principal assets with our global capital markets business.




	        Our
	capital markets business employs approximately 45 executives and supports our firm, our portfolio companies and third-party clients by developing and implementing both traditional
	and non-traditional capital solutions for investments or companies seeking financing. These services include arranging debt and equity financing for transactions, placing and underwriting securities
	offerings and providing other types of capital markets services. When we underwrite an offering of securities or a loan on a firm commitment basis, we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities or
	indebtedness and generate revenue by purchasing the securities or indebtedness at a discount or for a fee. When we act in an agency capacity, we generate revenue for arranging financing or placing
	securities or debt with capital markets investors. To allow us to carry out these activities, we are registered or authorized to carry out certain broker-dealer activities in various countries in
	North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Our third party capital markets activities are generally carried out through Merchant Capital Solutions LLC, a joint venture with two
	other unaffiliated partners and non-bank financial companies, or NBFCs, in India.




	        KKR's
	principal assets, which include investments in our investment funds and co-investments in certain portfolio companies of such funds, provide us with a significant source of capital
	to further grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our existing portfolio of businesses and further align our interests with those of our fund investors and other stakeholders. The
	majority of our




	108











	Table of Contents





	principal
	assets consist of general partner interests in KKR investment funds, limited partner interests in certain KKR private equity funds, co-investments in certain portfolio companies of such
	private equity funds, and other assets we acquired in the KPE Transaction, with the remaining holdings
	consisting of assets held in the development of our business, including seed capital for new strategies and other opportunistic investments. We believe that the market experience and skills of
	professionals in our capital markets business and the investment expertise of professionals in our Private Markets and Public Markets segments will allow us to continue to grow and diversify this
	asset base over time.





	Business Environment





	        As a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and elsewhere
	in the world. Global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting both the success of the investments we make as well as
	our ability to exit these investments profitably and to make new investments. While certain economies experienced moderate expansion in 2013, the current global economic environment remains uncertain.
	Within Europe, there is a divergence between stronger growth in Germany, and weaker or negative growth in other countries. Overall, Europe has experienced negative growth trends as sovereign debt
	concerns have affected consumer and business behavior which has pushed the region into recession. Fiscal deficits and the levels of government debt in a number of European countries have led to
	substantial increases in sovereign borrowing costs, stresses in the European banking system, and associated reductions in the availability of credit and economic activity in the euro area. Through the
	course of 2013, fiscal restraint, deficit reductions, and central bank support have alleviated some of the stresses and borrowing costs have receded. However, these issues may resurface if there is
	not continual progress in structural reforms, fiscal consolidation, and other matters. Ongoing austerity and deleveraging in the developed world are likely to persist in the near-term, but at a slower
	pace. Importantly, periods of deleveraging tend to be accompanied by increased volatility in the global capital markets, which may pose downside risk to the economic outlook. While a number of policy
	actions have been taken which seek to address the European sovereign debt crisis, if one or more Eurozone members were to leave the Eurozone, the functioning of Europe's single market currency could
	be undermined which would cause a deeper and more damaging impact on the global economy. Growth in Asian economies is mixed. For example, the rate of real gross domestic product growth in China
	remains lower compared to the pace of growth in prior years. In addition, the new Chinese leadership has signaled that its reform agenda is more important than growth, and regulatory and structural
	adjustments could further impair growth. The U.S. economy grew moderately in 2013, but continues to be restrained by various headwinds. For example, while unemployment has declined, the unemployment
	rate remains elevated and consumer and business spending has been cautious. In the wake of recent fiscal tightening in the U.S., including the temporary U.S. government shutdown, U.S. consumers could
	further retrench spending, and while central banks around the world adopt quantitative easing, the U.S. dollar could continue to appreciate, which could impact U.S. corporate profitability as well as
	curtail U.S. growth. The U.S. Federal Reserve has also announced a shift in monetary policy by initiating the tapering of quantitative easing. Uncertainty surrounding the pace and timing of tapering
	could cause interest rates to rise which could affect our investments.




	        In
	addition, foreign exchange rates can materially impact the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and rising U.S. interest rates
	may negatively impact certain foreign currencies that depend upon foreign capital flows. For example, the Japanese yen, Indian rupee and Australian dollar depreciated 17.6%, 11.1% and 14.2% against
	the U.S. dollar, respectively in 2013. Furthermore, higher interest rates and weaker currencies in some emerging market
	currencies may increase country default risk. Within credit markets, spreads have tightened significantly while issuance has reached record levels in 2013. If interest rates rise sharply, or growth
	remains weak, default risk may rise. Moreover, while our Private Markets business invested or committed over




	109











	Table of Contents





	$8.5 billion
	in new transaction activity during 2013 through February 18, 2014, levels of transaction activity are generally volatile, and reduced levels of transaction activity tend to
	result in a reduced amount of transaction fees and potential future investment gains.




	        In
	addition to economic conditions, global equity markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as equity prices, which have been and may
	continue to be volatile, significantly impact the valuation of our portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment income that we recognize. For our investments that are publicly listed and thus
	have readily observable market prices, global equity markets have a direct impact on valuation. For other investments, these markets have an indirect impact on valuation as we typically utilize a
	market multiples valuation approach as one of the methodologies to ascertain fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. In addition, the receptivity of equity
	markets to initial public offerings, or IPOs, as well as subsequent equity offerings by companies already public, impacts our ability to realize investment gains. For example, during the first quarter
	of 2014, we have been able to complete an IPO for Santander Consumer USA (NYSE: SC) and complete secondary sales of common shares of Kion Group AG (XETRA: KGX), ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (XETRA: PSM)
	and NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI).




	        Notwithstanding
	the trends described above, global equity markets rose during the year ended December 31, 2013, with the S&P 500 Index up 32.4% and the MSCI World Index up
	27.4%. Equity market volatility declined during the year ended December 31, 2013 as evidenced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, a measure of volatility,
	beginning the year at 18.0 and ending at 13.7 on December 31, 2013. The below-investment grade credit markets trailed the equity markets, with the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index up 5.3% and the
	BoAML HY Master II Index up 7.4% during the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively.




	        Conditions
	in global credit markets also have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on the ability of our funds to obtain committed debt
	financing on favorable terms in order to complete new private equity and other transactions. Similarly, our portfolio companies regularly require access to the global credit markets in order to obtain
	financing for their operations and to refinance or extend the maturities of their outstanding indebtedness. To the extent that conditions in the credit markets render such financing difficult to
	obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact the operating performance and valuations of those portfolio companies and, therefore, our investment returns on our funds. In addition, during
	economic downturns or periods of slow economic growth, the inability to refinance or extend the maturities of portfolio company debt (and thereby extend our investment holding period) may hinder our
	ability to realize investment gains
	from these portfolio companies when economic conditions improve. Credit markets can also impact valuations. For example, we typically use a discounted cash flow analysis as one of the methodologies to
	ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. If applicable interest rates rise, as was the case in 2013, then the assumed cost of capital for those
	portfolio companies would be expected to increase under the discounted cash flow analysis, and this effect would negatively impact their valuations if not offset by other factors. Conversely, a fall
	in interest rates can positively impact valuations of certain portfolio companies if not offset by other factors. These impacts could be substantial depending upon the magnitude of the change in
	interest rates. In certain cases, the valuations obtained from the discounted cash flow analysis and the other primary methodology we use, the market multiples approach, may yield different and
	offsetting results. For example, the positive impact of falling interest rates on discounted cash flow valuations may offset the negative impact of the market multiples valuation approach and may
	result in less of a decline in value than for those investments that had a readily observable market price. Finally, low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation may also
	negatively impact expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases.

	Table of Contents





	        Our
	Public Markets segment manages a number of funds and other accounts that invest capital in a variety of credit and equity strategies, including leveraged loans, high yield bonds and
	mezzanine debt. As a result, conditions in global credit and equity markets have a direct impact on both the performance of these investments as well as the ability to make additional investments on
	favorable terms in the future.




	        In
	addition, our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment generates fees through a variety of activities in connection with the issuance and placement of equity and debt
	securities and credit facilities, with the size of fees generally correlated to overall transaction sizes. As a result, the conditions in global equity and credit markets, as well as transaction
	activity in our Private Markets segment and to a lesser extent, Public Markets segment, impact both the frequency and size of fees generated by this segment.




	        Finally,
	conditions in commodity markets impact the performance of our portfolio companies in a variety of ways, including through the direct or indirect impact on the cost of the inputs
	used in their operations as well as the pricing and profitability of the products or services that they sell. The price of commodities has historically been subject to substantial volatility, which
	among other things, could be driven by economic, monetary, political or weather related factors. If certain of our portfolio companies are unable to raise prices to offset increases in the cost of raw
	materials or other inputs, or if consumers defer purchases of or seek substitutes for the products of such portfolio companies, such portfolio companies could experience lower operating income which
	may in turn reduce the valuation of those portfolio companies. However, the results of operations and valuations of certain of our other portfolio companies, for example those involved in the
	development of oil and natural gas properties, may benefit from an increase or suffer from a decline in commodity prices. In particular, our Private Markets portfolio contains several real asset
	investments whose values are influenced by the price of
	natural gas and oil. While near-term natural gas and oil prices rose during the year ended December 31, 2013, long-term pricing of such real assets was by comparison more stable. The valuations
	of these real asset investments generally increase or decrease with the increase or decrease, respectively, of such long-term commodities prices as well as individual company performance. Furthermore,
	as we make additional investments in oil and gas companies and assets, the value of our portfolio may become increasingly sensitive to oil and gas prices.





	Basis of Accounting





	        The consolidated financial statements, referred to hereafter as our "financial statements," include the accounts of KKR's management
	and capital markets companies, the general partners of certain unconsolidated funds, general partners of consolidated funds and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities.




	        In
	accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, certain entities, including a substantial number of our funds, are consolidated
	notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest or non-economic variable interest in those entities. In particular, the majority of our consolidated funds consist of funds
	in which we hold a general partner or managing member interest that gives us substantive controlling rights over such funds. With respect to our consolidated funds and vehicles, we generally have
	operational discretion and control, and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating activities of the fund, including the ability to remove the general
	partner, also known as kick-out rights. As of December 31, 2013, our Private Markets segment included 21 consolidated investment funds and 17 unconsolidated co-investment vehicles. Our Public
	Markets segment included 11 consolidated investment vehicles and 53 unconsolidated vehicles.

	Table of Contents





	        When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated entity on a gross basis.
	While the consolidation of a consolidated fund does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital that KKR reports, the consolidation does
	significantly impact the financial statement presentation. This is due to the fact that the assets, liabilities, fees, expenses and investment income of the consolidated funds are reflected on a gross
	basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests are reflected as single line items. The single line items in which the assets, liabilities, fees,
	expenses and investment income attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income
	attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations. For a further discussion of our consolidation policies, see "Critical Accounting
	PoliciesConsolidation."





	Key Financial Measures







	Fees






	        Fees consist primarily of (i) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital
	markets activities, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance and other vehicles,
	and separately managed accounts, (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies, and (iv) consulting and other fees earned by consolidated entities from providing
	advisory and other services. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services
	are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control.
	These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.




	        Fees
	reported in our consolidated financial statements do not include the management or incentive fees that we earn from consolidated funds, because those fees are eliminated in
	consolidation. However, because those management fees are earned from, and funded by, third-party investors in our funds who hold noncontrolling interests in the consolidated funds, net income
	attributable to KKR is increased by the amount of the management fees that are eliminated in consolidation. Accordingly, while the consolidation of funds impacts the amount of fees that are recognized
	in our financial statements, it does not affect the ultimate amount of net income attributable to KKR or KKR's partners' capital.




	        For
	a further discussion of our fee policies, see "Critical Accounting PoliciesRevenue Recognition."






	Expenses







	Compensation and Benefits





	        Compensation and benefits expense includes cash compensation consisting of salaries, bonuses, and benefits, as well as equity-based
	compensation consisting of charges associated with the vesting of equity-based awards and carry pool allocations.




	        All
	KKR principals and other employees of certain consolidated entities receive a base salary that is paid by KKR or its consolidated entities, and is accounted for as compensation and
	benefits expense. These employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance, overall profitability and other matters. While cash bonuses paid to most employees are
	borne by KKR and certain consolidated entities and result in customary compensation and benefits expense, cash bonuses that are paid to certain of KKR's principals are currently borne by KKR Holdings.
	These bonuses are




	112











	Table of Contents





	funded
	with distributions that KKR Holdings receives on KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings but are not then passed on to holders of unvested units of KKR Holdings. Because KKR principals
	are not entitled to receive distributions on units that are unvested, any amounts allocated to principals in excess of a principal's vested equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and
	benefits expense. These compensation charges are recorded based on the unvested portion of quarterly earnings distributions received by KKR Holdings at the time of the distribution.




	        With
	respect to KKR's active and future funds and co-investment vehicles that provide for carried interest, KKR allocates to its principals and other professionals a portion of the
	carried interest earned as part of its carry pool. KKR currently allocates approximately 40% of the carry it earns from these funds and vehicles to its carry pool. For the purpose of the discussion
	under "Consolidated Results of Operations," these amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit-sharing arrangements in conjunction with the related carried interest income and
	recorded as compensation and benefits expense for KKR employees and general, administrative and other expense for certain non-employee consultants and service providers in the consolidated statements
	of operations. However, for the purposes of the discussion under "Segment Analysis," carry pool allocations are recorded as a component of Investment Income (Loss).





	General, Administrative and Other





	        General, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and
	consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and other
	general and operating expenses which are not borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds. General,
	administrative and other expense also consists of costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions, a substantial portion of which are
	borne by fund investors.






	Investment Income (Loss)







	Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities





	        Net gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment
	activities. The majority of our net gains (losses) from investment activities are related to our private equity investments. Fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between
	reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. The fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains
	from, our private equity investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given
	period. Upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. Since our
	investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. For a further discussion of our fair value
	measurements and fair value of investments, see "Critical Accounting PoliciesFair Value Measurements."





	Dividend Income





	        Dividend income consists primarily of distributions that investment funds receive from portfolio companies in which they invest.
	Dividend income is recognized primarily in connection with (i) dispositions of operations by portfolio companies, (ii) distributions of excess cash generated from operations from
	portfolio companies and (iii) other significant refinancings undertaken by portfolio companies.

	Table of Contents






	Interest Income





	        Interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our cash balances, principal assets and credit instruments in which
	our consolidated funds invest.





	Interest Expense





	        Interest expense is incurred from debt issued by KKR, credit facilities entered into by KKR, and debt outstanding at our consolidated
	funds entered into with the objective of enhancing returns or managing cash flow, which are generally not direct obligations of the general partners of our consolidated funds or management companies.
	In addition to these interest costs, we capitalize debt financing costs incurred in connection with new debt arrangements. Such costs are amortized into interest expense using either the interest
	method or the straight-line method, as appropriate. See "Liquidity".





	Income Taxes





	        The KKR Group Partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries operate in the United States as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes and as corporate entities in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Accordingly, these entities, in some cases, are subject to New York City unincorporated business taxes, or non-U.S. income taxes.
	Furthermore, we hold our interest in one of the KKR Group Partnerships through KKR Management Holdings Corp., which is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and certain other
	wholly-owned subsidiaries of the KKR Group Partnerships are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, such wholly-owned subsidiaries of KKR, including KKR Management
	Holdings Corp., and of the KKR Group Partnerships, are subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to KKR's share of this
	income is reflected in the financial statements. We also generate certain interest income to our unitholders and interest deductions to KKR Management Holdings Corp., as a result of a 2011
	recapitalization of KKR Management Holdings Corp.




	        We
	use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
	tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and
	liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
	valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.




	        Tax
	laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense
	and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available.






	Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests






	        Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in entities that
	are consolidated in the financial statements as well as the ownership interests in our KKR Group Partnerships that are held by KKR Holdings. The allocable share of income and expense attributable to
	these interests is accounted for as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Historically, the amount of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests has been
	substantial and has resulted in significant charges and credits in the statements of operations. Given the consolidation of certain of our investment funds and the significant ownership interests in
	our KKR Group Partnerships held by KKR Holdings, we expect this activity to continue.

	Segment Operating and Performance Measures






	        The segment key performance measures that follow are used by management in making operating and resource deployment decisions as well
	as assessing the overall performance of each of KKR's reportable business segments. The reportable segments for KKR's business are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss)
	between KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR Holdings L.P. and as such represent the business in total. In addition, KKR's reportable segments are presented without giving effect to the
	consolidation of the funds that KKR manages.




	        Certain
	of the following financial measures in this report are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing these
	performance
	measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to unitholders in assessing the overall performance of KKR's businesses. These financial measures should not be considered as a
	substitute for similar financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP if available. We caution readers that these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of other
	investment managers, and as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
	comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, where applicable, are included within "Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 12. Segment
	Reporting" and later in this report under "Segment Book Value."





	Fee Related Earnings ("FRE")





	        Fee related earnings is comprised of segment fees less segment expenses (other than certain compensation and general and administrative
	expenses incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income). This measure is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating earnings of KKR and its business
	segments before investment income. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of our fee generating management companies and
	capital markets businesses. The components of FRE on a segment basis differ from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a consolidated basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned
	from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the
	amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations; (v) the exclusion of non-cash equity charges and other non-cash compensation charges
	borne by KKR Holdings or incurred under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan ("Equity Incentive Plan"); (vi) the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses; and
	(vii) the exclusion of certain non-recurring items.





	Economic Net Income (Loss) ("ENI")





	        Economic net income (loss) is a measure of profitability for KKR's reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative
	measurement of the operating and investment earnings of KKR and its business segments. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the overall profitability
	of KKR's businesses inclusive of investment income and carried interest. ENI is comprised of: (i) FRE; plus (ii) segment investment income (loss), which is reduced for carry pool
	allocations, management fee refunds, interest expense and certain compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income; less
	(iii) certain economic interests in KKR's segments held by third parties. ENI differs from net income (loss) on a GAAP basis as a result of: (i) the exclusion of the items referred to in
	FRE above; (ii) the exclusion of investment income (loss) relating to noncontrolling interests; and (iii) the exclusion of income taxes.

	Assets Under Management ("AUM")





	        Assets under management represent the assets from which KKR is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest and general partner
	capital. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds. KKR calculates the
	amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds plus uncalled capital commitments from these funds; (ii) the fair value of
	investments in KKR's co-investment vehicles; (iii) the net asset value of certain of KKR's credit products; (iv) the value of outstanding structured finance vehicles; and (v) the
	fair value of other assets managed by KKR. KKR's definition of AUM is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts
	that it manages or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions.





	Fee Paying AUM ("FPAUM")





	        Fee paying AUM represents only those assets under management from which KKR receives fees. We believe this measure is useful to
	unitholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. This relates to KKR's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment
	funds, for only those funds where KKR receives fees (i.e., excluding vehicles that receive only carried interest or general partner capital). FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases
	that are used to calculate KKR's fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets from which KKR does not receive a fee are excluded (i.e., assets with respect to which it
	receives only carried interest) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because
	fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments.





	Committed Dollars Invested





	        Committed dollars invested is the aggregate amount of capital commitments that have been invested by KKR's investment funds and
	carry-yielding co-investment
	vehicles and is used as a measure of investment activity for KKR and its business segments during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight
	into KKR's investment of committed capital. Such amounts include: (i) capital invested by fund investors and co-investors with respect to which KKR is entitled to a carried interest and
	(ii) capital invested by KKR's investment funds and vehicles.





	Gross Dollars Invested





	        Gross dollars invested is the aggregate amount of capital that has been invested by all of our Public Markets investment vehicles in
	our private credit non-liquid strategies and is used as a measure of investment activity for our Public Markets in a given period. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides
	additional insight into our Public Markets investment of capital across its private credit non-liquid strategies for all the investment vehicles which it manages. Such amounts include:
	(i) capital invested by fund investors and co-investors with respect to which our Public Markets Segment is entitled to a fee or carried interest and (ii) internal and proprietary
	capital invested by our Public Markets investment funds and vehicles.

	Syndicated Capital





	        Syndicated capital is generally the aggregate amount of capital in transactions originated by KKR investment funds and carry-yielding
	co-investment vehicles, which has been distributed to third parties in exchange for a fee. It does not include (i) capital invested in such transactions by KKR investment funds and
	carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which is instead reported in committed dollars invested and (ii) debt capital that is arranged as part of the acquisition financing of transactions
	originated by KKR investment funds. Syndicated capital is used as a measure of investment activity for KKR and its business segments during a given period, and we believe that this measure is useful
	to unitholders as it provides additional insight into levels of syndication activity in KKR's Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment and across its investment platform.





	Uncalled Commitments





	        Uncalled commitments are used as a measure of unfunded capital commitments that KKR's investment funds and carry-paying co-investment
	vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital
	that is available to KKR's investment funds and vehicles to make future investments.





	Adjusted Units





	        Adjusted units are used as a measure of the total equity ownership of KKR that is held by KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR
	Holdings and represent the fully diluted unit count using the if-converted method. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides an indication of the total equity ownership of KKR as
	if all outstanding KKR Holdings units had been exchanged for common units of KKR & Co. L.P.





	Book Value





	        Book value is a measure of the net assets of KKR's reportable segments and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized
	value of our investment portfolio, including carried interest, as well as our overall liquidity position. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the
	assets and liabilities of KKR excluding the assets and liabilities that are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders in our consolidated funds. Book value differs from
	KKR & Co. L.P. partners' capital on a GAAP basis primarily as a result of the exclusion of ownership interests attributable to KKR Holdings L.P.





	Cash and Short-Term Investments





	        Cash and short-term investments represent cash and liquid short-term investments in high-grade, short-duration cash management
	strategies used by KKR to generate additional yield on our excess liquidity and is used by management in evaluating KKR's liquidity position. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it
	provides additional insight into KKR's
	available liquidity. Cash and short-term investments differ from cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis as a result of the inclusion of liquid short-term investments in cash and short-term
	investments. The impact that these liquid short-term investments have on cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from
	operating activities. Accordingly, the exclusion of these investments from cash and cash equivalents on a GAAP basis has no impact on cash provided (used) by operating activities, investing activities
	or financing activities. As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of approximately $2.2 billion. Excluding approximately $0.9 billion of
	liquid short-term investments, cash and short-term investments may be reconciled to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2013.

	Year ended December 31, 2013 compared to year ended December 31, 2012







	Fees





	        Fees were $762.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $194.1 million, compared to fees of
	$568.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The net increase was primarily due to an increase in management fees of $79.8 million, an increase in transaction fees of
	$50.3 million and an increase in incentive fees of $24.8 million. The increase in management fees was primarily the result of the acquisition of Prisma as well as new capital raised
	primarily in our Public Markets segment. The increase in transaction fees was primarily driven by an increase in the size and number of fee-generating investments completed during the year ended
	December 31, 2013 in our Private Markets segment. During the year ended December 31, 2013, there were 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of
	approximately $15.0 billion compared to 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion during the year ended
	December 31, 2012. Transaction fees vary by




	118











	Table of Contents





	investment
	based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role
	in the transaction. The increase in incentive fees is due primarily to an increase in incentive fees received from Prisma, which became part of KKR during the three months ended December 31,
	2012, partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees from KFN as a result of its investment performance. KFN has already realized a substantial majority of the unrealized gains that were embedded in
	its bank loan and high yield portfolio, which have contributed in the past to its investment performance and KKR's receipt of incentive fees from KFN. Incentive fees from KFN are determined quarterly,
	while other incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Due to the scheduled payments of such fees,
	incentive fees can generally be expected to be larger in the fourth quarter than in the second quarter assuming performance thresholds have been met. Whether an incentive fee from KFN and other KKR
	vehicles is payable in any given period, and the amount of an incentive fee payment, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result may vary significantly from period to
	period.





	Expenses





	        Expenses were $1,767.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $168.3 million, compared to
	$1,598.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in general, administrative and other expenses of $179.1 million, partially
	offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expenses of $14.3 million. The
	increase in other general, administrative and other expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional service fees in connection with the growth of our business, the acquisition of Prisma as
	well as a $9.7 million one-time expense incurred in our Public Markets business in connection with the launch of a closed-end fund during the year ended December 31, 2013. The net
	decrease in compensation and benefits is due primarily to (i) lower equity-based compensation reflecting fewer KKR Holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded
	attribution method of expense recognition, partially offset by (ii) an increase in cash-based compensation as a result of the Prisma acquisition, increased headcount and an increase in fees and
	(iii) higher equity-based compensation relating to additional equity grants under the Equity Incentive Plan.







	Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities





	        Net gains from investment activities were $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, essentially flat compared to
	$7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. The following is a summary of net gains (losses) from investment activities:

	        The
	most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 is related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair
	value in our private equity investments. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.0 billion, $1.3 billion
	and $1.1 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and European Fund III, respectively. Approximately 46% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2013 was
	attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc. (NYSE: HCA), ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and NXP Semiconductors N.V.,
	partially offset by decreases relating to Bharti Infratel Ltd. (BOM: 534816) and China Outfitters Holdings (HK: 1146). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value,
	with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH (healthcare sector), Academy Sports and Outdoors (retail sector) and Oriental Brewery (consumer products
	sector). The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Samson Resources (energy sector), Toys R Us (retail sector)
	and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. (transportation sector). The increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market
	comparables and individual
	company performance and (ii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously
	announced transaction. The decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook.




	        The
	most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities in our private equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2012 is related to unrealized gains
	and losses from changes in fair value. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.4 billion, $1.9 billion and
	$0.9 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 24% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to
	changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation (NYSE: DG) and NXP Semiconductors N.V., which were
	partially offset by decreases in Seven West Media Ltd. (AX: SWM), Far Eastern Horizon Ltd. (HK: 3360) and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. (HK: 1252). Our private portfolio

	Table of Contents





	contributed
	the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH
	(manufacturing sector), which were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation (financial services sector) and Toys R Us, Inc. The
	increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that
	primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the
	respective companies.





	Dividend Income





	        Dividend income was $695.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $245.4 million, compared to
	dividend income of $940.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received dividends of $191.6 million from Capsugel
	(healthcare sector), $139.7 million from Pets at Home (consumer products sector), $113.9 million from Visma (technology sector), $85.6 million from Tarkett S.A.
	(manufacturing sector), $52.0 million from Santander Consumer USA and an aggregate of $112.7 million of dividends from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2012,
	we received $520.0 million of dividends from HCA, Inc., $188.1 million from Academy Sports and Outdoors, $95.0 million from SunGard (technology sector),
	$78.5 million from TDC A/S (OMX: TDC), and an aggregate of $59.3 million of dividends from other investments. Significant dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring
	quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable.





	Interest Income





	        Interest income was $474.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $116.2 million, compared
	to $358.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase primarily reflects a net increase in the level of credit instruments in our Public Markets investment vehicles.





	Interest Expense





	        Interest expense was $99.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $30.4 million, compared to
	$69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in debt obligations in connection with our 2043 Senior Notes issued on
	February 1, 2013.





	Income (Loss) Before Taxes





	        Due to the factors described above, principally a decrease in dividends in investment income, an increase in expenses, partially offset
	by an increase in fees, income before taxes was $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $0.2 billion, compared to income before taxes of
	$8.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012.





	Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests





	        Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests was $62.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an
	increase of $27.3 million, compared to $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase primarily reflects a higher level of investment income in vehicles that
	allow for redemptions by their limited partners.

	Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests





	        Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $7.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of
	$0.3 billion, compared to $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by the overall changes in the components of net gains (losses) from
	investment activities described above as well as a decrease in KKR Holdings's ownership percentage in the KKR Group Partnerships.





	Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P.





	        Net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. was $691.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013,
	an increase of $130.4 million, compared to $560.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in
	KKR & Co. L.P.'s ownership percentage in the KKR Group Partnerships from 36.9% on December 31, 2012 to 41.6% on December 31, 2013.






	Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011







	Fees





	        Fees were $568.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $155.2 million, compared to fees of
	$723.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net decrease was primarily due to a decrease in transaction fees of $106.1 million and a decrease in
	monitoring fees of $73.3 million, which were partially offset by a $17.9 million increase in management fees. The decrease in transaction fees was primarily due to a decrease in the
	number and size of investments completed in our Private Markets segment and to a lesser extent a decrease in overall capital markets transaction activity. In our Private Markets segment, during 2012
	there were 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion as compared to 19 transaction fee-generating investments with a
	total combined transaction value of approximately $24.9 billion during 2011. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction
	size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. In our capital markets business, the transaction fees we receive
	will depend on the amount of capital our funds and other vehicles deploy, the amount of capital this business syndicates and the number of transactions it completes for third party clients. The
	decrease in monitoring fees was primarily the result of $76.6 million of fees received in 2011 from the termination of monitoring fee arrangements in connection with the IPOs of
	HCA, Inc. and The Nielsen Company B.V. (NYSE: NLSN), and the sale of Seven Media Group (media sector), while no such termination payments were received in 2012. These types of
	termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with IPO or other sale activity in our private equity portfolio. Also contributing to
	the decrease in monitoring fees was a decrease in expense reimbursements in connection with monitoring of portfolio companies of $16.2 million. The decrease in monitoring fees from termination
	payments and expense reimbursements was partially offset by an increase in recurring monitoring fees of $31.0 million. The increase in recurring monitoring fees was primarily the result of an
	increase in the number of portfolio companies paying a monitoring fee and an increase in the average size of the fee. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we had 40 portfolio companies that
	were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.9 million compared with 36 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.3 million during the year ended
	December 31, 2011. The increase in management fees was primarily due to an increase relating to the acquisition of Prisma as well as increases relating to new capital raised primarily in our
	Public Markets segment.

	Expenses





	        Expenses were $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $0.4 billion, compared to
	$1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a net increase in compensation and benefits of $0.4 billion due to (i) higher
	carried interest being allocated to the carry pool for employees during 2012 as compared to the prior period as a result of a higher level of investment income and (ii) higher equity-based
	compensation relating to equity grants under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, partially offset by (iii) lower equity-based compensation reflecting fewer KKR
	Holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes under the graded attribution method of expense recognition.







	Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities





	        Net gains from investment activities were $7.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of
	$6.9 billion, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily driven by a higher level of net appreciation in our private equity
	portfolio in the current period when compared to the prior period. The following is a summary of net gains (losses) from investment activities:

	        The most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities in our private equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2012 is
	related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of
	$3.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $0.9 billion in our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 24% of the net change in value for the year ended
	December 31, 2012 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation and
	NXP Semiconductors N.V., which were partially offset by decreases in Seven West Media Ltd., Far Eastern Horizon Ltd. and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. Our private
	portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH,
	which were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation and Toys R Us, Inc. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase
	in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a
	portion of the investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies.




	        The
	most significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities in our private equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2011 is related to unrealized gains
	and losses from changes in fair value. The net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $0.9 billion and $0.4 billion
	in our 2006 Fund and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 78% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2011 was
	attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in Dollar General Corporation, The Nielsen Company B.V. and Jazz
	Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAZZ), partially offset by decreases in Legrand Holdings S.A. (ENXTPA: LR), Sealy Corporation (NYSE: ZZ) and Ma Anshan Modern Farming Co. (HK:
	1117). Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributor being unrealized gains relating to Oriental Brewery and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. These
	unrealized gains were partially offset by unrealized losses relating to Biomet, Inc. (healthcare sector) and Energy Future Holdings Corp. (energy sector). The increased valuations, in the
	aggregate, generally related to individual company performance, while the decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to declines in market comparables due to overall declines in equity
	markets or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook.





	Dividend Income





	        Dividend income was $940.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $715.8 million, compared
	to dividend income of $225.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we received $520.0 million of dividends from
	HCA, Inc., $188.1 million from Academy Sports and Outdoors, $95.0 million from SunGard, $78.5 million from TDC A/S, and an aggregate of $59.3 million of dividends
	from other investments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received $82.4 million of dividends from Dollar General Corporation, $68.3 million from Tarkett S.A.
	(manufacturing sector), $29.4 million from TDC A/S, $26.2 million from Legrand Holdings S.A. and an aggregate of $18.8 million of dividends from other investments. These
	types of dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends and may occur in the future; however, their size and frequency are variable.





	Interest Income





	        Interest income was $358.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $36.7 million, compared to
	$321.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase




	124











	Table of Contents





	primarily
	reflects a net increase in the level of credit instruments in our Public Markets investment vehicles.





	Interest Expense





	        Interest expense was $69.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $3.6 million, compared to
	$72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a net decrease in financing arrangements that were entered into by our consolidated funds with the
	objective of enhancing returns.





	Income (Loss) Before Taxes





	        Due to the factors described above, principally increased gains from investment activities, income before taxes was $8.1 billion
	for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $7.1 billion, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011.





	Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests





	        Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests was $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an
	increase of $30.7 million, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is due primarily to increases in the investment values of vehicles that
	allow for redemptions by limited partners, and to a lesser extent an increase in capital contributions as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.





	Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests





	        Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $7.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of
	$6.5 billion, compared to $0.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily driven by the overall changes in the components of net gains (losses) from
	investment activities described above.





	Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P.





	        Net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. was $560.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012,
	an increase of $558.9 million, compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net gains (losses) from
	investment activities as described above.

	Year ended December 31, 2013 compared to year ended December 31, 2012







	Fees





	        Fees were $593.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $53.6 million, compared to fees of
	$539.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The net increase was primarily due to an increase in transaction fees of $53.7 million and an increase in management fees of
	$35.6 million, partially offset by an increase in fee credits of $39.3 million. The increase in transaction fees was attributable to an increase in both the size and number of
	fee-generating investments completed. During the year ended December 31, 2013, there were 33 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately
	$15.0 billion compared to 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately $6.5 billion during the year ended December 31,
	2012. Transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of
	the transaction and KKR's role in the transaction. The increase in fee credits is primarily attributable to the increase in transaction fees, as described above. The increase in management fees is
	primarily attributable to new capital raised in KKR North America Fund XI and KKR Asian Fund II, partially offset by the KKR 2006 Fund and KKR Asian Fund entering their post-investment periods with a
	lower management fee. As of December 31, 2013, FPAUM excluded approximately $0.7 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan and
	$2.2 billion in commitments in connection with infrastructure, energy, private equity and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees. The inclusion of these
	amounts in FPAUM in future periods would be accretive to our fees. The investment period of our European Fund III ends on March 31, 2014, which will reduce the fund's fee rate and change the
	fund's management fee base from committed capital to invested capital. This will result in a decrease in fees earned for European Fund III beginning in the second quarter of 2014. This decrease will
	not be offset by a successor European private equity fund until such
	time as the successor fund has its first close and commences its investment period, which will occur after our European Fund III enters its post-investment period.





	Expenses





	        Expenses were $434.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $46.3 million, compared to
	expenses of $388.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in compensation and benefits in connection with the increase in
	fees, which generally results in higher compensation expense, as well as an increase in headcount.





	Fee Related Earnings





	        Fee related earnings were $158.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $7.3 million,
	compared to fee related earnings of $151.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was due to the increase in fees partially offset by increase in expenses and fees as
	described above.





	Investment Income (Loss)





	        Investment income was $795.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $111.6 million, compared
	to investment income of $684.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily driven by a lower level of management fee refunds.




	        Management
	fee refunds amounted to $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $113.4 million, as compared to $143.7 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in management fee refunds primarily reflects an increased level of accrued carried interest in




	127











	Table of Contents





	European
	Fund III and European Fund II in the year ended 2012 which triggered the recognition of a higher level of management fee refunds in the prior period.




	        Realized
	carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2013 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale and final sale of Dollar General Corporation, the
	partial sales of HCA, Inc. and sale of Intelligence, Ltd. (services sector).

	(a)




	The
	above table excludes any funds for which there was no unrealized carried interest during either of the periods presented, which for the year ended
	December 31, 2013, consisted of Asian Fund II.






	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2013, the net unrealized carried interest gain of $692.1 million included $1,174.6 million representing net increases in the value of
	various portfolio companies which were partially offset by $482.5 million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in the connection with the occurrence of
	realization events such as partial or full sales.




	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2013, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 20.2%. Increased share prices of various publicly held investments comprised
	approximately 46% of the net increase in value for the year ended December 31, 2013, the most significant of which were gains on HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and NXP
	Semiconductors N.V. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were Bharti Infratel Ltd. and
	China Outfitters Holdings. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Academy Sports and
	Outdoors and Oriental Brewery. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Toys R Us, Samson Resources, and U.N. RO-RO
	Isletmeleri A.S. The increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance
	and (ii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a previously announced transaction. The
	decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook.




	128





















	Table of Contents





	        The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted primarily from the partial sales and final sale
	of Dollar General Corporation, the partial sales of HCA, Inc. and sale of Intelligence, Ltd. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we wrote off PagesJaunes Group (media sector)
	(currently known as Solocal Group SA (FRA: QS3)) and our remaining warrants in Eastman Kodak (technology sector) and sold our remaining investment in Seven West Media Ltd. realizing a
	modest loss. None of these events had a material impact on our net carried interest.




	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2012, the net unrealized gains of $917.0 million included $1,141.1 million attributable to net increases in the value of various
	portfolio companies, partially offset by $224.1 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or
	full sales of investments.




	        Of
	the $1,141.1 million of net increases in value, 24% was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on
	HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation and NXP Semiconductors N.V. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of other publicly held investments, the most significant
	of which were Seven West Media Ltd., Far Eastern Horizon Ltd., and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most
	significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized
	losses relating to Samson Resources, China International Capital
	Corporation, and Toys R Us. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance
	Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an
	unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies.




	        The
	reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted primarily from the partial sale of Alliance Boots GmbH, sale of
	Legrand Holdings S.A. and partial sale of HCA, Inc.





	Economic Net Income (Loss)





	        Economic net income in our Private Markets segment was $952.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase
	of $120.8 million, compared to economic net income of $831.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in investment income as described above was the primary
	contributor to the period over period increase in economic net income.

	        AUM
	for the Private Markets segment was $61.2 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $12.1 billion, compared to $49.1 billion at December 31,
	2012. The increase was primarily attributable




	129











	Table of Contents





	to
	(i) new capital raised of $13.6 billion relating primarily to Asian Fund II commencing its investment period at which time it began recognizing management fees as well as additional
	capital raised in North America Fund XI, Energy Income and Growth Fund and Real Estate Partners Americas and (ii) appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio of
	$7.9 billion. The increases were partially offset by $9.2 billion in distributions to private equity fund investors comprised of $6.0 billion of realized gains and
	$3.2 billion of return of original cost.




	        The
	appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in
	our 2006 Fund, European Fund II and European Fund III, respectively. Approximately 46% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2013 was attributable to changes in share
	prices of various publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and NXP Semiconductors N.V., partially offset by decreases relating to Bharti
	Infratel Ltd and China Outfitters Holdings. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being unrealized gains relating to Alliance
	Boots GmbH, Academy Sports and Outdoors and Oriental Brewery. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to Samson Resources,
	Toys R Us and U.N RO-RO Isletmeleri A.S. The increased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and
	individual company performance and (ii) in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, in part due to the increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that may be delivered pursuant to a
	previously announced transaction. The decreased valuations of our private portfolio, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business
	outlook.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013, our AUM excluded approximately $0.7 billion of unallocated commitments from a strategic partnership with a state pension plan, and
	$2.2 billion in commitments in connection with other infrastructure, energy, private equity and co-investment vehicles for which we are currently not earning management fees. Such commitments
	will not contribute to AUM unless and until we are entitled to receive fees or carried interest in accordance with our definition of AUM.

	        FPAUM
	in our Private Markets segment was $50.2 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $9.0 billion, compared to $41.2 billion at December 31,
	2012. The increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised of $13.2 billion relating primarily to Asian Fund II which commenced its investment period at which time it began recognizing
	management fees as well as additional capital raised in North America Fund XI, Energy Income and Growth Fund and Real Estate Partners Americas, which were partially offset by distributions of
	$3.9 billion to private equity fund investors and a reduction of $0.7 billion reflecting the impact of certain funds entering the post-investment period.

	Table of Contents






	Committed Dollars Invested





	        Committed dollars invested were $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $2.8 billion
	compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was due to an increase in the number and size of private equity investments closed during the year ended
	December 31, 2013 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2012. In the year ended December 31, 2013, there were 70 transactions with a total combined transaction value of
	approximately $17.0 billion compared to 28 transactions with a total combined transaction value of approximately $7.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012.





	Uncalled Commitments





	        As of December 31, 2013, our Private Markets Segment had $20.1 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that
	could be called for investments in new transactions.






	Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011







	Fees





	        Fees were $539.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $76.3 million, compared to fees of
	$615.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in gross transaction fees of $70.2 million and a decrease in gross monitoring
	fees of $47.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in fee credits of $47.6 million. The decrease in gross transaction fees was primarily the result of a decrease in the number and
	size of fee-generating investments completed. In the year ended December 31, 2012, there were 17 transaction fee-generating investments with a total combined transaction value of approximately
	$6.5 billion compared to 19 transaction fee-generating investments with a combined transaction value of $24.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2011. Transaction
	fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular negotiations as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction
	and KKR's role in the transaction. The decrease in monitoring fees was primarily the result of $76.6 million of fees received in 2011 from the termination of monitoring fee arrangements in
	connection with the IPOs of HCA, Inc. and The Nielsen Company B.V., and the sale of Seven Media Group, while no such termination payments were received in 2012. These types of
	termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with IPO or other sale activity in our private equity portfolio. This decrease in
	monitoring fees from termination payments was partially offset by an increase in recurring monitoring fees of $31.0 million. The increase in recurring monitoring fees was primarily the result
	of an increase in the number of portfolio companies paying a monitoring fee and the average size of the fee. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we had 40 portfolio companies that were
	paying an average monitoring fee of $2.9 million compared with 36 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.3 million during the year ended December 31,
	2011.





	Expenses





	        Expenses were $388.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $0.7 million, compared to
	expenses of $389.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in other operating expenses related to a lower level of broken deal
	expenses, reflecting reduced transaction activity, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits in connection with increased headcount.





	Fee Related Earnings





	        Fee related earnings in our Private Markets segment were $151.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease
	of $75.6 million, compared to fee related earnings of $226.6 million for




	131











	Table of Contents





	the
	year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in fees as described above.





	Investment Income (Loss)





	        Investment income was $684.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $545.4 million, compared
	to investment income of $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was driven primarily by a higher level of net carried interest in our private equity funds.




	        Realized
	carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2012 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale of Alliance Boots GmbH, Legrand
	Holdings S.A. and HCA, Inc.




	        Realized
	carried interest for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted primarily of realized gains from the partial sale of Hilcorp Resources, LLC (energy sector),
	Legrand Holdings S.A. and Avago Technologies Limited (NYSE: AVGO).

	(a)




	The
	above table excludes any funds and vehicles for which there were no unrealized gains (losses) of carried interest during either of the periods
	presented.






	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2012, the net unrealized gains of $917.0 million included $1,141.1 million attributable to net increases in the value of various
	portfolio companies, partially offset by $224.1 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or
	full sales of investments.




	        Of
	the $1,141.1 million of net increases in value, 24% was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on
	HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation and NXP Semiconductors N.V. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of other publicly held investments, the most significant
	of which were Seven West Media Ltd., Far Eastern Horizon Ltd., and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most
	significant of which were gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio were partially offset by unrealized
	losses relating to Samson Resources, China International Capital Corporation, and Toys R Us. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and
	individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the




	132











	Table of Contents





	investment
	executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies.




	        The
	reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted primarily from the partial sale of Alliance Boots GmbH, sale of
	Legrand Holdings S.A. and partial sale of HCA, Inc.




	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2011, the net unrealized losses of $70.6 million included $247.9 million of reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains
	and losses in the connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial sales or write-offs which were partially offset by $177.3 million of net unrealized gains reflecting net
	increases in the value of various portfolio companies. The reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains and losses resulted primarily from the partial sales of Avago Technologies Limited,
	Legrand Holdings S.A. and Hilcorp Resources, LLC. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we wrote-off Capmark Financial Group, Inc. Of the $177.3 million of net
	increases in value, 80.3% was attributable to increased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were gains on Dollar General Corporation, The Nielsen
	Company B.V., and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. These increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were
	losses on HCA, Inc., Sealy Corporation and Ma Anshan Modern Farming Co. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains
	relating to Oriental Brewery and Intelligence Ltd. The increased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance. The unrealized gains on our private portfolio
	were partially offset by unrealized losses on Biomet, Inc. and Energy Future Holdings Corp. reflecting decreased valuations, in the aggregate, generally related to declines in the value of
	market comparables due to overall declines in equity markets or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook.




	        Management
	fee refunds amounted to $143.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $126.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2011.
	The increase in management fee refunds primarily reflects an increased level of accrued carried interest in European Fund III and European Fund II, which triggered the recognition of a higher level of
	management fee refunds.





	Economic Net Income (Loss)





	        Economic net income (loss) in our Private Markets segment was $831.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an
	increase of $468.9 million, compared to an economic net income of $362.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in investment income described above was the
	primary contributor to the period over period increase in economic net income.

	        AUM
	for the Private Markets segment was $49.1 billion at December 31, 2012, an increase of $5.5 billion, compared to $43.6 billion at December 31,
	2011. The increase was primarily attributable to appreciation in the market value of our private equity portfolio of $8.5 billion and new capital raised of $7.4 billion related
	principally to North America Fund XI. These increases were partially offset by distributions in our private equity portfolio of $9.0 billion, comprised of $6.1 billion of realized gains
	and $2.9 billion of return of original cost, as well as a reduction in the fee base of the 2006 Fund of $1.3 billion as a result of the 2006 Fund entering its post-investment period.




	        The
	change in value in our private equity portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $3.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $0.9 billion in our 2006 Fund,
	European Fund II and Asian Fund, respectively. Approximately 24% of the net change in value for the year ended December 31, 2012 was attributable to changes in share prices of various
	publicly-listed investments, most notably increases in HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation, and NXP Semiconductors N.V., which were partially offset by decreases in Seven West
	Media Ltd, Far Eastern Horizon Ltd and Tianrui Cement Co., Ltd. Our private portfolio contributed the remainder of the change in value, with the largest contributors being
	unrealized gains relating to Alliance Boots GmbH, Oriental Brewery and KION Group GmbH, which were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, China International Capital
	Corporation and Toys R Us, Inc. The increased valuations are generally related to an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, and in the case of Alliance
	Boots GmbH, an increase that primarily reflected the valuation of an agreement to sell a portion of the investment executed in June 2012. The decreased valuations are generally related to an
	unfavorable business outlook for the respective companies.

	        FPAUM
	in our Private Markets segment was $41.2 billion at December 31, 2012, an increase of $3.3 billion, compared to $37.9 billion at December 31,
	2011. The increase was primarily due to new
	capital raised of $7.5 billion relating primarily to North America Fund XI commencing its investment period at which time it began recognizing management fees. The increases were partially
	offset by the reduction in the fee base of the 2006 Fund of $3.2 billion as a result of the fund entering its post-investment period during which it earns management fees based on invested
	capital rather than committed capital at a lower rate as well as distributions of $1.1 billion.




	        As
	of December 31, 2012, our AUM and Fee Paying AUM excluded $4.0 billion relating to KKR Asian Fund II, $1.1 billion of unallocated commitments from a
	strategic partnership with a state pension plan, and $2.5 billion in connection with other infrastructure, energy and private equity funds and co-investment vehicles.

	Committed Dollars Invested





	        Committed dollars invested were $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $2.0 billion,
	compared to committed dollars invested of $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was due to a decrease in both the number and size of private equity investments
	closed during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. In the year ended December 31, 2012, there were 28 transactions with a total
	combined transaction value of approximately $7.3 billion compared to 38 transactions with a total combined transaction value of approximately $26.6 billion for the year ended
	December 31, 2011.





	Uncalled Commitments





	        As of December 31, 2012, our Private Markets Segment had $14.3 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that

	Year ended December 31, 2013 compared to year ended December 31, 2012







	Fees





	        Fees were $288.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $133.7 million, compared to fees of
	$155.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in management fees of $100.9 million and an increase in incentive fees
	of $28.5 million. The increase in management fees is due primarily to a full year of results for Prisma being reflected in 2013, the impact of our investment in Nephila, which was made during
	2013 and new capital raised. The increase in incentive fees is due primarily to (i) an increase in incentive fees received from Prisma, which became part of KKR during the three months ended
	December 31, 2012, (ii) incentive fees relating to our investment in Nephila and (iii) incentive fees from our KKR Equity Strategies platform. These increases were partially
	offset by a decrease in incentive fees from KFN as a result of its investment performance. KFN has already realized a substantial majority of the unrealized gains that were embedded in its bank loan
	and high yield portfolio, which have contributed in the past to its investment performance and KKR's receipt of incentive fees from KFN. Incentive fees from KFN are determined quarterly, while other
	incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Due to the scheduled payments of such fees, incentive fees
	can generally be expected to be larger in the fourth quarter than in the second quarter assuming performance thresholds have been met. Whether an incentive fee from KFN and other KKR vehicles is
	payable in any given period, and the amount of an incentive fee payment, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result may vary significantly from period to period.




	        On
	December 16, 2013, we, certain of our affiliates and KFN entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which KFN would become a subsidiary of KKR. Upon completion of this merger
	(which is subject to various conditions, including, among others things, obtaining the requisite approval of KFN's shareholders), KKR would no longer recognize management fees or incentive fees from
	KFN. Such management fees and incentive fees amounted to $40.4 million and $22.7 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2013. This reduction in fees may be offset
	in whole or in part, by investment income that is earned from KFN's business.





	Expenses





	        Expenses were $133.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $58.8 million, compared to
	expenses of $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase across all expense categories was primarily due to (i) the acquisition of Prisma, which became part of
	KKR during the three months ended December 31, 2012, (ii) a $9.7 million one-time expense incurred in our Public Markets business in connection with the launch of a closed-end
	fund and (iii) to a lesser extent an increase in operating expenses reflecting the continued growth of our Public Markets business.





	Fee Related Earnings





	        Fee related earnings were $155.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $74.9 million,
	compared to fee related earnings of $80.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was attributable to the increase in fees, partially offset by the increase in
	expenses, in each case as described above.





	Investment Income (Loss)





	        Investment income was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $14.0 million compared to
	investment income of $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is primarily attributable to higher net carried interest resulting from a larger increase in

	Table of Contents





	the
	net asset values of certain carry-eligible investment vehicles in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior period.





	Economic Net Income (Loss)





	        Economic net income was $191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $88.5 million,
	compared to economic net income of $102.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is attributable to the increase in both fee related earnings as well as investment
	income, partially offset by higher expenses as described above.

	        AUM
	in our Public Markets segment totaled $33.1 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $6.7 billion compared to AUM of $26.4 billion at
	December 31, 2012. The increase for the period was primarily due to $7.6 billion of new capital raised, primarily from our sub-advised BDC and our special situations fund, and a
	$1.8 billion increase in the net asset value of certain investment vehicles. These increases were partially offset by $2.7 billion of distributions and redemptions from certain
	investment vehicles.

	        FPAUM
	in our Public Markets segment was $27.2 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $7.5 billion compared to FPAUM of $19.7 billion at
	December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily due to $7.9 billion of new capital raised and a $1.5 billion increase in the net asset value of certain investment vehicles,
	partially offset by $1.9 billion of distributions and redemptions from certain investment vehicles.





	Committed Dollars Invested





	        Committed dollars invested were $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $0.8 billion,
	compared to committed dollars invested of $0.8 billion for the year ended December 31,




	138











	Table of Contents





	2012.
	The increase is primarily due to a higher level of net capital deployed, primarily in our special situations, direct lending and mezzanine strategies.





	Uncalled Commitments





	        As of December 31, 2013, our Public Markets segment had $2.4 billion of uncalled capital commitments that could be called
	for investments in new transactions.





	Gross Dollars Invested





	        Gross dollars invested were $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $2.5 billion,
	compared to gross dollars invested of $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is primarily due to a higher level of investment activity in our direct lending,
	mezzanine and special situations strategies.






	Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011







	Fees





	        Fees were $155.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $29.9 million, compared to fees of
	$125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in management fees of $20.2 million and incentive fees of
	$9.7 million. The increase in management fees is due primarily to the acquisition of Prisma and to a lesser extent new capital raised. The increase in incentive fees is due to incentive fees
	earned in our equity strategies business and hedge fund solutions platforms during 2012, neither of which businesses earned incentive fees in 2011, as well as an increase in incentive fees received
	from KFN resulting from a higher level of income when compared to the prior period.





	Expenses





	        Expenses were $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $9.0 million, compared to
	expenses of $65.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase across all expense categories was primarily due to the acquisition of Prisma and to a lesser extent an
	increase reflecting the continued expansion of our Public Markets business.





	Fee Related Earnings





	        Fee related earnings were $80.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $20.9 million,
	compared to fee related earnings of $59.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in fees, partially offset by the increase
	in expenses, as described above.





	Investment Income (Loss)





	        Investment income was $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $24.5 million compared to
	an investment loss of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is primarily attributable to higher net carried interest resulting from an increase in the net asset
	values of certain carry-eligible investment vehicles.





	Economic Net Income (Loss)





	        Economic net income was $102.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $44.9 million,
	compared to economic net income of $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase is attributable to the increase in both investment income as well as fee related
	earnings as described above.

	        FPAUM
	in our Public Markets segment was $19.7 billion at December 31, 2012, an increase of $11.2 billion compared to FPAUM of $8.5 billion at
	December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due
	to $8.1 billion relating to the acquisition of Prisma, $3.0 billion of new capital raised and a $0.9 billion increase in the net asset value of certain investment vehicles,
	partially offset by $0.9 billion of distributions and redemptions from certain investment vehicles.




	        As
	of December 31, 2012, our AUM and Fee Paying AUM excluded $0.4 billion relating to certain special situations and direct lending investment funds.





	Committed Dollars Invested





	        Committed dollars invested were $784.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $195.9 million,
	compared to committed dollars invested of $980.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease was due to a decrease in transactions closed during the year ended
	December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.

	Year ended December 31, 2013 compared to year ended December 31, 2012







	Fees





	        Fees were $146.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $17.1 million, compared to fees of
	$129.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Transaction fees increased primarily due to an increase in number of capital markets transactions in the year ended
	December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Overall, we completed 128 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2013 of which 16 represented
	equity offerings and 112 represented debt offerings, as compared to 102 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2012 of which 14 represented equity offerings and 88 represented debt
	offerings. We earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is
	separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we collect for
	like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets business is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices,
	credit spreads and volatility.





	Expenses





	        Expenses were $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $6.8 million, compared to
	expenses of $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was largely due to an increase in compensation and benefits related to higher fees as well as increased
	headcount in our capital markets business in connection with the growth of this segment.





	Fee Related Earnings





	        Fee related earnings were $98.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $10.4 million,
	compared to fee related earnings of $88.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in fees, partially offset by the increase
	in expenses, in each case as described above.







	Investment Income (Loss)





	        Investment income was $956.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $154.1 million, compared
	to investment income of $1,110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The following table reflects the components of investment income for the year ended December 31,

	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2013, net realized gains were comprised of $705.9 million of realized gains from the sale or partial sale of private equity investments, the
	most significant of which were HCA, Inc., Dollar General Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V. and Intelligence, Ltd. These realized gains were partially offset by
	$70.3 million of realized losses primarily related to the sale and write off of private equity investments, including the write-off of PagesJaunes Group. Realized investment losses from
	principal investments that were already written down as of October 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net realized gains (losses) above amounted to approximately $205 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2013. The net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most notably HCA, Inc., ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG
	and Alliance Boots GmbH, partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, as well as reversals of unrealized gains on the sale of Dollar General Corporation, HCA Inc. and The
	Nielsen Company B.V. For further discussion of private equity valuation changes, refer to "Private Markets Segment."




	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2012, net realized gains were comprised of $818.6 million of realized gains primarily from the sale of private equity investments, the most
	significant of which were the partial sales of Dollar General, Alliance Boots GmbH and HCA, Inc. These realized gains were partially offset by $102.7 million of realized losses
	primarily in connection with the sale of certain of our private equity interests. The net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most
	notably Alliance Boots GmbH, HCA, Inc., KION Group GmbH, and Dollar General Corporation. These unrealized gains were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, as
	well as reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in the connection with the occurrence of realization events.





	Economic Net Income (Loss)





	        Economic net income was $1,051.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of $144.5 million,
	compared to economic net income of $1,196.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in investment income described above was the primary contributor to the period over
	period decrease in economic net income.





	Syndicated Capital





	        Syndicated capital was $1,112.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $568.3 million
	compared to syndicated capital of $543.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is primarily due to an increase in the number and size of syndication transactions
	when compared to year ended December 31, 2012.






	Year ended December 31, 2012 compared to year ended December 31, 2011







	Fees





	        Fees were $129.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $41.3 million, compared to fees of
	$170.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. While we completed a greater number of capital markets transactions in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the prior
	year, transaction fees decreased primarily due to a lower level of syndicated capital as equity syndication transaction sizes were significantly higher for the year ended December 31, 2011 as
	compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Overall, we completed 102 capital markets transactions for the year ended December 31, 2012 of which 14 represented equity offerings and 88
	represented debt offerings, as compared to 72 transactions for the year ended December 31, 2011 of which 15 represented equity offerings and 57 represented debt offerings. We earned fees in
	connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. While each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates
	are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings,

	Table of Contents





	and
	the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. Our capital markets business is dependent on the overall capital markets environment,
	which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility.





	Expenses





	        Expenses were $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $1.3 million, compared to
	expenses of $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to a $3.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expense relating primarily
	to increased headcount which was partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses reflecting a lower level of professional fees.





	Fee Related Earnings





	        Fee related earnings were $88.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of $42.6 million,
	compared to fee related earnings of $130.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was primarily related to the decrease in fees as described above.







	Investment Income (Loss)





	        Investment income was $1,110.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $907.7 million,
	compared to investment income of $202.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The following table reflects the components of investment income (loss) for the years ended

	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2012, net realized gains were comprised of $818.6 million of realized gains primarily from the sale of private equity investments, the most
	significant of which were the partial sales of Dollar General, Alliance Boots GmbH and HCA, Inc. These realized gains were partially offset by $102.7 million of realized losses
	primarily in connection with the sale of certain of our private equity interests. The net unrealized gains related primarily to increases in the value of various private equity investments, most
	notably Alliance Boots GmbH, HCA, Inc., KION Group GmbH and Dollar General Corporation. These unrealized gains were partially offset by unrealized losses on Samson Resources, as
	well as reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in the connection with the occurrence of realization events.




	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2011, net realized gains were comprised of $345.1 million of realized gains from the sale of certain private equity investments, the most
	significant of which were Dollar General Corporation, HCA, Inc., Avago Technologies Limited, and Hilcorp Resources, LLC, partially offset by $193.4 million of realized losses
	primarily from the completion of the bankruptcy of Capmark Financial Group, Inc. The net unrealized gains were comprised of unrealized gains relating to the reversals of previously recognized
	unrealized losses related primarily to the completion of the bankruptcy of Capmark Financial Group, Inc. and net unrealized gains reflecting increases in the value of various private equity
	investments, most notably Dollar General Corporation and The Nielsen Company B.V. These net unrealized gains were offset by the reversals of previously recognized unrealized gains in connection
	with partial sales of private equity investments, most notably HCA, Inc. and Dollar General Corporation.

	Economic Net Income (Loss)





	        Economic net income was $1,196.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $866.0 million,
	compared to economic net income of $330.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in investment income described above was the primary contributor to the period over
	period increase in economic net income.

	Liquidity






	        We manage our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of our funds and the effect of
	normal changes in short term assets and liabilities, which we anticipate will be settled for cash within one year. Our primary cash flow activities on an unconsolidated basis typically involve:
	(i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, including the sale of investments and other principal assets; (iii) funding capital
	commitments that we have made to our funds, (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions;
	(v) underwriting commitments within our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our fund investors and unitholders; and (vii) borrowings, interest payments and
	repayments under credit agreements, our senior notes and other borrowing arrangements. As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and short-term investments on a segment basis of $2.2 billion.






	Sources of Liquidity






	        Our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from
	our funds, managed accounts, portfolio companies, capital markets transactions and other investment products; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds;
	(iii) realizations on and sales of investments and other principal assets; and (iv) borrowings under our credit facilities, debt offerings and other borrowing arrangements. In addition,
	we may generate cash proceeds from sales of our common units described below.




	        With
	respect to our private equity funds, carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback or net loss sharing provision only after all of
	the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns
	since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount
	sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. As of December 31, 2013, certain of our funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the
	third criteria. In these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a
	realization event. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments
	is referred to as a "netting hole." When netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions
	are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. Once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to
	the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost, or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest
	will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. A fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general
	partner upon the next realization event,
	which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next realization event would be expected to result in the payment of
	carried interest.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013, netting holes existed at certain of our private equity funds, the most significant of which were our domestic Millennium Fund partnership and domestic
	2006 Fund partnership, which had netting holes of approximately $200 million and $100 million, respectively. The domestic Millennium Fund partnership is not in position to pay cash
	carry. However, subsequent to December 31, 2013, we exited a portion of our investment in Santander Consumer USA. Pro forma for this event, the netting hole in our domestic 2006 Fund
	partnership was reduced to zero, and consequently, this fund is in position to pay cash carry upon a profitable realization event. However, in




	148











	Table of Contents





	accordance
	with the criteria set forth above, funds currently in position to pay cash carry may develop netting holes in the future and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase
	or decrease in the future. As of December 31, 2013, no private equity funds, other than the domestic Millennium Fund partnership and domestic 2006 Fund partnership had a netting hole greater
	than $50 million.




	        We
	have access to funding under various credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the
	capital markets. The following is a summary of the principal terms of these sources of funding.





	Revolving Credit Agreements





	        For the year ended December 31, 2013, there were no borrowings made, and as of December 31, 2013, no borrowings were
	outstanding under either of the revolving credit agreements described below, except for a letter of credit under the Corporate Credit Agreement described further below. We may, however, utilize these
	facilities prospectively in the normal course of our operations.






	




	On February 26, 2008, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. entered into a credit agreement with
	a major financial institution (the "Corporate Credit Agreement"). The general partners of our private equity funds are guarantors under this agreement. The Corporate Credit Agreement originally
	provided for revolving borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, with a $50.0 million sublimit for swing-line notes and a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. On
	February 22, 2011, the parties amended the terms of the Corporate Credit Agreement such that effective March 1, 2011, availability for borrowings under the credit facility was reduced
	from $1.0 billion to $700 million and the maturity was extended to March 1, 2016. In addition, the KKR Group Partnerships became co-borrowers of the facility, and
	KKR & Co. L.P. and the issuer of the 2020 Senior Notes (discussed below) became guarantors of the Corporate Credit Agreement, together with certain general partners of our private
	equity funds. On June 3, 2011, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to admit a new lender, subject to the same terms and conditions, to provide a commitment of $50 million. This
	commitment increased the availability for borrowings under the credit facility to $750 million. On June 22, 2012, KKR requested the issuance of a letter of credit in the amount of
	$14.5 million under the Corporate Credit Agreement. The beneficiary of this letter of credit is an unaffiliated third party. The letter of credit was issued on July 2, 2012 and initially
	set to expire on July 3, 2013. On August 20, 2012, the letter of credit in connection with this fee-generating transaction was increased to $20.0 million and the expiration date
	was extended to August 1, 2013. On July 23, 2013, the expiration date was extended to August 1, 2014. A $5.0 million sublimit for letters of credit remains available under
	the Corporate Credit Agreement.








	




	On February 27, 2008, KKR Capital Markets entered into a credit agreement with a major financial institution (the
	"KCM Credit Agreement") for use in KKR's capital markets business. The KCM Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for revolving borrowings of up to $500 million with a $500 million
	sublimit for letters of credit. On March 30, 2012, an agreement was made to extend the maturity of the KCM Credit Agreement from February 27, 2013 to March 30, 2017. In addition
	to extending the terms, certain other terms of the KCM Credit Agreement were renegotiated including a reduction of the cost of funding on amounts drawn and a reduced commitment fee. Borrowings under
	this facility may only be used for our capital markets business.







	Senior Notes







	




	On September 29, 2010, KKR Group Finance Co. LLC, a subsidiary of KKR Management Holdings Corp.,
	issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes (the






	149











	Table of Contents







	"2020
	Senior Notes"), which were issued at a price of 99.584%. The 2020 Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the issuer and will mature on September 29, 2020, unless
	earlier redeemed or repurchased. The 2020 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by KKR & Co. L.P. and the KKR Group Partnerships. The
	guarantees are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors. The 2020 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per annum, accruing from September 29, 2010. Interest is
	payable semi-annually in arrears on March 29 and September 29 of each year.




	The
	indenture, as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, relating to the 2020 Senior Notes includes covenants, including limitations on the issuer's and the guarantors' ability to, subject to
	exceptions, incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The indenture,
	as supplemented, also provides for events of default and further provides that the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2020 Senior Notes may
	declare the 2020 Senior Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In the case of
	specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization, the principal amount of the 2020 Senior Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2020 Senior Notes automatically
	becomes due and payable. All or a portion of the 2020 Senior Notes may be redeemed at the issuer's option in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at
	the make-whole redemption price set forth in the 2020 Senior Notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the 2020 Senior Notes are subject to repurchase by the issuer at a repurchase price
	in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Senior Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2020 Senior Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date
	of repurchase.






	




	On February 1, 2013, KKR Group Finance Co. II LLC, a subsidiary of KKR Management Holdings Corp.,
	issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes (the "2043 Senior Notes"), which were issued at a price of 98.856%. The 2043 Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated
	obligations of the issuer and will mature on February 1, 2043, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The 2043 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by
	KKR & Co. L.P. and the KKR Group Partnerships. The guarantees are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors. The 2043 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of
	5.50% per annum, accruing from February 1, 2013. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year.








	The
	indenture, as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, relating to the 2043 Senior Notes includes covenants, including limitations on the issuer's and the guarantors' ability to, subject to
	exceptions, incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The indenture,
	as supplemented, also provides for events of default and further provides that the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2043 Senior Notes may
	declare the 2043 Senior Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In the case of
	specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization, the principal amount of the 2043 Senior Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2043 Senior Notes automatically
	becomes due and payable. All or a portion of the 2043 Senior Notes may be redeemed at the issuer's option in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at
	the make-whole redemption price set forth in the 2043 Senior Notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the 2043 Senior Notes are subject to repurchase by the issuer at a repurchase price
	in cash equal to 101% of the






	150











	Table of Contents







	aggregate
	principal amount of the 2043 Senior Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2043 Senior Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase.







	Common Units







	




	On April 12, 2013, KKR & Co. L.P. filed a registration statement with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission for the sale by us from time to time of up to 2,500,000 common units of KKR & Co. L.P. to generate cash proceeds (a) up to (1) the amount of
	withholding taxes, social benefit payments or similar payments payable by us in respect of awards granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan, and (2) the amount of cash delivered in respect
	of awards granted pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan that are settled in cash instead of common units; and (b) to the extent the net proceeds from the sale of common units exceeds the
	amounts due under clause (a), for general corporate purposes. The administrator of the Equity Incentive Plan is expected to reduce the maximum number of common units eligible to be issued under
	the Equity Incentive Plan by the number of common units issued and sold pursuant to the registration statement unless such reduction is already provided for with respect to such awards under the terms
	of the Equity Incentive Plan. The Securities and Exchange Commission declared the registration statement effective on May 6, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, 844,073 common units
	have been issued and sold under the registration statement and are included in our basic common units outstanding as of December 31, 2013.








	Liquidity Needs






	        We expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to: (i) continue to grow our business, including
	seeding new strategies and funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies; (ii) service debt
	obligations that may give rise to future cash payments; (iii) fund cash operating expenses; (iv) pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings as
	described below; (v) make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy; (vi) underwrite commitments within our capital markets business and (vii) acquire
	additional principal assets, including the acquisition of other investment advisory and capital markets businesses. We may also require cash to fund contingent obligations including those under
	clawback, net loss sharing arrangements, contingent purchase price payments in connection with our acquisitions of or investments in equity stakes in other businesses or obligations in connection with
	the defense, prosecution, or settlement of legal claims. See "LiquidityContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis." We believe that the
	sources of liquidity described above will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.





	Capital Commitments





	        The agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital
	commitments to such funds, which usually range from 2% to 4% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds pursuing newer strategies. In addition, we are
	responsible for certain limited partner interests in some of our private

	equity
	funds. The following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds as of December 31, 2013:

	        As
	of December 31, 2013, KKR had unfunded commitments consisting of (i) $1,172.0 million to its active private equity and other investment vehicles,
	(ii) $83.7 million in connection with commitments by KKR's capital markets business and (iii) $161.0 million relating to Merchant Capital Solutions as described below and
	certain other investment commitments. Whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part depends on the terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to
	funding.




	        In
	addition to the commitments described above, KKR has earmarked approximately $430 million to fund, acquire and develop new strategies, products and initiatives including
	energy, real estate, alternative credit and other strategies. The amounts earmarked to fund and develop new strategies, products and initiatives may be revised or terminated by KKR in its discretion
	from time to time.





	Prisma Capital Partners





	        On October 1, 2012, KKR acquired all of the equity interests of Prisma. KKR may become obligated to make future purchase price
	payments in the years 2014 and 2017 based on whether the Prisma business grows to achieve certain operating performance metrics when measured in such years. KKR has the right in its sole discretion to
	pay a portion of such future purchase price payments, if any, in KKR & Co. L.P. common units rather than in cash.





	Merchant Capital Solutions





	        Merchant Capital Solutions LLC ("MCS", formerly known as "MerchCap Solutions LLC") is a joint venture partnership with
	Stone Point Capital ("Stone Point") and CPPIB Credit Investments, Inc. ("CPPIB"). MCS seeks to provide capital markets services to mid-market and sponsor-backed companies as well as make
	certain principal investments to support client needs. KKR and Stone Point each committed $150 million of equity and CPPIB committed an additional $50 million to MCS to support its
	business. KKR expects that certain capital markets activities for third parties (other than KKR and its Portfolio Companies) will be principally conducted by MCS.

	Acquisition of Avoca Capital





	        On February 19, 2014, KKR closed its previously announced acquisition of Avoca Capital and its affiliates ("Avoca"), a European
	credit investment manager with approximately $8.4 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2013. The purchase price was payable by KKR at the closing in cash, and/or
	securities representing the right to receive up to approximately 5.0 million KKR & Co. L.P. common units.





	Acquisition of KFN





	        On December 16, 2013, KKR, affiliates of KKR and KFN, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"),
	pursuant to which KFN would become a subsidiary of KKR Fund Holdings (the "Merger"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. KFN is managed by KKR Financial
	Advisors LLC, a subsidiary of KKR, pursuant to a management agreement. Completion of the merger is subject to various conditions.




	        At
	the effective time of the merger, each common share of KFN issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (excluding any common shares held by KKR Fund Holdings or any
	of its subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive 0.51 KKR common units together with cash in lieu of fractional units.





	Tax Receivable Agreement





	        We and certain intermediate holding companies that are taxable corporations for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, may
	be required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with KKR Holdings. KKR Management Holdings L.P. made an election under Section 754
	of the Internal Revenue Code that will remain in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units for common units occurs, which may result in an increase in our
	intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the assets of the KKR Group Partnerships at the time of an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units. Certain of these exchanges are expected to
	result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the
	goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available. This increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce
	the amount of income tax our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future. This increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future
	dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.




	        We
	have entered into a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings, which requires our intermediate holding companies to pay to KKR Holdings, or to executives who have exchanged KKR
	Holdings units for KKR common units as transferees of KKR Group Partnership Units, 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate holding
	companies realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of increases in tax
	basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. A termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to
	realize in connection with such events. In the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire KKR Group Partnership Units in the future, or if we
	become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect that each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms.




	        These
	payment obligations are obligations of our intermediate holding companies and not the KKR Group Partnerships. As such, cash payments received by common unitholders may vary from




	153











	Table of Contents





	those
	received by current and former holders of KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings and our current and former principals to the extent payments are made to those parties under the tax
	receivable agreement. Payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required to be made within 90 days of the filing of the tax returns of our intermediate holding companies, which may
	result in a timing difference between the tax savings received by KKR's intermediate holdings companies and the cash payments made to the selling holders of KKR Group Partnership Units.




	        For
	the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, cash payments that have been made under the tax receivable agreement were $4.7 million, $2.7 million and
	$0.2 million, respectively. We expect our intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. As of December 31,
	2013, $1.3 million of cumulative income tax savings have been realized.





	Distributions





	        In April 2013, we amended our distribution policy to provide for the quarterly distribution of a percentage of net realized principal
	investment income as described below. The distribution of net realized principal investment income replaces the annual, additional distribution that was historically announced in connection with
	fourth quarter earnings. This additional distribution was intended to cover certain tax liabilities, as calculated by us, and as a result of the change in distribution policy, we expect that such
	additional distributions will no longer be made, although the board of directors of the general partner of KKR & Co. L.P. may decide otherwise from time to time.




	        We
	intend to make quarterly cash distributions in amounts that in the aggregate are expected to constitute substantially all of the cash earnings of our investment management business
	and 40% of the net cash income from our realized principal investments, in each case in excess of amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to
	make appropriate investments in our business and our investment funds and to comply with applicable law and any of our debt instruments or other obligations. For purposes of our distribution policy,
	distributions are expected to consist of (i) FRE, (ii) carry distributions received from our investment funds which have not been allocated as part of our carry pool and (iii) a
	percentage of net realized principal investment income. This amount is expected to be reduced by (i) corporate and applicable local taxes, if any, (ii) non-controlling interests, and
	(iii) amounts determined by us to be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of our business and other matters as discussed above.




	        The
	declaration and payment of any distributions are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the general partner of KKR & Co. L.P., which may change
	the distribution policy at any time, and the
	terms of its limited partnership agreement. There can be no assurance that distributions will be made as intended or at all or that unitholders will receive sufficient distributions to satisfy payment
	of their tax liabilities as limited partners of KKR & Co. L.P. When KKR & Co. L.P. receives distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships (the holding
	companies of the KKR business), KKR Holdings receives its pro rata share of such distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships.

	Net Realized Principal Investment Income





	        Net realized principal investment income refers to net cash income from (i) realized investment gains and losses excluding
	certain realized investment losses from principal investments to the extent unrealized losses on these investments were recognized prior to the combination with KPE on October 1, 2009,
	(ii) dividend income and (iii) interest income net of interest expense less certain compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized
	principal investment income, in each case generated by KKR's principal investments held on or through KKR's balance sheet in our Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment. This is a term to
	describe a portion of KKR's quarterly distribution. Realized investment losses from principal investments that were already written down as of October 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net
	realized principal investment income as described above in (i) above amounted to approximately $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

	Table of Contents






	Total Distributable Earnings





	        Total distributable earnings is the sum of (i) FRE, (ii) carry distributions received from KKR's investment funds which
	have not been allocated as part of its carry pool and (iii) net realized principal investment income; less (i) applicable local income taxes, if any, and (ii) noncontrolling
	interests. We believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides a supplemental measure to assess performance, excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses), and also assess amounts
	available for distribution to KKR unitholders. However, total distributable earnings is not a measure that calculates actual distributions under KKR's current distribution policy.




	        Total
	distributable earnings were $1,455.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $6.5 million, compared to $1,449.4 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in realized cash carry of $214.3 million and an increase in fees of $204.4 million, largely
	offset by a decrease in net realized principal investment income of $209.6 million, an increase in realized cash carry allocated to carry pool of $85.7 million and increase in
	compensation and benefits of $71.0 million.




	        Total
	distributable earnings were $1,449.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $666.8 million, compared to $782.6 million for the
	year ended December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net realized principal investment income of $680.5 million and an increase in realized cash carry
	of $138.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in fees of $87.8 million and an increase in realized cash carry allocated to carry pool of $55.5 million.





	Other Liquidity Needs





	        We may also be required to fund various underwriting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of
	loans, securities or other financial instruments. We generally expect that these commitments will be syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances
	elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own account.








	Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on an Unconsolidated Basis






	        In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. The following table
	sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of December 31, 2013 on an unconsolidated basis:

	(1)




	These
	uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by us to fund a portion of the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds
	which are actively investing. Because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. However, given the size of such commitments and
	the rates at which

	our
	investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. See "LiquidityLiquidity Needs."

	These
	interest obligations on debt represent estimated interest to be paid over the maturity of the related debt obligation, which has been calculated
	assuming the debt outstanding at December 31, 2013 is not repaid until its maturity. Future interest rates are assumed to be those in effect as of December 31, 2013, including both
	variable and fixed rates, as applicable, provided for by the relevant debt agreements. The amounts presented above include accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness.

	        The
	commitment table above excludes contractual amounts owed under the tax receivable agreement, because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts due are not presently known. As of
	December 31, 2013, a payable of $89.8 million has been recorded in due to affiliates in the consolidated financial statements representing management's best estimate of the amounts
	currently expected to be owed under the tax receivable agreement. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $7.6 million of cumulative cash payments have been made under the tax receivable
	agreement. See "Liquidity NeedsTax Receivable Agreement."




	        The
	commitment table above excludes contingent consideration payments that may be owed in connection with acquisitions and other investments because the ultimate amounts due are not
	presently
	known. As of December 31, 2013, the recorded amounts of these contingent consideration obligations were approximately $156.7 million.




	        The
	commitment table above excludes amounts recorded for litigation matters because the ultimate amount and timing of the amounts to be paid, if any, are not presently known. See the
	consolidated financial statements of KKR and the related notes included elsewhere in this report.




	        In
	the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide general indemnifications. In addition, certain of our
	consolidated funds have provided certain indemnities relating to environmental and other matters and have provided nonrecourse carve-out guarantees for fraud, willful misconduct and other customary
	wrongful acts, each in connection with the financing of certain real estate investments that we have made. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims
	that may be made against us that have not yet occurred. However, based on prior experience, we expect the risk of material loss to be low.




	        The
	partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds, including funds and vehicles relating to private equity, mezzanine, infrastructure, energy, direct lending and special
	situations investments, generally include a "clawback" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for
	distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. Under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a fund, the general partner is required to return, typically on an after-tax
	basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry




	157











	Table of Contents





	distributions
	received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, including the effects of any performance thresholds.
	Excluding carried interest received by the general partners of funds that were not contributed to us in the KPE Transaction, as of December 31, 2013, no carried interest was subject to this
	clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry paying funds were liquidated at their December 31, 2013 fair values. Had the investments in such funds been liquidated at zero value, the
	clawback obligation would have been $1,350.7 million. Carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the
	fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are
	earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts
	earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner
	during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation,
	if any, is reflected as an increase in
	noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment
	balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded.




	        Certain
	private equity funds that were contributed to us in the KPE Transaction in 2009 also include a "net loss sharing provision." Upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to
	which a net loss sharing obligation applies, the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In these vehicles, such losses would be
	required to be paid by us to the fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed, and a greater
	share of investment losses would be allocable to us relative to the capital that we contributed to it as general partner. Based on the fair market values as of December 31, 2013, there would
	have been no net loss sharing obligation. If the vehicles were liquidated at zero value, the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately $496.4 million as of December 31,
	2013.




	        Prior
	to the KPE Transaction in 2009, certain of our principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to us had personally
	guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general
	partners' clawback obligations. The terms of the KPE Transaction require that our principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the KPE
	Transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Through investment realizations, this amount has been reduced to $217.8 million as of December 31, 2013. Using valuations as of
	December 31, 2013, no amounts are due with respect to the clawback obligation required to be funded by our principals. Carry distributions arising subsequent to the KPE Transaction may give
	rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to us and our principals who participate in the carry pool. Unlike the clawback obligation, we will be responsible for amounts due under a
	net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify our principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. In addition, guarantees of or similar arrangements
	relating to clawback or net loss sharing obligations in favor of third party investors in an individual investment partnership by entities we own may limit distributions of carried interest more
	generally.






	Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies on a Consolidated Basis






	        In the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash
	payments. The following table sets forth information

	relating

	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements






	        Other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any
	off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.






	Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows






	        The accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities which, in particular,
	include our consolidated funds notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those funds. The assets of our consolidated funds, on a gross basis, are substantially
	larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our
	consolidated funds involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with
	indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. Because our
	consolidated funds are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations.





	Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities





	        Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $2.6 billion, $6.2 billion and $(0.2) billion during
	the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts primarily included: (i) proceeds from sales of investments net of purchases of investments by our funds of
	$1.4 billion, $5.1 billion and $(0.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; (ii) net realized gains (losses) on investments of
	$3.9 billion, $5.2 billion and $3.3 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and (iii) change in unrealized gains (losses) on
	investments of $3.9 billion, $2.7 billion and $(2.3) billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Certain KKR funds are, for GAAP purposes,
	investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value.





	Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities





	        Our net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $15.5 million, $(220.9) million and $(47.6) million during the years
	ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our investing activities included the purchases of furniture, computer hardware and leasehold improvements of $14.4 million,
	$37.0 million and $18.2 million as well as a (decrease) increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents that primarily funds collateral requirements of $(29.9) million, $(2.9) million
	and $29.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively as well as cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $(186.9) million for the year ended
	December 31, 2012.

	Table of Contents






	Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities





	        Our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(2.5) billion, $(5.6) billion and $0.4 billion during the years
	ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our financing activities primarily included: (i) distributions to, net of contributions by our noncontrolling and redeemable
	noncontrolling interests, of $(2.8) billion, $(4.9) billion and $0.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; (ii) net proceeds received net
	of repayment of debt obligations of $0.8 billion, $(0.4) billion and $0.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively; and
	(iii) distributions to our partners of $(0.4) billion, $(0.2) billion and $(0.2) billion during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.





	Critical Accounting Policies





	        The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and
	judgments that affect the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. Our management bases these estimates and judgments on
	available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and
	may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the
	consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results
	if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions. Please see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further detail regarding our
	critical accounting policies.






	Principles of Consolidation






	        Our policy is to consolidate (i) those entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and
	control over significant operating, financial and investing decisions of the entity, including those private equity, credit, and other investment funds and their respective consolidated funds in which
	the general partner is presumed to have control or (ii) entities determined to be variable interest entities ("VIEs") for which we are considered the primary beneficiary.




	        With
	respect to the consolidated KKR funds, we generally have operational discretion and control, and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance and operating
	activities of the fund, including the ability to remove the general partner, also known as kick-out rights.




	        The
	consolidated KKR funds do not consolidate their majority owned and controlled investments in portfolio companies. Rather, those investments are accounted for as investments and
	carried at fair value as described below.




	        The
	KKR funds are consolidated notwithstanding the fact that we have only a minority economic interest in those funds. The consolidated financial statements reflect the assets,
	liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated KKR funds on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those funds, which are held by third
	party investors in our funds, are attributed to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. For funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including
	the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to KKR's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carried interest
	that KKR retains in net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. All of the
	management fees and certain other amounts earned by us from those funds are eliminated in consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from, and funded by, noncontrolling
	interests, our attributable share of the net income from those




	161











	Table of Contents





	funds
	is increased by the amounts eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination in consolidation of such amounts has no effect on net income (loss) attributable to us or our partners' capital.




	        Noncontrolling
	interests represent the ownership interests held by entities or persons other than us.





	Investments





	        Investments consist primarily of private equity, real assets, credit, equity method and other investments. Investments are carried at
	their estimated fair values, with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the condensed
	consolidated statements of operations. Investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are valued based on the spot rate of the respective currency at the end of the reporting period
	with changes related to exchange rate movements reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Security and loan
	transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Further disclosure on investments is presented in Note 4 "Investments" in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.




	        The
	following describes the types of securities held within each investment class.





	        Private Equity



	Consists primarily of equity investments in operating companies.





	        Real Assets



	Consists primarily of investments in (i) oil and natural gas properties ("energy"), (ii) infrastructure assets, and
	(iii) residential and commercial real estate assets and businesses ("real estate").





	        Credit



	Consists primarily of investments in below investment grade corporate debt securities (primarily high yield bonds and syndicated bank loans),
	distressed and opportunistic debt and interests in collateralized loan obligations.





	        Equity Method



	Consists primarily of investments in unconsolidated investment funds and vehicles that are accounted for using the equity method of
	accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the
	condensed consolidated statements of operations. Because the underlying investments of unconsolidated investment funds and vehicles are reported at fair value, the carrying value of our equity method
	investments representing KKR's interests in unconsolidated funds approximates fair value.





	        Other



	Consists primarily of investments in common stock, preferred stock, warrants and options of companies that are not private equity, real assets,
	credit or equity method investments.





	Fair Value Measurements





	        Investments and other financial instruments are measured and carried at fair value. The majority of investments and other financial
	instruments are held by the consolidated funds. Our funds and vehicles are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value. We have
	retained the specialized accounting for the consolidated funds and vehicles in consolidation. Accordingly, the unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the investments held
	by our funds and vehicles are reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.




	        For
	investments and other financial instruments that are not held in a consolidated fund or vehicle, we have elected the fair value option since these investments and other financial
	instruments are similar to those in the consolidated funds and vehicles. Such election is irrevocable and is applied on




	162











	Table of Contents





	an
	investment by investment basis at initial recognition. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities
	in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The methodology for measuring the fair value of such investments and other financial instruments is consistent with the methodologies applied to
	investments and other financial instruments that are held in consolidated funds and vehicles.




	        The
	carrying amounts of Other Assets, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities recognized on the statements of financial condition (excluding Fixed Assets, Goodwill,
	Intangible Assets, contingent consideration and certain debt obligations) approximate fair value due to their short term maturities. These items are presented in our financial statements included
	elsewhere in this report, specifically, information on Goodwill and Intangible Assets is presented in Note 14 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets," and information on contingent consideration is
	presented in Note 13 "Acquisitions." Our debt obligations, except for our 2020 and 2043 Senior Notes, bear interest at floating rates and therefore fair value approximates carrying value.
	Further information on our 2020 and 2043 Senior Notes are presented in Note 8 "Debt Obligations." The fair value for our 2020 and 2043 Senior Notes were derived using Level II inputs
	similar to those utilized in valuing credit investments.




	        Fair
	value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where
	available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation techniques are
	applied. These valuation techniques involve varying levels of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on a variety of factors. See Note 5 "Fair Value Measurements"
	for further information on our valuation techniques that involve unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the statements of financial condition are categorized based upon
	the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined under GAAP, are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs
	to the valuation of these assets and liabilities. The hierarchical levels defined under GAAP are as follows:






	Level I






	        Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The type of
	investments and other financial instruments included in this category are publicly-listed equities and debt and securities sold short. We classified 17.6% of total investments measured and reported at
	fair value as Level I at December 31, 2013.






	Level II






	        Inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level II
	inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. The type of investments and other financial
	instruments included in this category are credit investments, convertible debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives. We classified 8.4% of total
	investments measured and reported at fair value as Level II at December 31, 2013.






	Level III






	        Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset
	or liability. The types of assets and liabilities generally included in this category are private portfolio companies, real assets investments and credit investments for which a sufficiently liquid
	trading market does not exist. We classified 74.0% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as Level III at December 31, 2013. The valuation of our Level III
	investments at




	163











	Table of Contents





	December 31,
	2013 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments at such date.




	        In
	certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the
	fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance
	of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset.




	        A
	significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because
	in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly. In those circumstances, further
	analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value.




	        The
	availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument,
	whether the instrument has recently been issued, whether the instrument is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market, and current market conditions. To the extent that valuation is based
	on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining
	fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level III. The variability and availability of the observable inputs affected by the factors described above may cause transfers between
	Levels I, II, and III, which we recognize at the beginning of the reporting period.




	        Investments
	and other financial instruments that have readily observable market prices (such as those traded on a securities exchange) are stated at the last quoted sales price as of the
	reporting date. We do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price.






	Level II Valuation Methodologies






	        Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level II consist primarily of securities indexed to publicly-listed securities
	and credit and other investments. Credit investments generally have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the highest price that KKR and others are willing to
	pay for an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that KKR and others are willing to accept for an asset. For financial assets and liabilities whose inputs are based on bid-ask prices obtained
	from third party pricing services, fair value may not always be a predetermined point in the bid-ask range. Our policy is generally to allow for mid-market pricing and adjusting to the point within
	the bid-ask range that meets our best estimate of fair value. For securities indexed to publicly listed securities, such as convertible debt, the securities are typically valued using standard
	convertible security pricing models. The key inputs into these models that require some amount of judgment are the credit spreads utilized and the volatility assumed. To the extent the company being
	valued has other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the implied credit spread on the company's other outstanding debt securities would be utilized in the valuation. To the extent
	the company being valued does not have other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the credit spread will be estimated based on the implied credit spreads observed in comparable
	publicly-traded debt securities. In certain cases, an additional spread will be added to reflect an illiquidity discount due to the fact that the security being valued is not publicly-traded. The
	volatility assumption is based upon the historically observed volatility of the underlying equity security into which the convertible debt security is convertible and/or the volatility implied by the
	prices of options on the underlying equity security.

	Level III Valuation Methodologies






	        Management's determination of fair value is based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate
	assumptions that are management's best estimates after consideration of a variety of internal and external factors.




	        Financial
	assets and liabilities categorized as Level III consist primarily of the following:





	        Private Equity Investments:



	    We generally employ two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity
	investment. The first
	methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures. The second methodology utilized is
	typically a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for
	the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. Other inputs are also used in both methodologies. For
	valuations determined for periods other than at year end, various inputs may be estimated prior to the end of the relevant period. Also, as discussed in greater detail under "Business
	Environment," a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. In certain cases the results of the discounted cash flow approach can be significantly impacted by these
	estimates.




	        Upon
	completion of the valuations conducted using these methodologies, a weighting is ascribed to each method, and an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate. The
	ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within a range suggested by the two methodologies.




	        When
	determining the weighting ascribed to each valuation methodology, we consider, among other factors, the availability of direct market comparables, the applicability of a discounted
	cash flow analysis and the expected hold period and manner of realization for the investment. These factors can result in different weightings among investments in the portfolio and in certain
	instances may result in up to a 100% weighting to a single methodology. Across the Level III private equity investment portfolio, approximately 85% of the fair value is derived from investments
	that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. Less than 5% of the fair value of the Level III private equity investment portfolio is
	derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis. As of December 31, 2013, the overall weights ascribed to the market
	comparables methodology and the discounted cash flow methodology for our Level III private equity investments were 51% and 49%, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, we believe that the
	approach of using both the market multiples methodology and the discounted cash flow methodology resulted in valuations of our aggregate Level III private equity portfolio that were only
	marginally higher than if only the discounted cash flow methodology had been used and that were only marginally lower than if only the market comparables methodology had been used.




	        When
	determining the illiquidity discount to be applied, we seek to take a uniform approach across our portfolio and generally apply a minimum 5% discount to all private equity
	investments. We then evaluate such private equity investments to determine if factors exist that could make it more challenging to monetize the investment and, therefore, justify applying a higher
	illiquidity discount. These factors generally include (i) whether we are unable to sell the portfolio company or conduct an initial public offering of the portfolio company due to the consent
	rights of a third party or similar factors, (ii) whether the portfolio company is undergoing significant restructuring activity or similar factors and (iii) characteristics about the
	portfolio company regarding its size and/or whether the portfolio company is experiencing, or expected to experience, a significant decline in earnings. These factors generally make it less likely
	that a portfolio company would be sold or publicly offered in the near term at a price indicated by using just a market multiples and/or discounted cash flow analysis, and these factors tend to reduce
	the number of opportunities to sell an investment and/or increase the




	165











	Table of Contents





	time
	horizon over which an investment may be monetized. Depending on the applicability of these factors, we determine the amount of any incremental illiquidity discount to be applied above the 5%
	minimum, and during the time we hold the investment, the illiquidity discount may be increased or decreased, from time to time, based on changes to these factors. The amount of illiquidity discount
	applied at any time requires considerable judgment about what a market participant would consider and is based on the facts and circumstances of each individual investment. Accordingly, the
	illiquidity discount ultimately considered by a market participant upon the realization of any investment may be higher or lower than that estimated by us in our valuations.





	        Real Assets Investments:



	    For energy and infrastructure investments, we generally utilize a discounted cash flow analysis, which
	incorporates
	significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal
	values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. For real estate investments, we generally utilize a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant
	assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in these methodologies include an unlevered discount rate and terminal capitalization rate. The valuations of real assets investments also use
	other inputs. Certain investments in real estate and energy generally do not include a minimum illiquidity discount.





	        Credit Investments:



	    Credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not
	available,
	credit investments are valued by us based on ranges of values determined by an independent valuation firm. Valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses, for which the key inputs are
	determined based on market comparables, which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers.





	        Other Investments:



	    We generally employ the same valuation methodologies as described above for private equity investments when valuing
	these other
	investments.




	        Key
	unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our Level III investment valuations as described above are included in Note 5 "Fair Value Measurements." We
	utilize several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of its Level III investments. These unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by
	investment and in the application of our valuation methodologies. Our reported fair value estimates could vary materially if we had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and
	other assumptions or, for applicable investments,
	if we only used either the discounted cash flow methodology or the market comparables methodology instead of assigning a weighting to both methodologies.






	Level III Valuation Process






	        The valuation process involved for Level III measurements for private equity, real assets, credit, and other investments is
	completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level III investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review. We have a Private Markets
	valuation committee for private equity and real assets investments and a valuation committee for credit and other investments. The Private Markets valuation committee may be assisted by subcommittees
	for example in the valuation of real estate investments. Each of the Private Markets valuation committee and the credit valuation committee is assisted by a valuation team, which, except as noted
	below, is comprised only of employees who are not investment professionals responsible for preparing preliminary valuations or for oversight of any of the investments being valued. The valuation teams
	for energy, infrastructure and real estate investments contain investment professionals who participate in the preparation of preliminary valuations and oversight for those investments. The valuation
	committees and teams are responsible for coordinating and consistently implementing our quarterly valuation policies, guidelines and processes. For Private Markets investments classified as
	Level III, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial




	166











	Table of Contents





	and
	operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. These preliminary valuations are reviewed with the investment professionals by the
	applicable valuation team and are also reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by us to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of our valuations for all
	Level III investments in Private Markets, except for certain investments other than our private equity investments. For most investments classified as Level III in Public Markets, an
	independent valuation firm is generally engaged by us to provide third party valuations, or ranges of valuations from which our investment professionals select a preliminary valuation, or a third
	party firm is generally engaged by us to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of our valuations. All preliminary valuations in Private Markets and Public Markets are then
	reviewed by the applicable valuation committee, and after reflecting any input by their respective valuation committees, the preliminary valuations are presented to a single committee consisting of
	senior principals involved in various aspects of the our business. When these valuations are approved by this committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of Level III
	investments, as well as the valuations of Level I and Level II investments, are presented to the audit committee of our board of directors and are then reported on to the board of
	directors.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013, upon completion by an independent valuation firm of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them, the independent valuation firm concluded
	that the fair values, as determined by KKR, of Private Markets investments reviewed by them were reasonable. The limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of
	examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on certain Level III credit investments. We are responsible for determining the fair value of
	investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the
	fair value of the commensurate investments.




	        As
	described above, Level II and Level III investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs and our determinations of the fair values of
	these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. Additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of
	investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and partners' capital that we report
	from time to time.




	        Changes
	in the fair value of the investments of our consolidated private equity funds may impact the net gains (losses) from investment activities of our private equity funds as
	described under "Key Financial MeasuresInvestment Income (Loss)Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities." Based on the investments of our private equity
	funds as of December 31, 2013, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of the funds' investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains
	(losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or
	management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. The impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR would generally be
	significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent
	of our carried interest and our principal investments.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013, private equity investments which represented greater than 5% of consolidated investments consisted of Alliance Boots GmbH valued at
	$4.6 billion. On a segment basis, as of December 31, 2013, investments which represented greater than 5% of total reportable segments investments consisted of Alliance Boots GmbH,
	HCA Inc. and First Data Corporation, valued at $640.7 million, $287.3 million and $265.1 million, respectively.

	Revenue Recognition






	        Fees consist primarily of (i) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital
	markets activities, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance and other vehicles,
	and separately managed accounts, (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies and (iv) consulting and other fees earned by consolidated entities from providing
	advisory and other services. These fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services
	are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. Monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control.
	These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.




	        Certain
	of KKR's private equity funds require the management company to refund up to 20% of any cash management fees earned from limited partners in the event that the funds recognize a
	carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned or a portion thereof, a liability to the fund's limited
	partners is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the cash management fees earned. As of December 31, 2013, there is no carried
	interest subject to management fee refunds, which may reduce carried interest in future periods. The refunds to the limited partners are paid, and the liabilities relieved, at such time that the
	underlying investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized. In the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover any of the amount that represents 20% of the
	cash management fees earned, these fees would not be returned to the funds' limited partners, in accordance with the respective fund agreements.






	Recognition of Investment Income






	        Investment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments,
	(ii) dividends, (iii) interest income, (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward
	contracts, foreign currency options and foreign denominated debt. Unrealized gains or losses result from changes in fair value of investments during the period and are included in net gains (losses)
	from investment activities. Upon disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a realized gain or loss is recognized. While this reversal generally
	does not significantly impact the net amounts of gains (losses) that we recognize from investment activities, it affects the manner in which we classify our gains and losses for reporting purposes.




	        Due
	to the consolidation of the majority of our funds, the portion of our funds' investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the
	consolidated financial statements. For funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to KKR's carried
	interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carried interest that KKR retains in net income (loss) attributable to
	KKR & Co. L.P. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Because the substantial majority of our funds are consolidated and
	because we hold only a minority economic interest in our funds' investments, our share of the investment income generated by our funds' investment activities is significantly less than the total
	amount of investment income presented in the consolidated financial statements.






	Recognition of Carried Interest in Statement of Operations






	        Carried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative
	to the capital contributed by the general partner and




	168











	Table of Contents





	correspondingly
	reduces noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included as investment income (loss) in net gains (losses) from
	investment activities and are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been
	met. If these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as investment losses in net gains (losses) from investment
	activities.




	        Carried
	interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and
	liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those
	funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in
	subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed
	the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase
	in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment
	balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded. Due to the extended durations of our private equity funds, we believe that this
	approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds.






	Clawback Provision






	        The partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds, including funds relating to private equity, mezzanine, infrastructure,
	energy, real estate, direct lending and special situations investments, generally include a "clawback" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general
	partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. Under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a carry-paying fund, the general
	partner is required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry
	distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled including the effects of any performance hurdle.




	        Prior
	to the KPE Transaction, certain KKR principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to KKR had personally
	guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general
	partners' clawback obligations. The terms of the KPE Transaction require that KKR principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the KPE
	Transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Through investment realizations, this amount has been reduced to $217.8 million as of December 31, 2013. Carry distributions
	arising subsequent to the KPE Transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to KKR and KKR's principals who participate in the carry pool.






	Net Loss Sharing Provision






	        Certain private equity funds that were contributed to KKR in the KPE Transaction also include a "net loss sharing provision." Upon the
	liquidation of an investment vehicle to which a net loss sharing obligation applies, the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments.
	In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by KKR to fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any




	169











	Table of Contents





	carried
	interest had previously been distributed, and a greater share of investment losses would be allocable to us relative to the capital that we contributed to it as general partner. Unlike the
	clawback obligation, KKR will be responsible for all amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify KKR's principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with
	respect to such amounts.

	Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities






	        In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-11, "Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities" ("ASU
	2011-11"), which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01,
	which clarifies which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements established by ASU 2011-11. ASU 2011-11 was effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning
	January 1, 2013 and was applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on KKR's condensed consolidated financial statements.






	Goodwill Impairment Testing






	        In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, "IntangiblesGoodwill and Other," which provides the option to perform a
	qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the asset is considered impaired, an entity is
	required to perform the quantitative assessment under the existing guidance. The guidance was effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance, which is
	intended to simplify the impairment testing, did not have a material impact on KKR's financial statements.






	Disclosures About Reclassification Adjustments Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income






	        In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, "Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
	("AOCI")," which requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments, including: (i) changes in AOCI balances by component and (ii) significant items
	reclassified out of AOCI. ASU 2013-02 was effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, did not have a material
	impact on KKR's consolidated financial statements. AOCI is comprised of only one component, foreign currency translation adjustments, and for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, there
	were no items reclassified out of AOCI. See KKR's condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and changes in equity.






	Foreign Currency Matters






	        In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, "Foreign Currency Matters," which indicates that the entire amount of a cumulative
	translation adjustment ("CTA") related to an entity's investment in a foreign entity should be released when there has been a (i) sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign
	entity and the sale represents the substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity, (ii) loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign
	entity, and (iii) step acquisition for a foreign entity. This guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2014, and is to be applied prospectively. The adoption of
	this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's condensed consolidated financial statements.

	Amendments to Investment Company Scope, Measurement, and Disclosures






	        In June 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update 2013-08, "Financial
	ServicesInvestment Companies Topic 946" ("ASU 2013-08") which amends the scope, measurement, and disclosure requirements for investment companies. ASU 2013-08 (i) amends the
	criteria for an entity to qualify as an investment company, (ii) requires an investment company to measure noncontrolling ownership interests in other investment companies at fair value rather
	than using the equity method of accounting, and (iii) introduces new disclosures. This guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2014. Earlier application is
	prohibited. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's financial results and consolidated financial statements.















	ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK






	        Our exposure to market risks primarily relates to our role as general partner or manager of our funds and sensitivities to movements in
	the fair value of their investments, including the effect that those movements have on our management fees, carried interest and net gains from investment activities. We have an increased exposure to
	market risks as a result of our principal assets. The fair value of investments may fluctuate in response to changes in the values of investments, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.




	        The
	quantitative information provided in this section was prepared using estimates and assumptions that management believes are appropriate in order to provide a reader with an
	indication of the directional impact that a hypothetical adverse movement in certain risks would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. The actual impact of a
	hypothetical adverse movement in these risks could be materially different from the amounts shown below.




	        The
	firm uses various committees to help manage market risk and general business risks.





	Management of Market Risk





	        When we commit capital of a certain amount from our balance sheet to investments or transactions, a balance sheet committee of senior
	employees, including our two Co-Chief Executive Officers, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, must approve the transaction before it may be made. In addition, this committee
	supervises activities governing KKR's capital structure, liquidity, and other strategies for the composition of our balance sheet.




	        Certain
	securities transactions by our capital markets business are subject to risk tolerance limits, regulatory capital requirements and the review and approval of one or more
	committees in compliance with rules applicable to broker-dealers pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. When our capital is committed to capital markets transactions, after diligence is
	conducted, such transactions are subject to the review and approval of a capital markets underwriting committee. These transactions are also subject to risk tolerance limits. The risk tolerance limits
	establish the level of investment we may make in a single company or type of transaction, for example and are designed to avoid undue concentration and risk exposure. Regulatory capital requirements
	also place limits on the size of securities underwritings the capital markets business can conduct based on quantitative measure of
	assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items. Aggregate balance sheet risk is monitored on an ongoing basis by the balance sheet committee referenced above.




	        With
	respect to the funds and other investment vehicles through which we make investments for our fund investors, KKR manages risk by subjecting transactions to the review and approval
	of an applicable investment committee, and then a portfolio management committee (or other applicable senior employees) regularly monitors these investments. Before making an investment, investment
	professionals identify risks in due diligence, evaluating, among other things, business, financial, legal




	171











	Table of Contents





	and
	regulatory issues, financial data and other information. An investment team presents the investment and its identified risks to an investment committee, which must approve each investment before
	it may be made. If an investment is made, a portfolio management committee (or other applicable senior employees) is responsible for working with our investment professionals to monitor the investment
	on an ongoing basis.





	Management of General Business Risk





	        KKR has a risk committee comprised of senior employees from across our business segments and across business operations, and includes
	our Chief Administrative Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our General Counsel. The risk committee monitors and evaluates KKR's general business risks. The Chief Administrative Officer, who
	also serves as the chairman of the risk committee, regularly reports to our Co-Chief Executive Officers and quarterly to the Audit Committee, which is the chief committee that monitors risk on behalf
	of the Board of Directors. In addition, in 2013 we established a position dedicated to evaluating and monitoring market risk and coordinating such efforts across our businesses.




	        KKR's
	global conflicts and compliance committee is responsible for analyzing and addressing new or potential conflicts of interest that may arise in KKR's business, including conflicts
	relating to specific transactions and circumstances as well as those implicit in the overall activities of KKR and its various businesses and monitors compliance matters. Our Chief Administrative
	Officer and our General Counsel are members of this committee.




	        KKR's
	management committee is responsible for evaluating certain matters affecting the business of KKR. It consists of our Co-Chief Executive Officers, our Chief Administrative Officer,
	our Chief
	Financial Officer, our General Counsel and other senior principals across our business segments and across business operations, and is chaired by our Chief Administrative Officer. The management
	committee is responsible for approving the valuation of our Level III investments in Private and Public Markets.






	Market Risk






	        The majority of our investments are reported at fair value. Net changes in the fair value of investments impact the net gains (losses)
	from investment activities in our consolidated statements of operations. Based on the investments held as of December 31, 2013, we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of
	the investments generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities (except that carried interest would likely be more significantly
	impacted), regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. The impact that the consequential
	decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority
	of the change in fair value would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our principal investments and to a lesser
	extent our management fees. Because of this, the quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income
	attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. The actual impact to individual line items within the statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of
	(i) the elimination of management fees and carried interest and (ii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of the
	majority of our private equity and credit funds.




	        Based
	on the fair value of investments as of December 31, 2013, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would result in declines
	in net income

	An
	immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of investments would also impact our ability to earn incentive fees. Since the majority of our
	incentive fees are earned at December 31

	st

	of each calendar year and are not subject to clawback, a 10% decline in fair value would generally result in the recognition of no
	incentive fees on a prospective basis and result in lower net income relative to prior years where such incentive fees were earned.

	an annualized reduction in management fees.

	        Our
	management fees in our Private Markets investment funds are generally calculated based on the amount of capital committed or invested by a fund, as described under
	"BusinessOur SegmentsPrivate Markets." Accordingly, movements in the fair value of investments do not affect the amount of fees we may charge in these types of funds. In the
	case of our Public Markets business, management fees are often calculated based on the average NAV of the fund, vehicle, or specialty finance company, for that particular period, although certain
	funds in our Public Markets segment have management fees based on the amount of capital committed or invested. To the extent that management fees are calculated based on the NAV of the fund's
	investments, the amount of fees that we may charge will be increased or decreased in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the fair value of the fund's investments. The proportion of our
	management fees that are based on NAV depends on the number and type of funds in existence. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the approximate percentage of our fund management fees based on
	the NAV of the applicable funds or separately managed accounts, are as follows:

	Securities Market Risk






	        Our investment funds and principal assets hold certain investments in portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded. The
	market prices of securities may be volatile and are likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include actual or anticipated fluctuations in the quarterly and
	annual results of such companies or of other companies in the industries in which they operate, market perceptions concerning the availability of additional securities for sale, general economic,
	social or political developments, industry conditions, changes in government regulation, shortfalls in operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts, the general state of the
	securities markets and other material events, such as significant management changes, re-financings, acquisitions and dispositions. In addition, although our investments are comprised primarily of
	investments in portfolio companies whose securities are not publicly traded, the value of these




	173











	Table of Contents





	investments
	may also fluctuate due to similar factors beyond our control as described above for portfolio companies whose securities are publicly traded.






	Exchange Rate Risk






	        Our investment funds and principal assets hold investments in currencies other than those in which their capital commitments are
	denominated. Those investments expose us and our fund investors to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the capital
	commitments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. Additionally, a portion of our management fees are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Our policy is to minimize
	these risks by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce
	exposure to future changes in exchange rates when a meaningful amount of capital has been invested in currencies other than the currencies in which their capital commitments are denominated.




	        Because
	most of the capital commitments to our funds and KKR's capital are denominated in U.S. dollars, our primary exposure to exchange rate risk relates to movements in the value of
	exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies in which our investments are denominated (primarily euros, British pounds and Korean won), net of the impact of foreign exchange hedging
	strategies. The quantitative information that follows represents the impact that a reduction to each of the income streams shown below would have on net income attributable to
	KKR & Co. L.P. The actual impact to individual line items within the statements of operations would differ from the amounts shown below as a result of (i) the elimination
	of management fees and carried interest and (ii) the gross-up of net gains (losses) from investment activities, in each case as a result of the consolidation of the majority of our private
	equity and credit funds.




	        We
	estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were denominated as
	of December 31, 2013 would result in declines in net income attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. in 2014 from reductions in the following items, net of the impact of foreign
	exchange hedging strategies, if not offset by other factors:

	An
	immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and all of the major foreign currencies in which our investments were

	an annualized reduction in management fees.

	Credit Risk






	        We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that
	the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In these agreements, we depend on these counterparties to make payment or otherwise




	174











	Table of Contents





	perform.
	We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions to reputable financial institutions. In addition,
	availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets.






	Interest Rate Risk






	        We and our consolidated funds have debt obligations that include revolving credit agreements and certain investment financing
	arrangements structured through the use of term loans and revolving credit facilities that accrue interest at variable rates, and changes in these rates would affect the amount of interest payments
	that we would have to make, impacting future earnings and cash flows. Based on our debt obligations payable at December 31, 2013 (inclusive of debt obligations of our consolidated funds), we
	estimate that interest expense relating to instruments bearing variable rates would increase on an annual basis by $9.2 million in the event interest rates were to increase by a hypothetical
	100 basis points. Based on outstanding debt obligations at December 31, 2013, the estimated impact on interest expense is solely related to the debt obligations of our consolidated funds, a
	substantial portion of which is attributable to noncontrolling interests.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM






	To
	the Board of Directors and Unitholders of KKR & Co. L.P.:




	        We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of KKR & Co. L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and
	2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. We
	also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in



	Internal
	ControlIntegrated Framework (1992)



	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for
	these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
	assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
	express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.




	        We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
	obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
	respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
	understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
	based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
	opinions.




	        A
	company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
	persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
	and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
	policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
	(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
	receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
	prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.




	        Because
	of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
	misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
	future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




	        In
	our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of KKR & Co. L.P. and
	subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the




	177











	Table of Contents





	period
	ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
	respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in



	Internal ControlIntegrated
	Framework (1992)



	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	(All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where
	Noted)







	1. ORGANIZATION





	        KKR & Co. L.P. (NYSE:KKR), together with its consolidated subsidiaries ("KKR"), is a leading global investment firm that offers a broad range of investment
	management services to fund investors and provides capital markets services for the firm, its portfolio companies and other third parties. Led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, KKR conducts business
	with offices around the world, which provides a global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities. KKR operates as a single professional services
	firm and carries out its investment activities under the KKR brand name.




	        KKR & Co. L.P.
	was formed as a Delaware limited partnership on June 25, 2007 and its general partner is KKR Management LLC (the "Managing Partner").
	KKR & Co. L.P. is the parent company of KKR Group Limited, which is the non-economic general partner of KKR Group Holdings L.P. ("Group Holdings"), and
	KKR & Co. L.P. is the sole limited partner of Group Holdings. Group Holdings holds a controlling economic interest in each of (i) KKR Management Holdings L.P.
	("Management Holdings") through KKR Management Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation which is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (ii) KKR Fund
	Holdings L.P. ("Fund Holdings" and together
	with Management Holdings, the "KKR Group Partnerships") directly and through KKR Fund Holdings GP Limited, a Cayman Island limited company which is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes. Group Holdings also owns certain economic interests in Management Holdings through a wholly owned Delaware corporate subsidiary of KKR Management Holdings Corp. and certain economic
	interests in Fund Holdings through a Delaware partnership of which Group Holdings is the general partner with a 99% economic interest and KKR Management Holdings Corp. is a limited partner with a 1%
	economic interest. KKR & Co. L.P., through its indirect controlling economic interests in the KKR Group Partnerships, is the holding partnership for the KKR business.




	        KKR & Co. L.P.
	both indirectly controls the KKR Group Partnerships and indirectly holds equity units in each KKR Group Partnership (collectively, "KKR Group
	Partnership Units") representing economic interests in KKR's business. The remaining KKR Group Partnership Units are held by KKR's current and former principals through KKR Holdings L.P. ("KKR
	Holdings"), which is not a subsidiary of KKR. As of December 31, 2013, KKR & Co. L.P. held 41.6% of the KKR Group Partnership Units and KKR's principals held 58.4% of the
	KKR Group Partnership Units through KKR Holdings. The percentage ownership in the KKR Group Partnerships will continue to change as KKR Holdings and/or KKR's current and former principals exchange
	units in the KKR Group Partnerships for KKR & Co. L.P. common units.

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	Basis of Presentation





	        The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
	the United States of America ("GAAP").




	        The
	consolidated financial statements (referred to hereafter as the "financial statements") include the accounts of KKR's management and capital markets companies, the general partners
	of certain unconsolidated funds, general partners of consolidated funds and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities.




	        KKR
	consolidates the financial results of the KKR Group Partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries. KKR Holdings' ownership interest in the KKR Group Partnerships is reflected as
	noncontrolling interests in the accompanying financial statements.




	        References
	in the accompanying financial statements to KKR's "principals" are to KKR's senior current and former employees and non-employee operating consultants who hold interests in
	KKR's business through KKR Holdings, including those principals who also hold interests in the Managing Partner entitling those principals to vote for the election of the Managing Partners' directors
	(the "Senior Principals").





	Use of Estimates





	        The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment
	income (loss) during the reporting periods. Such estimates include but are not limited to the valuation of investments and financial instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and
	such differences could be material to the financial statements.

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)






	Consolidation







	General






	        KKR consolidates (i) those entities in which it holds a majority voting interest or has majority ownership and control over
	significant operating, financial and investing decisions of the entity, including the KKR funds and vehicles in which KKR, as general partner, is presumed to have control, or (ii) entities
	determined to be variable interest entities ("VIEs") for which KKR is considered the primary beneficiary.




	        With
	respect to KKR's consolidated funds and vehicles, KKR generally has operational discretion and control, and fund investors have no substantive rights to impact ongoing governance
	and operating activities of the fund, including the ability to remove the general partner, also known as kick-out rights. As a result, a fund should be consolidated unless KKR has a nominal level of
	equity at risk. To the extent that KKR commits a nominal amount of equity to a given fund and has no obligation to fund any future losses, the equity at risk to KKR is not considered substantive and
	the fund is typically considered a VIE as described below. In these cases, the fund investors are generally deemed to be the primary beneficiaries, and KKR does not consolidate the fund. In cases when
	KKR's equity at risk is deemed to be substantive, the fund is generally not considered to be a VIE and KKR generally consolidates the fund.




	        KKR's
	funds are consolidated by KKR notwithstanding the fact that KKR has only a minority economic interest in those funds. KKR's financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities,
	fees, expenses, investment income (loss) and cash flows of the consolidated KKR funds and vehicles on a gross basis, and the majority of the economic interests in those funds, which are held by fund
	investors, are attributed to noncontrolling interests in the accompanying financial statements. All of the management fees and certain other amounts earned by KKR from those funds are eliminated in
	consolidation. However, because the eliminated amounts are earned from, and funded by, noncontrolling interests, KKR's attributable share of the net income (loss) from those funds is increased by the
	amounts eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination in consolidation of such amounts has no effect on net income (loss) attributable to KKR or KKR partners' capital.




	        KKR's
	funds are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and therefore are not required to consolidate their investments, including investments in portfolio companies, even if
	majority-owned and controlled. Rather, the consolidated funds and vehicles reflect their investments at fair value as
	described below in "Fair Value Measurements". All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.






	Variable Interest Entities






	        KKR consolidates all VIEs in which it is considered the primary beneficiary. An enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary
	if it has a controlling financial interest under GAAP. A controlling financial interest is defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most
	significantly impact the entity's business and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the
	variable interest entity. The consolidation rules which were revised effective January 1, 2010, require an analysis to determine (a) whether an entity in which KKR has a variable
	interest is a VIE and (b) whether

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)






	(All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted)






	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	KKR's
	involvement, through the holding of equity interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests unrelated to the holding of equity interests, would
	give it a controlling financial interest under GAAP. Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment. Where KKR has an interest in an entity that has qualified for the deferral of the
	consolidation rules, the analysis is based on consolidation rules prior to January 1, 2010. These rules require an analysis to determine (a) whether an entity in which KKR has a variable
	interest is a VIE and (b) whether KKR's involvement, through the holding of equity interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests would be
	expected to absorb a majority of the variability of the entity. Under both guidelines, KKR determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time it becomes involved with a VIE and
	reconsiders that conclusion at each reporting date. In evaluating whether KKR is the primary beneficiary, KKR evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either directly by KKR or indirectly
	through related parties. The consolidation analysis can generally be performed qualitatively; however, if it is not readily apparent that KKR is not the primary beneficiary, a quantitative analysis
	may also be performed. Investments and redemptions (either by KKR, affiliates of KKR or third parties) or amendments to the governing documents of the respective entities could affect an entity's
	status as a VIE or the determination of the primary beneficiary. At each reporting date, KKR assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary and will consolidate or not consolidate accordingly. KKR's
	accounting conclusion under the existing consolidation rules determined that effective January 1, 2011, KKR became the primary beneficiary of certain entities and consolidated such entities
	that were unconsolidated prior to that date.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the maximum exposure to loss, before allocations to the carry pool, if any, for those VIEs in which KKR is determined not to be the primary
	beneficiary but in which it has a variable interest is as follows:

	        For
	those unconsolidated VIEs in which KKR is the sponsor, KKR may have an obligation as general partner to provide commitments to such funds. For the years ended December 31,
	2013, 2012 and 2011, KKR did not provide any support other than its obligated amount.




	        KKR's
	investment strategies differ by investment fund; however, the fundamental risks have similar characteristics, including loss of invested capital and loss of management fees and
	carried interests. Accordingly, disaggregation of KKR's involvement by type of VIE would not provide more useful information.





	Business Combinations





	        Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the
	assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)






	Intangible Assets





	        Intangible assets consist primarily of contractual rights to earn future fee income, including management and incentive fees, and are
	recorded in Other Assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. Identifiable finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
	useful lives and amortization expense is included within General, Administrative and Other in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when
	circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. KKR does not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets.





	Goodwill





	        Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection
	with an acquisition. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is recorded in Other Assets in the accompanying
	consolidated statements of financial condition.





	Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests





	        Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests represent noncontrolling interests of certain investment vehicles and funds that are subject to
	periodic redemption by fund investors following the expiration of a specified period of time (typically between one and three years), or may be withdrawn subject to a redemption fee during the period
	when capital may not be otherwise withdrawn. Fund investors interests subject to redemption as described above are presented as Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in the accompanying consolidated
	statements of financial condition and presented as Net Income (Loss) attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.




	        When
	redeemable amounts become legally payable to fund investors, they are classified as a liability and included in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the
	accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. For all consolidated investment vehicles and funds in which redemption rights have not been granted, noncontrolling interests are presented
	within Equity in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition as Noncontrolling Interests.





	Noncontrolling Interests





	        Noncontrolling interests represent (i) noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and (ii) noncontrolling
	interests held by KKR Holdings.






	Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Entities






	        Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the non-redeemable ownership interests in KKR that are held primarily
	by:

	Noncontrolling Interests held by KKR Holdings






	        Noncontrolling interests held by KKR Holdings include economic interests held by KKR's principals in the KKR Group Partnerships. KKR's
	principals receive financial benefits from KKR's business in the form of distributions received from KKR Holdings and through their direct and indirect participation in the value of KKR Group
	Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings. These financial benefits are not paid by KKR and are borne by KKR Holdings.

	        Net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. after allocation to noncontrolling interests held by KKR Holdings, with the exception of certain tax assets and
	liabilities that are directly allocable to KKR Management Holdings Corp., is attributed based on the percentage of the weighted average KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR and KKR Holdings, each
	of which hold equity of the KKR Group Partnerships. However, primarily because of the (i) contribution of certain expenses borne entirely by KKR Holdings, (ii) the periodic exchange of
	KKR Holdings units for KKR & Co. L.P. common units pursuant to the exchange agreement and (iii) the contribution of certain expenses borne entirely by KKR associated with

	Investments





	        Investments consist primarily of private equity, real assets, credit, equity method and other investments. Investments are carried at
	their estimated fair values, with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated
	statements of operations. Investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are valued based on the spot rate of the respective currency at the end of the reporting period with changes
	related to exchange rate movements reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. Security and loan transactions are recorded
	on a trade date basis. Further disclosure on investments is presented in Note 4, "Investments."

	Fair Value Measurements





	        Investments and other financial instruments are measured and carried at fair value. The majority of investments and other financial
	instruments are held by the consolidated funds and vehicles. KKR's funds are, for GAAP purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value. KKR
	has retained the specialized accounting for the consolidated funds and vehicles in consolidation. Accordingly, the unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the investments
	held by KKR's funds are reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations.




	        For
	investments and other financial instruments that are not held in a consolidated fund or vehicle, KKR has elected the fair value option since these investments and other financial
	instruments are similar to those in the consolidated funds and vehicles. Such election is irrevocable and is applied on an investment by investment basis at initial recognition. Unrealized gains and
	losses resulting from changes in fair value are reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. The methodology for measuring
	the fair value of such investments and other financial instruments is consistent with the methodologies applied to investments and other financial instruments that are held in consolidated funds and
	vehicles.




	        The
	carrying amounts of Other Assets, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities recognized on the statements of financial condition (excluding Fixed Assets, Goodwill,
	Intangible Assets, contingent consideration and certain debt obligations) approximate fair value due to their short term maturities. Further information on Fixed Assets is presented in Note 7,
	"Other Assets and Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities". Further information on Goodwill and Intangible Assets is presented in Note 14 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets."
	Further information on contingent consideration is presented in Note 13 "Acquisitions." KKR's debt obligations, except for KKR's 2020 and 2043 Senior Notes, bear interest at floating rates and
	therefore fair value approximates carrying value. Further information on KKR's 2020 and 2043 Senior Notes are presented in Note 8, "Debt Obligations." The fair value for KKR's 2020 and 2043
	Senior Notes were derived using Level II inputs similar to those utilized in valuing credit investments.




	        Fair
	value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where
	available, fair value is

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	based
	on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation techniques are applied. These valuation
	techniques involve varying levels of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on a variety of factors. See Note 5, "Fair Value Measurements" for further information
	on KKR's valuation techniques that involve unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the statements of financial condition are categorized based upon the level of judgment
	associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined under GAAP, are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to the valuation of
	these assets and liabilities. The hierarchical levels defined under GAAP are as follows:






	Level I






	        Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. The type of
	investments and other financial instruments included in this category are publicly-listed equities and debt and securities sold short.






	Level II






	        Inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level II
	inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. The type of investments and other financial
	instruments included in this category are credit investments, convertible debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives.






	Level III






	        Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset
	or liability. The types of assets and liabilities generally included in this category are private portfolio companies, real assets investments and credit investments for which a sufficiently liquid
	trading market does not exist.




	        In
	certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the
	fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. KKR's assessment of the significance
	of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset.




	        A
	significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because
	in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly. In those circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant
	adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value.




	        The
	availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument,
	whether the instrument has recently been issued, whether the instrument is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market, and current market conditions. To the extent that valuation is based
	on models or

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)






	(All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted)






	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	inputs
	that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by KKR in determining fair value is
	greatest for instruments categorized in Level III. The variability and availability of the observable inputs affected by the factors described above may cause transfers between Levels I,
	II, and III, which KKR recognizes at the beginning of the reporting period.




	        Investments
	and other financial instruments that have readily observable market prices (such as those traded on a securities exchange) are stated at the last quoted sales price as of the
	reporting date. KKR does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where KKR holds a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price.




	        Management's
	determination of fair value is based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate assumptions that are management's best estimates after
	consideration of a variety of internal and external factors.






	Level II Valuation Methodologies






	        Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level II consist primarily of securities indexed to publicly-listed securities
	and credit and other investments. Credit investments generally have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. Bid prices reflect the highest price that KKR and others are willing to
	pay for an asset. Ask prices represent the lowest price that KKR and others are willing to accept for an asset. For financial assets and liabilities whose inputs are based on bid-ask prices obtained
	from third party pricing services, fair value may not always be a predetermined point in the bid-ask range. KKR's policy is generally to allow for mid-market pricing and adjusting to the point within
	the bid-ask range that meets KKR's best estimate of fair value. For securities indexed to publicly listed securities, such as convertible debt, the securities are typically valued using standard
	convertible security pricing models. The key inputs into these models that require some amount of judgment are the credit spreads utilized and the volatility assumed. To the extent the company being
	valued has other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the implied credit spread on the company's other outstanding debt securities would be utilized in the valuation. To the
	extent the company being valued does not have other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the credit spread will be estimated based on the implied credit spreads observed in comparable
	publicly-traded debt securities. In certain cases, an additional spread will be added to reflect an illiquidity discount due to the fact that the security being valued is not publicly-traded. The
	volatility assumption is based upon the historically observed volatility of the underlying equity security into which the convertible debt security is convertible and/or the volatility implied by the
	prices of options on the underlying equity security.






	Level III Valuation Methodologies






	        Financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level III consist primarily of the following:





	        Private Equity Investments:



	    KKR generally employs two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity
	investment. The
	first methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures. The second methodology
	utilized is typically a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of
	capital for the investment and assumed inputs used




	195











	Table of Contents







	KKR & CO. L.P.






	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)






	(All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Unit, Per Unit Data, and Except Where Noted)






	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	to
	calculate terminal values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. Other inputs are also used in both methodologies.




	        Upon
	completion of the valuations conducted using these methodologies, a weighting is ascribed to each method, and an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate. The
	ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within a range suggested by the two methodologies.




	        When
	determining the weighting ascribed to each valuation methodology, KKR considers, among other factors, the availability of direct market comparables, the applicability of a
	discounted cash flow analysis and the expected hold period and manner of realization for the investment. These factors can result in different weightings among investments in the portfolio and in
	certain instances may result in up to a
	100% weighting to a single methodology. Across the Level III private equity investment portfolio, approximately 84.7% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly
	50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. Less than 5% of the fair value of the Level III private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are
	valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a discounted cash flow analysis.




	        When
	determining the illiquidity discount to be applied, KKR seeks to take a uniform approach across its portfolio and generally applies a minimum 5% discount to all private equity
	investments. KKR then evaluates such private equity investments to determine if factors exist that could make it more challenging to monetize the investment and, therefore, justify applying a higher
	illiquidity discount. These factors generally include (i) whether KKR is unable to sell the portfolio company or conduct an initial public offering of the portfolio company due to the consent
	rights of a third party or similar factors, (ii) whether the portfolio company is undergoing significant restructuring activity or similar factors and (iii) characteristics about the
	portfolio company regarding its size and/or whether the portfolio company is experiencing, or expected to experience, a significant decline in earnings. These factors generally make it less likely
	that a portfolio company would be sold or publicly offered in the near term at a price indicated by using just a market multiples and/or discounted cash flow analysis, and these factors tend to reduce
	the number of opportunities to sell an investment and/or increase the time horizon over which an investment may be monetized. Depending on the applicability of these factors, KKR determines the amount
	of any incremental illiquidity discount to be applied above the 5% minimum, and during the time KKR holds the investment, the illiquidity discount may be increased or decreased, from time to time,
	based on changes to these factors. The amount of illiquidity discount applied at any time requires considerable judgment about what a market participant would consider and is based on the facts and
	circumstances of each individual investment. Accordingly, the illiquidity discount ultimately considered by a market participant upon the realization of any investment may be higher or lower than that
	estimated by KKR in its valuations.





	        Real Assets Investments:



	    For energy and infrastructure investments, KKR generally utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis, which
	incorporates
	significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal
	values, such as exit EBITDA multiples. For real estate investments, KKR generally utilizes a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates
	significant assumptions and judgments. Estimates of key inputs used in these methodologies include an unlevered discount rate and terminal capitalization rate. The valuations

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	of
	real assets investments also use other inputs. Certain investments in real estate and energy generally do not include a minimum illiquidity discount.





	        Credit Investments:



	    Credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not
	available,
	credit investments are valued by KKR based on ranges of valuations determined by an independent valuation firm. Valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses, for which the key inputs
	are determined based on market comparables, which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers.





	        Other Investments:



	    KKR generally employs the same valuation methodologies as described above for private equity investments when
	valuing these other
	investments.




	        Key
	unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on KKR's Level III investment valuations as described above are included in Note 5 "Fair Value Measurements." KKR
	utilizes several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of its Level III investments. These unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by
	investment and in the application of KKR's valuation methodologies. KKR's reported fair value estimates could vary materially if KKR had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and
	other assumptions or, for applicable investments, if KKR only used either the discounted cash flow methodology or the market comparables methodology instead of assigning a weighting to both
	methodologies.






	Level III Valuation Process






	        The valuation process involved for Level III measurements for private equity, real assets, credit, and other investments is
	completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of Level III investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review. KKR has a Private Markets
	valuation committee for private equity and real assets investments and a valuation committee for credit and other investments. The Private Markets valuation committee may be assisted by subcommittees
	for example in the valuation of real estate investments. Each of the Private Markets valuation committee and the credit valuation committee is assisted by a valuation team, which, except as noted
	below, is comprised only of employees who are not investment professionals responsible for preparing preliminary valuations or for oversight of any of the investments being valued. The valuation teams
	for energy, infrastructure and real estate investments contain investment professionals who participate in the preparation of preliminary valuations and oversight for those investments. The valuation
	committees and teams are responsible for coordinating and consistently implementing KKR's quarterly valuation policies, guidelines and processes. For Private Markets investments classified as
	Level III, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable
	companies and other factors. These preliminary valuations are reviewed with the investment professionals by the applicable valuation team and are also reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged
	by KKR to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations for all Level III investments in Private Markets, except for certain investments other than KKR
	private equity investments. For most investments classified as Level III in Public markets, an
	independent valuation firm is generally engaged by KKR to provide third party valuations, or ranges of valuations from which KKR's investment professionals select a preliminary valuation, or a third
	party firm is generally engaged by KKR to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of KKR's valuations. All

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	preliminary
	valuations in Private Markets and Public Markets are then reviewed by the applicable valuation committee, and after reflecting any input by their respective valuation committees, the
	preliminary valuations are presented to the management committee. When these valuations are approved by this committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of Level III
	investments, as well as the valuations of Level I and Level II investments, are presented to the audit committee of KKR's board of directors and are then reported on to the board of
	directors.





	Derivatives





	        Derivative contracts include forward, swap and option contracts related to foreign currencies and credit standing of reference entities
	to manage foreign exchange risk and credit risk arising from certain assets and liabilities. All derivatives are recognized in Other Assets or Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities
	and are presented gross in the consolidated statements of financial condition and measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the
	accompanying consolidated statements of operations. KKR's derivative financial instruments contain credit risk to the extent that its counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements.
	KKR attempts to minimize this risk by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions with strong credit ratings.





	Securities Sold Short





	        Whether part of a hedging transaction or a transaction in its own right, securities sold short represent obligations of KKR to deliver
	the specified security at the contracted price at a future point in time, and thereby create a liability to repurchase the security in the market at the prevailing prices. The liability for such
	securities sold short, which is recorded in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the statement of financial condition, is marked to market based on the current fair value of the
	underlying security at the reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as unrealized gains or losses in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the accompanying consolidated statements
	of operations. These transactions may involve market risk in
	excess of the amount currently reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition.





	Cash and Cash Equivalents





	        KKR considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash
	equivalents.





	Cash and Cash Equivalents Held at Consolidated Entities





	        Cash and cash equivalents held at consolidated entities represents cash that, although not legally restricted, is not available to fund
	general liquidity needs of KKR as the use of such funds is generally limited to the investment activities of KKR's funds.

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)






	Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents





	        Restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily represent amounts that are held by third parties under certain of KKR's financing and
	derivative transactions.





	Due from and Due to Affiliates





	        For purposes of classifying amounts, KKR considers its principals and their related entities, unconsolidated funds and the portfolio
	companies of its funds to be affiliates. Receivables from and payables to affiliates are recorded at their current settlement amount.





	Fixed Assets, Depreciation and Amortization





	        Fixed assets consist primarily of leasehold improvements, furniture and computer hardware. Such amounts are recorded at cost less
	accumulated depreciation and amortization and are included in Other Assets within the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using
	the straight-line method over the assets'
	estimated economic useful lives, which for leasehold improvements are the lesser of the lease terms or the life of the asset, and three to seven years for other fixed assets.





	Comprehensive Income





	        Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and
	circumstances, excluding those resulting from contributions from and distributions to owners. In the accompanying consolidated financial statements, comprehensive income represents Net Income (Loss),
	as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and net foreign currency translation adjustments.





	Fees





	        Fees consist primarily of (i) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital
	markets activities, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, a specialty finance company, structured finance and other vehicles,
	and separately managed accounts, (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies, and (iv) consulting and other fees earned by consolidated entities from providing
	advisory and other services.

	        Substantially
	all fees presented in the table above are earned from affiliates.






	Transaction Fees






	        Transaction fees are earned by KKR primarily in connection with successful investment transactions and capital markets activities.
	Transaction fees are recognized upon closing of the transaction. Fees are typically paid on or around the closing of a transaction.




	        In
	connection with pursuing successful portfolio company investments, KKR receives reimbursement for certain transaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses, which are
	reimbursed by third parties, are typically deferred until the transaction is consummated and are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition on the date incurred.
	The costs of successfully completed transactions are borne by the KKR Funds and included as a component of the investment's cost basis. Subsequent to closing, investments are recorded at fair value
	each reporting period as described in the section above titled "Investments". Upon reimbursement from a third party, the cash receipt is recorded and the deferred amounts are relieved. No fees or
	expenses are recorded for these reimbursements.






	Management Fees






	        Management fees are earned by KKR for management services provided to private equity funds, a specialty finance company, structured
	finance vehicles and other investment vehicles which are recognized in the period during which the related services are performed in accordance with the contractual terms of the related agreement.
	Management fees earned from private equity funds and certain investment vehicles are based upon a percentage of capital committed during the investment period, and thereafter based on remaining
	invested capital. For certain other investment vehicles, structured finance vehicles, separately managed accounts and a specialty finance vehicle, management fees are recognized in the period during
	which the related services are performed and are based upon the net asset value, gross assets or as otherwise defined in the respective agreements.




	        Management
	fees received from KKR's consolidated funds and vehicles are eliminated in consolidation. However, because these amounts are funded by, and earned from, noncontrolling
	interests, KKR's allocated share of the net income from KKR's consolidated funds and vehicles is

	increased
	by the amount of fees that are eliminated. Accordingly, the elimination of these fees does not have an effect on the net income (loss) attributable to KKR or KKR partners' capital.





	Private Equity Funds





	        For KKR's consolidated and unconsolidated private equity funds, gross management fees generally range from 1% to 2% of committed
	capital during the fund's investment period and is generally 0.75% of invested capital after the expiration of the fund's investment period with subsequent reductions over time. Typically, an
	investment period is defined as a period of up to six years. The actual length of the investment period may be shorter based on the timing and deployment of committed capital.




	        Certain
	of KKR's private equity funds require the management company to refund up to 20% of any cash management fees earned from limited partners in the event that the funds recognize a
	carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned or a portion thereof, a liability to the fund's limited
	partners is
	recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the cash management fees earned. The refunds to the limited partners are paid, and the
	liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized. In the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover
	all or a portion of the amount that represents 20% of the earned cash management fees, these fees would not be returned to the funds' limited partners, in accordance with the respective fund
	agreements.





	KKR Financial Holdings LLC ("KFN")





	        KKR's management agreement with KFN entitles KKR to a base management fee computed and payable monthly in arrears, based on an annual
	rate of 1.75% of adjusted equity, which is an amount defined in the management agreement.





	Structured Finance Vehicles





	        KKR's management agreements for its structured finance vehicles provide for senior collateral management fees and subordinate
	collateral management fees. Senior collateral management fees are determined based on an annual rate ranging from 0.15% to 0.20% of collateral and subordinate collateral management fees are determined
	based on an annual rate ranging from 0.30% to 0.35% of collateral. If amounts distributable on any payment date are insufficient to pay the collateral management fees according to the priority of
	payments, any shortfall is deferred and payable on subsequent payment dates. KKR has the right to waive all or any portion of any collateral management fee. As of December 31, 2013, KKR has
	permanently waived $189.0 million of collateral management fees. KKR generally waives the collateral management fees for the majority of its structured finance vehicles; however, KKR may cease
	waiving collateral management fees at its discretion. For the purpose of calculating the collateral management fees, collateral, the payment dates, and the priority of payments are terms defined in
	the management agreements.

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)






	Other Investment Vehicles





	        Certain other investment vehicles that invest capital in credit and hedge fund strategies provide for management fees determined
	quarterly based on an annual rate generally ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%. Such rate may be based on the investment vehicles average net asset value, capital commitments, or invested capital.






	Monitoring Fees






	        Monitoring fees are earned by KKR for services provided to portfolio companies and are recognized as services are rendered. These fees
	are generally paid based on a fixed periodic schedule by the portfolio companies either in advance or in arrears and are separately negotiated for each portfolio company.




	        In
	connection with the monitoring of portfolio companies and certain unconsolidated funds, KKR receives reimbursement for certain expenses incurred on behalf of these entities. Costs
	incurred in monitoring these entities are classified as general, administrative and other expenses and reimbursements of such costs are classified as monitoring fees. In addition, certain monitoring
	fee provisions may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. These termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction
	closes.






	Consulting and Other Fees






	        Consulting and other fees are earned by certain consolidated entities from providing advisory and other services to portfolio companies
	and other companies and are recognized as the services are rendered. These fees are separately negotiated with each company for which services are provided.






	Incentive Fees








	KFN






	        KKR's management agreement with KFN entitles KKR to quarterly incentive fees. KKR records the KFN performance-based incentive fee, if
	any, when the performance-based incentive fee becomes fixed and determinable, which is quarterly. The quarterly incentive fee is an amount equal to the product of (i) 25% of the dollar amount
	by which: (a) KFN's net income, before incentive compensation, per weighted average share of KFN's common shares for such quarter, exceeds (b) an amount equal to (A) the weighted
	average of the price per share of the common stock of KFN in its August 2004 private placement and the prices per share of the common stock of KFN in its initial public offering and any subsequent
	offerings by KFN multiplied by (B) the greater of (1) 2.00% and (2) 0.50% plus one-fourth of the ten year treasury rate for such quarter, multiplied by (ii) the weighted
	average number of KFN's common shares outstanding in such quarter. The incentive fee is paid quarterly in arrears and is not subject to any hurdle or clawback provisions.






	Hedge Fund Structures






	        Incentive fees earned on the performance of certain hedge fund structures are recognized based on fund performance, subject to the
	achievement of minimum return levels, and/or high water marks, in

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	accordance
	with the respective terms set out in each fund's governing agreements. Incentive fee rates generally range from 5% to 20%. KKR does not record performance-based incentive fees until the end
	of each fund's measurement period (which is generally one year) when the performance-based incentive fees become fixed and determinable.





	Investment Income





	        Investment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments which are
	recorded in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities, (ii) dividends, (iii) interest income, (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating
	to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency options and foreign denominated debt which are recorded in net gains (losses) from investment activities. Unrealized
	gains or losses result from changes in fair value of investments during the period and are included in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities. Upon disposition of an investment, previously
	recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a realized gain or loss is recognized.






	Dividend Income






	        Dividend income is recognized by KKR on the ex-dividend date, or in the absence of a formal declaration, on the date it is received.
	For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the majority of dividends were earned by KKR's consolidated funds and vehicles.






	Interest Income






	        Interest income is recognized as earned. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the majority of interest income
	was earned by KKR's consolidated funds and vehicles.






	Interest Expense






	        Interest expense is incurred from debt issued by KKR, credit facilities entered into by KKR and debt outstanding at the KKR funds and
	vehicles entered into with the objective of enhancing returns or managing cash flow, which are not direct obligations of the general partners of the KKR funds or management companies. In addition to
	these interest costs, KKR capitalizes debt financing costs incurred in connection with new debt arrangements. Such costs are amortized into interest expense using either the interest method or the
	straight-line method, as appropriate.





	Compensation and Benefits





	        Compensation and Benefits expense includes cash compensation consisting of salaries, bonuses, and benefits, as well as equity based
	compensation consisting of charges associated with the vesting of equity-based awards and carry pool allocations.




	        All
	KKR principals and other employees of certain consolidated entities receive a base salary that is paid by KKR or its consolidated entities, and is accounted for as Compensation and
	Benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations. These employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance, overall profitability and other matters.
	While cash bonuses paid to most employees are borne by KKR and certain consolidated entities and result in customary

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	compensation
	and benefits expense, cash bonuses that are paid to certain of KKR's principals are currently borne by KKR Holdings. These bonuses are funded with distributions that KKR Holdings receives
	on KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings but are not then passed on to holders of unvested units of KKR Holdings. Because KKR principals are not entitled to receive distributions on units
	that are unvested, any amounts allocated to principals in excess of a principal's vested equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense. These compensation charges are
	recorded based on the unvested portion of quarterly earnings distributions received by KKR Holdings at the time of the distribution.




	        Further
	disclosure regarding equity based compensation is presented in Note 10 "Equity Based Compensation."





	Profit Sharing Plan





	        KKR provides certain profit sharing programs for KKR employees and other eligible personnel. In particular, KKR provides a 401(k) plan
	(the "Plan") for eligible employees in the United States. For certain professionals who are participants in the Plan, KKR may, in its discretion, contribute an amount after the end of the Plan year.
	For the years ended December 31,
	2013, 2012 and 2011, KKR incurred expenses of $7.7 million, $6.5 million and $6.0 million, respectively, in connection with the Plan.





	Carry Pool Allocation





	        With respect to KKR's active and future funds and co-investment vehicles that provide for carried interest, KKR allocates to its
	principals and other professionals a portion of the carried interest earned in relation to these funds as part of its carry pool. KKR currently allocates approximately 40% of the carry it earns from
	these funds and vehicles to its carry pool. These amounts are accounted for as compensatory profit-sharing arrangements in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities within the
	accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition in conjunction with the related carried interest income and recorded as compensation expense for KKR employees and general, administrative
	and other expense for certain non-employee consultants and service providers in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 12 "Segment Reporting" for the amount of carry pool
	allocation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.





	Carried Interest





	        Carried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative
	to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduces noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included
	as investment income (loss) in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations and are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that
	cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized
	carried interest will be reversed and reflected as investment losses in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations. Carried interest is recognized based
	on the contractual formula set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund was terminated at the reporting date with the then estimated fair values of the

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	investments
	realized. Due to the extended durations of KKR's private equity funds and other investment vehicles, KKR believes that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects the
	periodic performance of KKR in the management of those funds. For funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is
	allocable to KKR's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The carried interest that KKR retains in net income (loss) attributable to
	KKR & Co. L.P. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. See Note 12 "Segment Reporting" for the amount of carried
	interest income earned or reversed for years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.




	        The
	agreements governing KKR's private equity funds generally include a "clawback" or, in certain instances, a "net loss sharing" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a
	contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return or contribute amounts to the fund for distribution to fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. See Note 15
	"Commitments and Contingencies".





	General, Administrative and Other





	        General, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and
	consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges and costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential
	investments that do not result in completed transactions.





	Foreign Currency





	        Consolidated entities which have a functional currency that differs from KKR's reporting currency are primarily KKR's management and
	capital markets companies located outside the United States. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period.
	Results of foreign operations are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for each reporting period. Translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
	income (loss) until realized. Foreign currency income or expenses resulting from transactions outside of the functional currency of a consolidated entity are recorded as incurred in general,
	administrative and other expense in the consolidated statements of operations.





	Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. Per Common Unit





	        Basic Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit is calculated by dividing Net Income (Loss)
	attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. by the weighted average number of common units outstanding during the period.




	        Diluted
	Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit is calculated by dividing Net Income (Loss) attributable to
	KKR & Co. L.P. by the weighted average number of common units outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional common units that would have been
	outstanding if dilutive potential common units had been issued.




	        Diluted
	Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit excludes KKR Holdings units which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common units
	of KKR & Co. L.P. The KKR Holdings units are excluded from the diluted calculation since the exchange of these units

	would
	proportionally increase KKR & Co. L.P.'s interests in the KKR Group Partnerships and would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common unit as a result of certain
	tax benefits KKR & Co. L.P. is assumed to receive upon the exchange.




	        Diluted
	Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit include unvested equity awards that have been granted under the
	KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan ("Equity Incentive Plan") since these equity awards dilute KKR and KKR Holdings pro rata in accordance with their respective percentage
	interests in the KKR Group Partnerships.




	        Further
	disclosure regarding Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit is presented in Note 6 "Net Income (Loss) Attributable to
	KKR & Co. L.P. Per Common Unit."





	Income Taxes





	        The consolidated entities of KKR are generally treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for U.S. and non-U.S. tax purposes.
	However, certain consolidated subsidiaries are treated as corporations for U.S. and non-U.S tax purposes and are therefore subject to U.S. federal, state and/or local income taxes at the entity-level.
	In addition, certain consolidated entities which are treated as partnerships for U.S. tax purposes are subject to the New York City Unincorporated Business Tax or other local taxes.




	        Income
	taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
	consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
	reverse. The effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets, which are recorded in Other
	Assets within the statement of financial condition, are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.




	        For
	a particular tax-paying component of an entity and within a particular tax jurisdiction, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset and presented as a single amount within Other
	Assets or Accounts Payable, Accrued and Other Liabilities, as applicable, in the accompanying statements of financial position.




	        KKR
	analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax
	years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, KKR determines that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a reserve is established. KKR recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to
	uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.




	        KKR
	records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process: (a) determination is made whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based
	on the technical merits of the position and (b) those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
	50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)






	Tax Receivable Agreement





	        KKR and certain intermediate holding companies that are taxable corporations for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, may
	be required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant to the exchange agreement with KKR Holdings. KKR Management Holdings L.P. made an election under Section 754
	of the Internal Revenue Code that will remain in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units for common units occurs, which may result in an increase in KKR's
	intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the assets of the KKR Group Partnerships at the time of an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units. Certain of these exchanges are expected to
	result in an increase in KKR's intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the
	goodwill inherent in KKR's business that would not otherwise have been available. This increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce
	the amount of income tax KKR's intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future. This increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future
	dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.




	        KKR
	has entered into a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings, which requires KKR's intermediate holding companies to pay to KKR Holdings, or to executives who have exchanged KKR
	Holdings units for KKR common units (as transferees of KKR Group Partnership Units), 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate
	holding companies realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of increases
	in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. A termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that KKR would be
	deemed to realize in connection with such events. In the event that other of KKR's current or future subsidiaries become
	taxable as corporations and acquire KKR Group Partnership Units in the future, or if KKR becomes taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, KKR expects that each will become
	subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms.




	        These
	payment obligations are obligations of KKR's intermediate holding companies and not the KKR Group Partnerships and are recorded within Due to Affiliates in the accompanying
	consolidated statements of financial condition. As such, cash payments received by common unitholders may vary from those received by current and former holders of KKR Group Partnership Units held by
	KKR Holdings and KKR's current and former principals to the extent payments are made to those parties under the tax receivable agreement. Payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required
	to be made within 90 days of the filing of the tax returns of KKR's intermediate holding companies which may result in a timing difference between the tax savings received by KKR's intermediate
	holdings companies and the cash payments made to the selling holders of KKR Group Partnership Units.




	        For
	the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, cash payments that have been made under the tax receivable agreement were $4.7 million, $2.7 million and
	$0.2 million, respectively. KKR expects its intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. As of December 31,
	2013, $1.3 million of cumulative income tax savings have been realized.

	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)






	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements







	Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities






	        In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-11, "Disclosures about
	Offsetting Assets and Liabilities" ("ASU 2011-11"), which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments. In
	February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, which clarifies which instruments and transactions are subject to the offsetting disclosure requirements established by ASU 2011-11. ASU 2011-11 was
	effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning
	January 1, 2013 and was applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on KKR's financial statements.






	Goodwill Impairment Testing






	        In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, "IntangiblesGoodwill and Other," which provides the option to perform a
	qualitative, rather than quantitative, assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the asset is considered impaired, an entity is
	required to perform the quantitative assessment under the existing guidance. The guidance was effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance, which is
	intended to simplify the impairment testing, did not have a material impact on KKR's financial statements.






	Disclosures About Reclassification Adjustments Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income






	        In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, "Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
	("AOCI")," which requires entities to disclose additional information about reclassification adjustments, including: (i) changes in AOCI balances by component and (ii) significant items
	reclassified out of AOCI. ASU 2013-02 was effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2013. The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, did not have a material
	impact on KKR's financial statements. With respect to KKR, AOCI is comprised of only one component, foreign currency translation adjustments and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and
	2011, there were no items reclassified out of AOCI. See KKR's consolidated statements of comprehensive income and changes in equity.






	Foreign Currency Matters






	        In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, "Foreign Currency Matters," which indicates that the entire amount of a cumulative
	translation adjustment ("CTA") related to an entity's investment in a foreign entity should be released when there has been a (i) sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign
	entity and the sale represents the substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity, (ii) loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign
	entity, or (iii) step acquisition for a foreign entity. This guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2014, and is to be applied prospectively. The adoption of
	this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on KKR's financial statements.

	Amendments to Investment Company Scope, Measurement, and Disclosures






	        In June 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-08, Financial ServicesInvestment Companies Topic 946 ("ASU 2013-08") which amends
	the scope, measurement, and disclosure requirements for investment companies. ASU 2013-08 (i) amends the criteria for an entity to qualify as an investment company, (ii) requires an
	investment company to measure noncontrolling ownership interests in other investment companies at fair value rather than using the equity method of accounting, and (iii) introduces new
	disclosures. This guidance is effective for KKR's fiscal year beginning January 1, 2014. Earlier application is prohibited. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material
	impact on KKR's financial results and consolidated financial statements.





	3. NET GAINS (LOSSES) FROM INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES





	        Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations consist primarily of the realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments (including
	foreign exchange gains and losses attributable to foreign denominated investments and related activities) and other financial instruments, including those for which the fair value option has been
	elected. Unrealized gains or losses result from changes in the fair value of these investments and other financial instruments during a period. Upon disposition of an investment or financial
	instrument, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period.

	        In
	the table above, other investments represents private equity investments in the following industries: Education, Financial Services, Forestry, Media, Services, Telecommunications,
	Transportation and Recycling. None of these industries represents more than 10% of total private equity investments as of December 31, 2013.




	        The
	majority of the securities underlying private equity investments represent equity securities. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of investments that were other
	than equity securities amounted to $548.5 million and $364.5 million, respectively.





	Equity Method





	        Equity method investments include (i) certain investments in private equity funds, real assets funds, funds of hedge funds, and
	alternative credit funds, which are not consolidated, and (ii) certain investments in operating companies in which KKR is deemed to exert significant influence. Under the equity method of
	accounting, KKR's share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations.
	Because the underlying investments of unconsolidated investment funds are reported at fair value, the carrying value of these equity method investments representing KKR's interests in unconsolidated
	funds approximates fair value. The carrying value of equity method investments in certain operating companies, which KKR is determined to exert significant influence, is determined based on the
	amounts invested by KKR, adjusted for the equity in earnings or losses of the investee allocated based on KKR's respective ownership percentage, less
	distributions. See Note 3 "Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities" for the net changes in fair value associated with these investments.

	4. INVESTMENTS (Continued)





	        KKR evaluates each of its equity method investments to determine if any were significant as defined by the guidance from the SEC. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012,
	KKR's equity method investments did not meet the significance criteria either on an individual or group basis. As such, presentation of separate financial statements for any of KKR's equity method
	investments or summarized financial information on an individual or group basis is not required.





	5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS





	        The following tables summarize the valuation of KKR's investments and other financial instruments measured and reported at fair value by the fair value hierarchy levels described in
	Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 including those investments and other financial instruments for which the fair value option has been
	elected. Equity Method Investments have been excluded from the tables below.

	        In
	2012, $200.8 million of equity method investments which represented investments in unconsolidated investment vehicles were classified in Private Equity and Other investments in
	the table above. Because the underlying investments of unconsolidated investment vehicles are reported at fair value, the carrying value of the equity method investments approximated fair value. In
	2013, with the addition of equity method investments which do not approximate fair value, total equity method investments of $546.4 million and $200.8 million as of December 31,
	2013 and 2012, respectively, have been excluded from the tables above.

	The
	Transfers In noted in the tables above for credit and other investments are principally attributable to certain investments that experienced an
	insignificant level of market activity during the period and thus were valued in the absence of observable inputs.






	(2)




	The
	Transfers Out noted in the tables above for private equity investments are attributable to portfolio companies that are now valued using their publicly
	traded market price. The Transfers Out noted above for credit and other investments are principally attributable to certain investments that experienced a higher level of market activity during the
	period and thus were valued using observable inputs.






	        Total
	realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded for Level III investments are reported in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the accompanying consolidated
	statements of operations. There were no transfers between Level I and Level II during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

	In the table above, other investments, within private equity investments, represents the following
	industries: Education, Forestry, Media, Services, Telecommunications, Transportation, Manufacturing and Recycling. None of these industries represents more than 10% of total Level III private
	equity investments as of December 31, 2013.





	(1)




	In
	determining certain of these inputs, management evaluates a variety of factors including economic conditions, industry and market developments, market
	valuations of comparable companies and company specific developments including exit strategies and realization opportunities. Management has determined that market participants would take these inputs
	into account when valuing the investments. LTM means Last Twelve Months and EBITDA means Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization.






	(2)




	Inputs
	were weighted based on the fair value of the investments included in the range.






	(3)




	Unless
	otherwise noted, this column represents the directional change in the fair value of the Level III investments that would result from an
	increase to the corresponding unobservable input. A decrease to the unobservable input would have the opposite effect. Significant increases and decreases in these inputs in isolation could result in
	significantly higher or lower fair value measurements.






	(4)




	The
	directional change from an increase in the weight ascribed to the market comparables approach would increase the fair value of the Level III
	investments if the market comparables approach results in a higher valuation than the discounted cash flow approach. The opposite would be true if the market comparables approach results in a lower
	valuation than the discounted cash flow approach.






	(5)




	The
	directional change from an increase in the weight ascribed to the discounted cash flow approach would increase the fair value of the Level III
	investments if the discounted cash flow approach results in a higher valuation than the market comparables approach. The opposite would be true if the discounted cash flow approach results in a lower
	valuation than the market comparables approach.






	(6)




	Ranges
	shown exclude inputs relating to a single portfolio company that was determined to lack comparability with other investments in KKR's private equity
	portfolio. This portfolio company had a fair value representing less than 0.5% of the total fair value of Private Equity Investments and had an Enterprise Value/LTM EBITDA Multiple and Enterprise
	Value/Forward EBITDA Multiple of 24.7x and 18.2x, respectively. The exclusion of this investment does not impact the weighted average.






	(7)




	Level III
	private equity investments whose valuations include a control premium represent less than 5% of total Level III private equity
	investments. The valuations for the remaining investments do not include a control premium.






	(8)




	Amounts
	include $24.1 million of investments that were valued using dealer quotes or third party valuation firms.






	(9)




	The
	directional change from an increase in the weight ascribed to the direct income capitalization approach would increase the fair value of the
	Level III investments if the direct income capitalization approach results in a higher valuation than the discounted cash flow approach. The opposite would be true if the direct income
	capitalization approach results in a lower valuation than the discounted cash flow approach.






	        In
	the table above, certain private equity investments may be valued at cost for a period of time after an acquisition as the best indicator of fair value. In addition, certain
	valuations of private equity investments may be entirely or partially derived by reference to observable valuation measures for a pending or consummated transaction.




	        The
	table above excludes Other Investments in the amount of $348.5 million comprised primarily of privately-held equity and equity-like securities (e.g. warrants) in
	companies that are neither private equity, real assets nor credit investments. These investments were valued using Level III valuation methodologies that are generally the same as those shown
	for private equity investments.




	        The
	various unobservable inputs used to determine the Level III valuations may have similar or diverging impacts on valuation. Significant increases and decreases in these inputs
	in isolation and interrelationships between those inputs could result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements as noted in the table above.

	        For
	the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, KKR Holdings units have been excluded from the calculation of diluted Net Income (Loss) attributable to
	KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit since the
	exchange of these units would proportionally increase KKR & Co. L.P.'s interests in the KKR Group Partnerships and would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common unit
	as a result of certain tax benefits KKR & Co. L.P. is assumed to receive upon the exchange.




	        Diluted
	Net Income (Loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. per common unit includes unvested equity awards that have been granted under the Equity Incentive Plan since
	these equity awards dilute KKR and KKR Holdings pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests in the KKR Group Partnerships.

	2020 Senior Notes





	        On September 29, 2010, KKR Group Finance Co. LLC, a subsidiary of KKR Management Holdings Corp., issued
	$500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes (the "2020 Senior Notes"), which were issued at a price of 99.584%. The 2020 Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated
	obligations of KKR Group Finance Co. LLC and will mature on September 29, 2020, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. The 2020 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally
	guaranteed, jointly and severally, by KKR & Co. L.P. and the KKR Group Partnerships. The guarantees are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the guarantors.




	        The
	2020 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per annum, accruing from September 29, 2010. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 29 and
	September 29 of each year.




	        The
	indenture, as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture, relating to the 2020 Senior Notes includes covenants, including limitations on KKR Group Finance Co. LLC

	the outstanding 2020 Senior Notes may declare the 2020 Senior Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default after expiration of any
	applicable grace period. In the case of specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization, the principal amount of the 2020 Senior Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest on
	the 2020 Senior Notes automatically becomes due and payable. All or a portion of the 2020 Senior Notes may be redeemed at the issuer's option in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time,
	prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the 2020 Senior Notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the 2020 Senior Notes are subject to repurchase
	by the issuer at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Senior Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the 2020 Senior Notes
	repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase.

	Revolving Credit Facilities







	Corporate Credit Agreement






	        On February 26, 2008, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. entered into a credit agreement with a major
	financial institution (the "Corporate Credit Agreement"). The Corporate Credit Agreement originally provided for revolving borrowings of up to $1.0 billion, with a $50.0 million sublimit
	for swing-line notes and a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit.




	        On
	February 22, 2011, the parties amended the terms of the Corporate Credit Agreement such that effective March 1, 2011, availability for borrowings under the credit
	facility was reduced from $1.0 billion to $700.0 million and the maturity was extended to March 1, 2016. In addition, the KKR Group Partnerships became co-borrowers of the
	facility, and KKR & Co. L.P. and the issuer of the 2020 Senior Notes became guarantors of the amended and restated Corporate Credit Agreement, together with certain general
	partners of KKR's private equity funds.




	        On
	June 3, 2011, the Corporate Credit Agreement was amended to admit a new lender, subject to the same terms and conditions, to provide a commitment of $50.0 million. This
	commitment has increased the availability for borrowings under the credit facility to $750.0 million.




	        On
	June 22, 2012, KKR requested the issuance of a letter of credit in the amount of $14.5 million under the Corporate Credit Agreement in connection with a fee-generating
	transaction. The beneficiary of this letter of credit is an unaffiliated third party. The letter of credit was issued on July 2, 2012 and was initially set to expire on July 3, 2013. On
	August 20, 2012, the letter of credit in connection with this transaction was increased to $20.0 million and the expiration date was extended to August 1, 2013. On July 23,
	2013, the expiration date was extended to August 1, 2014. A $5.0 million sublimit for letters of credit remains available under the Corporate Credit Agreement.

	8. DEBT OBLIGATIONS (Continued)





	        As
	of December 31, 2013 and 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under the Corporate Credit Agreement, except for the letter of credit as described above. For the year ended
	December 31, 2013 and 2012, no amounts were drawn under the credit facility, except for the letter of credit as described above.






	KCM Credit Agreement






	        On February 27, 2008, KKR Capital Markets entered into a revolving credit agreement with a major financial institution (the "KCM
	Credit Agreement") for use in KKR's capital markets business. The KCM Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for revolving borrowings of up to $500 million with a $500 million sublimit
	for letters of credit.




	        On
	March 30, 2012, an agreement was made to extend the maturity of the KCM Credit Agreement from February 27, 2013 to March 30, 2017. In addition to extending the
	term, certain other terms of the KCM Credit Agreement were renegotiated including a reduction of the cost of funding on amounts drawn and a reduced commitment fee. Borrowings under this facility may
	only be used for KKR's capital markets business.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013 and 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under the KCM Credit Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, no amounts were drawn under
	the credit facility.





	Investment Financing Facilities





	        Certain of KKR's investment vehicles have entered into financing arrangements with major financial institutions, generally in
	connection with specific investments with the objective of enhancing returns or to provide liquidity to such vehicles. These financing arrangements are generally not direct obligations of the general
	partners of KKR's investment funds or its management companies. Such borrowings have varying maturities and bear interest at floating rates. Borrowings are generally secured by the investment
	purchased with the proceeds of the borrowing and/or the uncalled capital commitment of each respective fund. When an investment vehicle borrows, the proceeds are available only for use by that
	investment vehicle and are not available for the benefit of other investment vehicles or KKR. Collateral within each investment vehicle is also available only against borrowings by that investment
	vehicle and not against the borrowings of other investment vehicles or KKR. The weighted average interest rate of the investment financing facilities is 3.09% as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.
	In addition, the weighted average years to maturity are 2.3 years and 3.2 years as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

	principal payments for debt obligations at December 31, 2013 are as follows:

	(a)




	In
	connection with exchanges of KKR Holdings units into common units of KKR, KKR recorded a deferred tax asset associated with an increase in KKR Management
	Holdings Corp.'s share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of KKR Management Holdings L.P. This amount was offset by an adjustment to record amounts Due to KKR Holdings and
	executives under the tax receivable agreement, which is included within Due to Affiliates in the statements of financial condition. The net of these adjustments was recorded as an adjustment to equity
	at the time of the exchanges.






	        Future
	realization of the above deferred tax assets is dependent on KKR generating sufficient taxable income within the period of time that the tax benefits are expected to reverse. KKR
	considers projections of taxable income in evaluating its ability to utilize those deferred tax assets. In projecting its taxable income, KKR begins with historical results and incorporates
	assumptions concerning the amount and timing of future pretax operating income. Those assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that KKR uses to manage
	its business. At this time, KKR's projection of future taxable income indicates that it is more likely than not that the benefits from the deferred tax assets will be realized. Therefore, KKR has
	determined that no valuation allowance is needed at December 31, 2013. In addition, because KKR has not recorded an operating loss since its inception, KKR has not recorded a deferred tax asset
	for any federal or state net operating tax loss carry forwards.




	        KKR
	files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, KKR is subject to examination by federal and certain
	state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of December 31, 2013, the federal, state and local tax returns of KKR and its predecessor entities for the years 2010 through 2012 are open under
	normal statute of limitations and are therefore subject to examination.

	        If
	the above tax benefits were recognized it would reduce the annual effective income tax rate. KKR believes that there will not be a significant increase or decrease to the tax
	positions within 12 months of the reporting date.




	        The
	unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities. KKR recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax
	positions in income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, interest and penalties included in KKR's tax provision were immaterial.

	KKR Holdings Equity AwardsPrincipal Awards






	        KKR principals and certain non-employee consultants and service providers received grants of KKR Holdings units ("Principal Awards")
	which are exchangeable for KKR Group Partnership Units. These units are generally subject to minimum retained ownership requirements and in certain cases, transfer restrictions, and allow for their
	exchange into common units of KKR & Co. L.P. on a one-for-one basis. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, KKR Holdings owned approximately 58.4%, or 404,369,018 and 63.1% or
	432,553,276, respectively, of the outstanding KKR Group Partnership Units.




	        Except
	for any Principal Awards that vested on the date of grant, Principal Awards are subject to service based vesting, generally over a three to five year period from the date of
	grant. The transfer restriction period will generally last for a minimum of (i) one year with respect to one-half of the interests vesting on any vesting date and (ii) two years with
	respect to the other one-half of the interests vesting on such vesting date. While providing services to KKR, these individuals may also be

	subject
	to minimum retained ownership rules requiring them to continuously hold 25% of their vested interests. Upon separation from KKR, certain individuals will be subject to the terms of a
	non-compete agreement that may require the forfeiture of certain vested and unvested units should the terms of the
	non-compete agreement be violated. Holders of KKR Group Partnership Units held through KKR Holdings are not entitled to participate in distributions made on KKR Group Partnership Units until such
	units are vested.




	        Because
	KKR Holdings is a partnership, all of the 404,369,018 KKR Holdings units have been legally allocated, but the allocation of 32,318,948 of these units has not been communicated to
	each respective principal. The units that have not been communicated are subject to performance based vesting conditions, which include profitability and other similar criteria. These criteria are not
	sufficiently specific to constitute performance conditions for accounting purposes, and the achievement, or lack thereof, will be determined based upon the exercise of judgment by the general partner
	of KKR Holdings. Each principal will ultimately receive between zero and 100% of the units initially allocated. The allocation of these units has not yet been communicated to the award recipients as
	this was management's decision on how to best incentivize its principals. It is anticipated that additional service-based vesting conditions will be imposed at the time the allocation is initially
	communicated to the respective principals. KKR applied the guidance of Accounting Standards Code ("ASC") 718 and concluded that these KKR Holdings units do not yet meet the criteria for recognition of
	compensation cost because neither the grant date nor the service inception date has occurred. In reaching a conclusion that the service inception date has not occurred, KKR considered (a) the
	fact that the vesting conditions are not sufficiently specific to constitute performance conditions for accounting purposes, (b) the significant judgment that can be exercised by the general
	partner of KKR Holdings in determining whether the vesting conditions are ultimately achieved, and (c) the absence of communication to the principals of any information related to the number of
	units they were initially allocated. The allocation of these units will be communicated to the award recipients when the performance-based vesting conditions have been met, and currently there is no
	plan as to when the communication will occur. The determination as to whether the award recipients have satisfied the performance-based vesting conditions is made by the general partner of KKR
	Holdings, and is based on multiple factors primarily related to the award recipients' individual performance.




	        The
	fair value of Principal Awards is based on the closing price of KKR & Co. L.P. common units on the date of grant. KKR determined this to be the best evidence of
	fair value as a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit is traded in an active market and has an observable market price. Additionally, a KKR Holdings unit is an instrument with terms and
	conditions similar to those of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit. Specifically, units in both KKR Holdings and KKR & Co. L.P. represent ownership interests in KKR
	Group Partnership Units and, subject to any vesting, minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions referenced above, each KKR Holdings unit is exchangeable into a KKR Group
	Partnership Unit and then into a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit on a one-for-one basis.




	        Principal
	Awards give rise to equity-based payment charges in the consolidated statements of operations based on the grant-date fair value of the award. For units vesting on the grant
	date, expense is recognized on the date of grant based on the fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit on the grant date multiplied by the number of vested units. Equity-based
	payment expense on unvested units is calculated based on the fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit at the time of grant, discounted for the lack of participation rights in
	the expected distributions on unvested units which currently ranges from 7% to 52%, multiplied by the number of unvested units on the grant date. The grant date

	fair
	value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit reflects a discount for lack of distribution participation rights because equity awards are not entitled to receive distributions while
	unvested. The discount range was based on management's estimates of future distributions that unvested equity awards will not be entitled to receive between the grant date and the vesting date.
	Therefore, units that vest in the earlier periods have a lower discount as compared to units that vest in later periods, which have a higher discount. The discount range will generally increase when
	the level of expected annual distributions increases relative to the grant date fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit. A decrease in expected annual distributions relative to
	the grant date fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit would generally have the opposite effect.




	        Principal
	Awards granted to certain non-employee consultants and service providers give rise to general, administrative and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations.
	For units vesting on the grant date, expense is recognized on the date of grant based on the fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit on the grant date multiplied by the number
	of vested units. General, administrative and other expense recognized on unvested units is calculated based on the fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit on each reporting
	date and subsequently adjusted for the actual fair value of the award at each vesting date. Accordingly, the measured value of these units will not be finalized until each vesting date.




	        The
	calculation of equity-based payment expense and general administrative and other expense on unvested Principal Awards assumes forfeiture rates of up to 6% annually based upon
	expected turnover by class of principal, consultant, or service provider.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013, there was approximately $50.3 million of estimated unrecognized equity-based payment and general administrative and other expense related to
	unvested Principal Awards. That cost is expected to be recognized as follows:

	KKR Holdings Equity AwardsRestricted Equity Units






	        Grants of restricted equity units based on KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings were made to professionals, support staff,
	and other personnel ("Holdings REU Awards"). These grants will be funded by KKR Holdings and will not dilute KKR's interests in the KKR Group Partnerships. The vesting of these Holdings REU Awards
	occur in installments, generally over a three to five year period from the date of grant. Holdings REU Awards are measured and recognized on a basis similar to Principal Awards except that the fair
	value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit at the time of grant is not discounted for the lack of distribution participation rights since unvested units are entitled to distributions.
	The calculation assumes a forfeiture rate of up to 6% annually based upon expected turnover by class of professionals, support staff, and other personnel.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013, there was approximately $1.3 million of estimated unrecognized expense related to unvested awards. That cost is expected to be recognized as

	KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan






	        Under the Equity Incentive Plan, KKR is permitted to grant equity awards representing ownership interests in
	KKR & Co. L.P. common units. Vested awards under the Equity Incentive Plan dilute KKR & Co. L.P. common unitholders and KKR Holdings pro rata in accordance
	with their respective percentage interests in the KKR Group Partnerships.




	        The
	total number of common units that may be issued under the Equity Incentive Plan is equivalent to 15% of the number of fully diluted and exchanged common units outstanding, subject to
	annual adjustment. As of December 31, 2013, equity awards relating to 34,974,758 KKR & Co. L.P. common units have been granted under the Equity Incentive Plan and are
	subject to service based vesting, which vest generally over a three to five year period from the date of grant. In certain cases, these awards are subject to transfer restrictions and/or minimum
	retained ownership requirements. The transfer restriction period, if applicable, lasts for (i) one year with respect to one-half of the interests vesting on any vesting date and (ii) two
	years with respect to the other one-half of the interests vesting on such vesting date. While providing services to KKR, if applicable, certain of these recipients are also subject to minimum retained
	ownership rules requiring them to continuously hold common unit equivalents equal to at least 15% of their cumulatively vested interests.




	        Expense
	associated with the vesting of these awards is based on the closing price of the KKR & Co. L.P. common units on the date of grant, discounted for the lack of
	participation rights in

	the
	expected distributions on unvested units, which currently ranges from 7% to 52% multiplied by the number of unvested units on the grant date. The grant date fair value of a
	KKR & Co. L.P. common unit reflects a discount for lack of distribution participation rights because equity awards are not entitled to receive distributions while unvested. The
	discount range was based on management's estimates of future distributions that unvested equity awards will not be entitled to receive between the grant date and the vesting date. Therefore, units
	that vest in earlier periods have a lower discount as compared to units that vest in later periods, which have a higher discount. The discount range will generally increase when the level of expected
	annual distributions increases relative to the grant date fair value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit. A decrease in expected annual distributions relative to the grant date fair
	value of a KKR & Co. L.P. common unit would generally have the opposite effect. Expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the award and assumes a forfeiture
	rate of up to 6% annually based upon expected turnover by class of recipient.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013, there was approximately $173.1 million of estimated unrecognized expense related to unvested awards. That cost is expected to be recognized as

	Discretionary Compensation






	        All KKR principals and other employees of certain consolidated entities are eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses. While cash
	bonuses paid to most employees are borne by KKR and certain consolidated entities and result in customary compensation and benefits expense, cash bonuses that are paid to certain of KKR's principals
	are currently borne by KKR Holdings. These bonuses are funded with distributions that KKR Holdings receives on KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings but are not then passed on to holders of
	unvested units of KKR Holdings. Because KKR principals are not entitled to receive distributions on units that are unvested, any amounts allocated to principals in excess of a principal's vested
	equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense. These compensation charges are recorded based on the unvested portion of quarterly earnings distributions received by KKR
	Holdings at the time of the distribution.

	KFN






	        KFN is a publicly traded specialty finance company whose limited liability company interests are listed on the NYSE under the symbol
	"KFN." KFN is managed by KKR but is not consolidated by KKR. KFN was organized in August 2004 and completed its initial public offering on June 24, 2005. As of December 31, 2013 and
	2012, KFN had consolidated assets of $8.7 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, and shareholders' equity of $2.5 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Shares of KFN
	held by KKR represented less than 1.0% of KFN's outstanding shares as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. If KKR were to exercise all of its outstanding vested options, KKR's ownership
	interest in KFN would be less than 1% of KFN's outstanding shares as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.






	Discretionary Investments






	        Certain of KKR's investment professionals, including its principals and other qualifying personnel, are permitted to invest, and have
	invested, their own capital in side-by-side investments with KKR's investment vehicles. Side-by-side investments are made on the same terms and conditions as those acquired by the applicable
	investment vehicle, except that the side-by-side investments are not subject to management fees, incentive fees or a carried interest. The cash invested by these individuals aggregated
	$292.8 million, $108.9 million and $227.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.






	Aircraft and Other Services






	        Certain of the Senior Principals own aircraft that KKR uses for business purposes in the ordinary course of its operations. These
	Senior Principals paid for the purchase of these aircraft with personal funds and bear all operating, personnel and maintenance costs associated with their operation. The hourly rates that KKR pays
	for the use of these aircraft are based on current market rates for chartering private aircraft of the same type. KKR incurred $4.2 million, $4.6 million and $5.0 million for the
	use of these aircraft for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.






	Facilities






	        Certain trusts, whose beneficiaries include children of Mr. Kravis and Mr. Roberts, and certain other Senior Principals
	who are not executive officers of KKR, are partners in a real-estate based partnership that maintains an ownership interest in KKR's Menlo Park location. Payments made to this partnership were
	$7.2 million, $6.8 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

	12. SEGMENT REPORTING





	        KKR transacts its investment advisory business primarily in the United States and the majority of the fees from such business are earned from the United States. KKR operates through
	three reportable business segments. These segments, which are differentiated primarily by their investment objectives and strategies, consist of the following:






	Private Markets






	        Through the Private Markets segment, KKR manages and sponsors a group of private equity funds and co-investment vehicles that invest
	capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. KKR also manages and sponsors a group of funds and co-investment vehicles that
	invest capital in real assets, such as infrastructure, energy and real estate. These funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC
	registered investment adviser.






	Public Markets






	        Through the Public Markets segment, KKR operates its credit and hedge funds businesses. KKR's credit business is managed by KKR Asset
	Management, LLC, or KAM, an SEC registered investment adviser. KAM advises funds, structured finance vehicles, separately managed accounts, business development companies ("BDCs") and other
	investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that invest capital in (i) leveraged credit strategies, such as leveraged loans and high yield bonds and
	(ii) alternative credit strategies such as mezzanine investments, special situations investments, direct lending investments and long/short credit. In addition to KKR's
	credit business, KKR has a hedge funds business that offers a variety of investment strategies and focuses on providing investment solutions for institutional investors. These strategies are managed
	by KAM and Prisma Capital Partners LP, or KKR Prisma, an SEC registered investment adviser. This business offers customized hedge fund portfolios, hedge fund-of-fund solutions and a long/short
	equity strategy. In addition, on January 23, 2013, we acquired a 24.9% interest in Nephila Capital Ltd. ("Nephila"), an investment manager focused on investing in natural catastrophe and
	weather risk.






	Capital Markets and Principal Activities






	        The Capital Markets and Principal Activities segment combines KKR's principal assets with its global capital markets business. KKR's
	capital markets business supports the firm, portfolio companies and third-party clients by developing and implementing both traditional and non-traditional capital solutions for investments or
	companies seeking financing. These services include arranging debt and equity financing for transactions, placing and underwriting securities offerings and providing other types of capital markets
	services. When KKR underwrites an offering of securities or a loan on a firm commitment basis, KKR commits to buy and sell an issue of securities or indebtedness and generate revenue by purchasing the
	securities or indebtedness at a discount or for a fee. When KKR acts in an agency capacity, KKR generates revenue for arranging financing or placing securities or debt with capital markets investors.
	KKR's principal assets, which include investments in KKR's investment funds and co-investments in certain portfolio companies of such funds, provide KKR with a significant source of capital to further
	grow and expand the business, increase participation in KKR's existing portfolio of businesses and further align KKR's interests with those of KKR's fund investors and other stakeholders.

	12. SEGMENT REPORTING (Continued)







	Key Performance Measures






	        The segment key performance measures that follow are used by management in making operating and resource deployment decisions as well
	as assessing the overall performance of each of KKR's reportable business segments. The reportable segments for KKR's business are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss)
	between KKR & Co. L.P. and KKR Holdings and as such represents the business in total. In addition, KKR's reportable segments are presented without giving effect to the
	consolidation of the funds that KKR manages.






	Fee Related Earnings ("FRE")






	        FRE is comprised of segment fees less segment expenses (other than certain compensation and general and administrative expenses
	incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income). This measure is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating earnings of KKR and its business segments
	before investment income. The components of FRE on a segment basis differ from the equivalent GAAP amounts on a consolidated basis as a result of: (i) the inclusion of management fees earned
	from consolidated funds that were eliminated in consolidation; (ii) the exclusion of fees and expenses of certain consolidated entities; (iii) the exclusion of charges relating to the
	amortization of intangible assets; (iv) the exclusion of charges relating to carry pool allocations; (v) the exclusion of non-cash equity charges and other non-cash compensation charges
	borne by KKR Holdings or incurred under the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan; (vi) the exclusion of certain reimbursable expenses; and (vii) the exclusion
	of certain non-recurring items.






	Economic Net Income ("ENI")






	        ENI is a measure of profitability for KKR's reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the
	operating and investment earnings of KKR and its business segments. ENI is comprised of: (i) FRE plus (ii) segment investment income (loss), which is reduced for carry pool allocations,
	management fee refunds, interest expense and certain compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in the generation of net realized principal investment income; less
	(iii) certain economic interests in KKR's segments held by third parties. ENI differs from net income (loss) on a GAAP basis as a result of: (i) the exclusion of the items referred to in
	FRE above; (ii) the exclusion of investment income (loss) relating to noncontrolling interests; and (iii) the exclusion of income taxes.






	Book Value






	        Book Value is a measure of the net assets of KKR's reportable segments and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized
	value of KKR's investment portfolio, including carried interest, as well as KKR's overall liquidity position. Book value differs from KKR & Co. L.P. Partners' Capital on a GAAP
	basis primarily as a result of the exclusion of ownership interests attributable to KKR Holdings.

	companies
	("Fee Credits"). Fund investors receive Fee Credits only with respect to monitoring and transaction fees that are allocable to the fund's investment in the portfolio company and not, for
	example, any fees allocable to capital invested through co-investment vehicles. Fee Credits are calculated after deducting certain fund-related expenses and generally amount to 80% of allocable
	monitoring and transaction fees after fund-related expenses are recovered, although the actual percentage may vary from fund to fund as well as among different classes of investors within a fund.






	(2)




	With
	respect to KKR's active and future investment funds and co-investment vehicles that provide for carried interest, KKR will allocate to its principals,
	other professionals and selected other individuals a portion of the carried interest earned in relation to these funds as part of its carry pool.






	(3)




	Certain
	of KKR's private equity funds require the management company to refund up to 20% of any cash management fees earned from fund investors in the event
	that the funds recognize a carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned or a portion thereof, a
	liability to the fund investors is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the cash management fees earned. As of December 31,
	2013, carried interest earned was sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned. The refunds to the fund investors are paid, and the liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying
	investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized. In the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover any of the amount that represents 20% of the cash
	management fees earned, these fees would not be returned to the fund investors, in accordance with the respective fund agreements.

	KKR's

	monitoring and transaction fees received from portfolio

	companies.
	Fund investors receive Fee Credits only with respect to monitoring and transaction fees that are allocable to the fund's investment in the portfolio company and not, for example, any fees
	allocable to capital invested through co-investment vehicles. Fee Credits are calculated after deducting certain fund-related expenses and generally amount to 80% of allocable monitoring and
	transaction fees after fund-related expenses are recovered, although the actual percentage may vary from fund to fund as well as among different classes of investors within a fund.






	(2)




	With
	respect to KKR's active and future investment funds and co-investment vehicles that provide for carried interest, KKR will allocate to its principals,
	other professionals and selected other individuals a portion of the carried interest earned in relation to these funds as part of its carry pool.






	(3)




	Certain
	of KKR's private equity funds require the management company to refund up to 20% of any cash management fees earned from fund investors in the event
	that the funds recognize a carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned or a portion thereof, a
	liability to the fund's fund investors is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the cash management fees earned. As of
	December 31, 2012, carried interest earned was sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned. The refunds to the fund investors are paid, and the liabilities relieved, at such time
	that the underlying investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized. In the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover any of the amount that represents 20%
	of the cash management fees earned, these fees would not be returned to the fund investors, in accordance with the respective fund agreements.

	in the portfolio company and not, for example, any fees allocable to capital invested through

	vehicles. Fee Credits are calculated after deducting certain fund-related expenses and generally amount to 80% of allocable monitoring and transaction fees after fund-related expenses
	are recovered, although the actual percentage may vary from fund to fund as well as among different classes of investors within a fund.

	With
	respect to KKR's active and future investment funds and co-investment vehicles that provide for carried interest, KKR will allocate to its principals,
	other professionals and selected other individuals a portion of the carried interest earned in relation to these funds as part of its carry pool.






	(3)




	Certain
	of KKR's private equity funds require the management company to refund up to 20% of any cash management fees earned from fund investors in the event
	that the funds recognize a carried interest. At such time as the fund recognizes a carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the cash management fees earned or a portion thereof, a
	liability to the fund's fund investors is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the cash management fees earned. As of
	December 31, 2011, the amount subject to refund for which no liability was recorded was approximately $91.4 million as a result of certain funds not yet recognizing sufficient carried
	interest. The refunds to the fund investors are paid, and the liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying investments are sold and the associated carried interests are realized. In the
	event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover any of the amount that represents 20% of the cash management fees earned, these fees would not be returned to the fund investors, in
	accordance with the respective fund agreements.

	Acquisition of Prisma






	        On October 1, 2012, KKR completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Prisma Capital Partners LP and its
	affiliates ("KKR Prisma"). KKR Prisma constructs and manages customized hedge fund portfolios and hedge funds-of-funds. The addition of KKR Prisma provides KKR with a new hedge fund-of-funds strategy
	and a greater presence in the hedge funds space, from which KKR can create and offer more liquid products for KKR's fund investors.




	        Initial
	consideration transferred was $200.0 million in cash, and KKR may also become obligated to make future additional payments (referred to hereafter as "contingent
	consideration") to the sellers (certain of which are now employees of KKR) in years 2014 and 2017 based on the KKR Prisma

	        As
	of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated to be $122.8 million and $71.3 million, respectively, has been
	recorded as a liability within Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. The fair value of the contingent
	consideration was derived using Level III inputs. This amount was determined based on the expected value of a range of undiscounted cash flows of $0 to $155.0 million in each of 2014 and
	2017, that considered, among other things probability, risk-weighting, and other adjustments that KKR has determined to be applicable.




	        The
	consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes the financial results of KKR Prisma since the date of acquisition, October 1, 2012,
	through December 31, 2012. During this period, KKR Prisma's fees and net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. were $17.2 million and $1.1 million,
	respectively. This net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. reflects amortization of intangible assets and equity based compensation charges associated with KKR Prisma
	since the date of the acquisition. Additionally, the portion of net income that is allocable to KKR reflects KKR's approximate 36.9% ownership interest in the KKR Group Partnerships after applicable
	corporate and local income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2012. On a segment basis, the financial results of KKR Prisma are included within the Public Markets segment.




	        The
	information that follows provides supplemental information about pro forma fees and net income (loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. as if the acquisition of KKR
	Prisma had been consummated as of January 1, 2011. Such information is unaudited and is based on estimates and assumptions which KKR believes are reasonable. These results are not necessarily
	indicative of the consolidated statements of operations in future periods or the results that would have actually been realized had KKR and KKR Prisma been a combined entity during 2012 and 2011. On a
	pro forma basis for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, (i) fees would be estimated to be $612.8 million and $782.0 million, respectively, (ii) net income
	(loss) attributable to KKR & Co. L.P. would be estimated to be $563.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively, (iii) net income (loss) attributable to

	KKR & Co. L.P. per common unitdiluted would be estimated to be $2.22 and $0.02, respectively.




	        KKR
	incurred $3.7 million of acquisition related costs which were expensed as incurred and are reflected within General, Administrative and Other Expense on the consolidated
	statement of operations.





	14. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS







	Goodwill






	        Goodwill from the acquisition of KKR Prisma represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and
	intangible assets acquired. The carrying value of goodwill was $89.0 million as of December 31, 2013 and is recorded within Other Assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of
	financial condition. This goodwill has been allocated entirely to the Public Markets Segment. As of December 31, 2013, the fair value of KKR's reportable segments substantially exceeded their
	respective carrying values. All of the goodwill is currently expected to be deductible for tax purposes. See Note 7 "Other Assets and Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities."

	15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES







	Acquisition of KFN






	        On December 16, 2013, KKR, affiliates of KKR and KFN, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"),
	pursuant to which KFN would become a subsidiary of KKR Fund Holdings (the "Merger"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. KFN is managed by KKR Financial
	Advisors LLC, a subsidiary of KKR, pursuant to a management agreement. Completion of the merger is subject to various conditions.




	        At
	the effective time of the merger, each common share of KFN issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (excluding any common shares held by KKR Fund Holdings or any
	of its subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive 0.51 KKR common units together with cash in lieu of fractional units.






	Debt Covenants






	        Borrowings of KKR contain various debt covenants. These covenants do not, in management's opinion, materially restrict KKR's investment
	or financing strategies. KKR is in compliance with its debt covenants in all material respects.






	Investment Commitments






	        As of December 31, 2013, KKR had unfunded commitments consisting of (i) $1,172.0 million to its active private
	equity and other investment vehicles, and (ii) $244.7 million in connection with commitments by KKR's capital markets business and certain other investment commitments. Whether these
	amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part depends on the terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to funding.






	Non-cancelable Operating Leases






	        KKR's non-cancelable operating leases consist primarily of leases of office space around the world. There are no material rent
	holidays, contingent rent, rent concessions or leasehold improvement incentives associated with any of these property leases. In addition to base rentals, certain lease agreements are subject to
	escalation provisions and rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement.




	        As
	of December 31, 2013, the approximate aggregate minimum future lease payments, net of sublease income, required on the operating leases are as follows:

	15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)







	Contingent Repayment Guarantees






	        The partnership documents governing KKR's carrypaying funds, including funds relating to private equity, mezzanine,
	infrastructure, energy, real estate, direct lending and special situations investments, generally include a "clawback" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring
	the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. Under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a fund, the general
	partner is required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry
	distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, including the effects of any performance thresholds.
	Excluding carried interest received by the general partners of funds that were not contributed to KKR in the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of KKR & Co. (Guernsey) L.P.
	(formerly known as KKR Private Equity Investors, L.P.) on October 1, 2009 (the "KPE Transaction"), as of December 31, 2013, no carried interest was subject to this clawback
	obligation, assuming that all applicable carry paying funds were liquidated at their December 31, 2013 fair values. Had the investments in such funds been liquidated at zero value, the clawback
	obligation would have been $1,350.7 million. Carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as
	if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by
	the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts earned
	decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during
	the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any,
	is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a
	reduction of KKR's investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded.




	        Certain
	private equity funds that were contributed to KKR in the KPE Transaction in 2009 also include a "net loss sharing provision." Upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to
	which a net loss sharing obligation applies, the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In these vehicles, such losses would be
	required to be paid by KKR to the fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed, and a greater
	share of investment losses would be allocable to KKR relative to the capital that KKR contributed to it as general partner. Based on the fair market values as of December 31, 2013, there would
	have been no net loss sharing obligation. If the vehicles were liquidated at zero value, the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately $496.4 million as of December 31,
	2013.




	        Prior
	to the KPE Transaction in 2009, certain KKR principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to KKR had personally
	guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners

	of
	such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. The terms of the KPE Transaction require that KKR principals remain responsible
	for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the KPE Transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Through investment realizations, this amount has been
	reduced to $217.8 million as of December 31, 2013. Using valuations as of December 31, 2013, no amounts are due with respect to the clawback obligation required to be funded by
	KKR principals. Carry distributions arising subsequent to the KPE Transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to KKR and KKR's principals who participate in the
	carry pool. Unlike the clawback obligation, KKR will be responsible for all amounts due under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify KKR's principals for any personal guarantees that they
	have provided with respect to such amounts. In addition, guarantees of or similar arrangements relating to clawback or net loss sharing obligations in favor of third party investors in an individual
	investment partnership by entities KKR owns may limit distributions of carried interest more generally.






	Indemnifications






	        In the normal course of business, KKR enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide
	general indemnifications. In addition, certain of KKR's consolidated funds have provided certain indemnities relating to environmental and other matters and has provided nonrecourse carve-out
	guarantees for fraud, willful misconduct and other customary wrongful acts, each in connection with the financing of certain real estate investments that KKR has made. KKR's maximum exposure under
	these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against KKR that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, KKR expects the risk of material loss to be
	low.






	Litigation






	        From time to time, KKR is involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of KKR's business. KKR's
	business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against it.

	15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)





	        On May 23, 2011, KKR, certain KKR affiliates and the board of directors of Primedia Inc. (a former KKR portfolio company whose directors at that time included certain KKR
	personnel) were named as defendants, along with others, in two shareholder class action complaints filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware challenging the sale of Primedia in a merger
	transaction that was completed on July 13, 2011. These actions allege, among other things, that Primedia board members, KKR, and certain KKR affiliates, breached their fiduciary duties by
	entering into the merger agreement at an unfair price and failing to disclose all material information about the merger. Plaintiffs also allege that the merger price was unfair in light of the value
	of certain shareholder derivative claims, which were dismissed on August 8, 2011, based on a stipulation by the parties that the derivative plaintiffs and any other former Primedia shareholders
	lost standing to prosecute the derivative claims on behalf of Primedia when the Primedia merger was completed. The dismissed shareholder derivative claims included allegations concerning open market
	purchases of certain shares of Primedia's preferred stock by KKR affiliates in 2002 and allegations concerning Primedia's redemption of certain shares of Primedia's preferred stock in 2004 and 2005,
	some of which were owned by KKR affiliates. With respect to the pending shareholder class actions challenging the Primedia merger, on June 7, 2011, the Court of Chancery denied a motion to
	preliminarily enjoin the merger. On July 18, 2011, the Court of Chancery consolidated the two pending shareholder class actions and appointed lead counsel for plaintiffs. On October 7,
	2011, defendants moved to dismiss the operative complaint in the consolidated shareholder class action. The operative complaint seeks, in relevant part, unspecified monetary damages and rescission of
	the merger. On December 2, 2011, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, which similarly alleges that the Primedia board members, KKR, and certain KKR affiliates breached their
	respective fiduciary duties by entering into the merger agreement at an unfair price in light of the value of the dismissed shareholder derivative claims. That amended complaint seeks an unspecified
	amount of monetary damages. On January 31, 2012, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On May 10, 2013, the Court of Chancery denied the motion to dismiss the complaint as
	it relates to the Primedia board members, KKR and certain KKR affiliates. On July 1, 2013, KKR and other defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that plaintiff's
	claims were barred by the statute of limitations. On December 20, 2013, the Court of Chancery granted the motion in part and denied the motion in part.




	        Additionally,
	in May 2011, two shareholder class actions challenging the Primedia merger were filed in Georgia state courts, asserting similar allegations and seeking similar relief as
	initially sought by the
	Delaware shareholder class actions above. Both Georgia actions have been stayed in favor of the Delaware action.




	        In
	December 2007, KKR, along with 15 other private equity firms and investment banks, were named as defendants in a purported class action complaint filed in the United States District
	Court for the District of Massachusetts by shareholders in certain public companies acquired by private equity firms since 2003. In August 2008, KKR, along with 16 other private equity firms and
	investment banks, were named as defendants in a purported consolidated amended class action complaint. The suit alleges that from mid-2003 defendants have violated antitrust laws by allegedly
	conspiring to rig bids, restrict the supply of private equity financing, fix the prices for target companies at artificially low levels, and divide up an alleged market for private equity services for
	leveraged buyouts. The amended complaint seeks injunctive relief on behalf of all persons who sold securities to any of the defendants in leveraged buyout transactions and specifically challenges nine
	transactions. The first stage of discovery concluded on or about April 15, 2010. On August 18, 2010, the court granted plaintiffs' motion to

	proceed
	to a second stage of discovery in part and denied it in part. Specifically, the court granted a second stage of discovery as to eight additional transactions but denied a second stage of
	discovery as to any transactions beyond the additional eight specified transactions. On October 7, 2010, the plaintiffs filed under seal a fourth amended complaint that includes new factual
	allegations concerning the additional eight transactions and the original nine transactions. The fourth amended complaint also includes eight purported sub-classes of plaintiffs seeking unspecified
	monetary damages and/or restitution with respect to eight of the original nine challenged transactions and new separate claims against two of the original nine challenged transactions. On
	January 13, 2011, the court granted a motion filed by KKR and certain other defendants to dismiss all claims alleged by a putative damages sub-class in connection with the acquisition of
	PanAmSat Corp. and separate claims for relief related to the PanAmSat transaction. The second phase of discovery permitted by the court is completed. On July 11, 2011, plaintiffs filed a motion
	seeking leave to file a proposed fifth amended complaint that seeks to challenge ten additional transactions in addition to the transactions identified in the previous complaints. Defendants
	opposed plaintiffs' motion. On September 7, 2011, the court granted plaintiffs' motion in part and denied it in part. Specifically, the court granted a third stage of limited discovery as to
	the ten additional transactions identified in plaintiffs' proposed fifth amended complaint but denied plaintiffs' motion seeking leave to file a proposed fifth amended complaint. On
	June 14, 2012, following the completion of the third phase of discovery, plaintiffs filed a fifth amended complaint which, like their proposed fifth amended complaint, seeks to challenge ten
	additional transactions in addition to the transactions identified in the previous complaints. On June 22, 2012, defendants filed a motion to dismiss certain claims asserted in the fifth
	amended complaint. On July 18, 2012, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss, dismissing certain previously released claims against certain defendants. On
	March 13, 2013, the United States District Court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment on the count involving KKR. However, the court narrowed plaintiffs' claim to an alleged
	overarching agreement to refrain from jumping other defendants' announced proprietary transactions, thereby limiting the case to a smaller number of transactions subject to plaintiffs' claim. KKR
	filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on April 16, 2013, which the court denied on July 18, 2013. Plaintiffs moved for class certification on October 21, 2013. Defendants
	filed
	their opposition to the motion on January 24, 2014. The Court is scheduled to hear the motion for class certification on or after May 19, 2014. A trial date has been scheduled on or
	after November 3, 2014.




	        Since
	December 19, 2013, multiple putative class action lawsuits have been filed in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, the United States District Court of
	the District of Northern California, and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by KFN shareholders against KFN, individual members of KFN's board of directors, KKR, and certain of KKR's
	affiliates in connection with KFN's entry into a merger agreement pursuant to which it would become a subsidiary of KKR. These actions allege variously that the members of the KFN board of directors
	breached fiduciary duties owed to KFN shareholders by approving the proposed transaction for inadequate consideration; approving the proposed transaction in order to obtain benefits not equally shared
	by other KFN shareholders; entering into the merger agreement containing preclusive deal protection devices; failing to take steps to maximize the value to be paid to the KFN shareholders; and failing
	to disclose material information necessary for KFN shareholders to make a fully informed decision about the proposed transaction. The actions also allege variously that KKR, and certain of KKR's
	affiliates aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and that KKR is a controlling stockholder of

	KFN
	by means of a management agreement between KFN and KKR Financial Advisors LLC, a subsidiary of KKR, and KKR breached a fiduciary duty it allegedly owed to KFN stockholders by causing KFN to
	enter into the merger agreement. The relief sought in these actions includes, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief concerning the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and the proposed
	transaction, rescission, an accounting by defendants, damages and attorneys' fees and costs, and other relief.

	currently is and expects to continue to become, from time to time, subject to examinations, inquiries and investigations by various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory
	agencies, including but not limited to the Securities Exchange Commission, Department of Justice, state attorney generals, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the U.K. Financial Conduct
	Authority. Such examinations, inquiries and investigations may result in the commencement of a civil or criminal lawsuit against KKR or its personnel.




	        Moreover,
	in the ordinary course of business, KKR is and can be both the defendant and the plaintiff in numerous lawsuits with respect to acquisitions, bankruptcy, insolvency and other
	types of proceedings. Such lawsuits may involve claims that adversely affect the value of certain investments owned by KKR's funds.




	        KKR
	establishes an accrued liability for legal proceedings only when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be
	an exposure
	to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. No loss contingency is recorded for matters where such losses are either not probable or reasonably estimable (or both) at the time of determination. Such
	matters are subject to many uncertainties, including among others (i) the proceedings are in early stages; (ii) damages sought are unspecified, unsupportable, unexplained or uncertain;
	(iii) discovery has not been started or is incomplete; (iv) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (v) there are significant factual issues to be
	resolved; or (vi) there are novel legal issues or unsettled legal theories to be presented or a large number of parties. Consequently, management is unable to estimate a range of potential
	loss, if any, related to these matters. For one or more of the matters described above for which a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, KKR has estimated the aggregate amount of losses
	attributable to KKR to be approximately $37.5 million. KKR believes such losses may be, in part, subject to insurance and/or indemnity, which KKR believes may reduce any ultimate loss. This
	estimate is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. Actual outcomes may vary significantly from this estimate.




	        It
	is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending legal proceedings, and some of the matters discussed above seek potentially large and/or indeterminate amounts. As of
	such date, based on information known by management, management has not concluded that the final resolutions of the matters above will have a material effect upon the consolidated financial
	statements. However, given the potentially large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of investigations and litigations, it is possible
	that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on KKR's financial results in any particular period.

	16. REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS





	        KKR has a registered broker-dealer subsidiary which is subject to the minimum net capital
	requirements of the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). Additionally, KKR has an entity based in London which is subject to the capital requirements of the U.K. Financial
	Conduct Authority, another entity based in Hong Kong which is subject to the capital requirements of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Ordinance, an entity based in Japan subject to the capital
	requirements of Financial Services Authority of Japan, and two entities based in Mumbai which are subject to capital requirements of the Reserve Bank of India ("RBI") and Securities and Exchange Board
	of India ("SEBI"). All of these broker dealer entities have continuously operated in excess of their respective minimum regulatory capital requirements.




	        The
	regulatory capital requirements referred to above may restrict KKR's ability to withdraw capital from its registered broker-dealer entities. At December 31, 2013,
	approximately $97.0 million of cash at KKR's registered broker-dealer entities may be restricted as to the payment of cash dividends and advances to KKR.

	18. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS







	Distribution






	        A distribution of $0.48 per KKR & Co. L.P. common unit was announced on February 6, 2014, and will be paid
	on March 4, 2014 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February 18, 2014. KKR Holdings will receive its pro rata share of the distribution from the KKR Group
	Partnerships. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, distributions declared per KKR & Co. L.P. Common Unit were $1.40, $1.22 and $0.74, respectively.






	Acquisition of Avoca Capital






	        Subsequent to December 31, 2013, KKR closed its previously announced acquisition of Avoca Capital and its affiliates ("Avoca"),
	a European credit investment manager with approximately $8.4 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2013. The purchase price was payable by KKR at the closing in cash and
	securities representing the right to receive up to 5.0 million KKR & Co. L.P. common units.




	        In
	accordance with GAAP, the acquisition of Avoca will be accounted for as a business combination which requires that the consideration exchanged and net assets acquired be recorded at
	their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in the acquisition are expected to consist primarily of certain management contracts providing economic rights to
	management, incentive and other fees from existing assets managed by Avoca.




	        KKR
	is currently in the process of determining the purchase accounting impact of the acquisition including the amounts recognized as of the closing date for each major class of assets
	acquired and liabilities assumed. In addition, KKR is also in the process of evaluating whether or not the Avoca funds and vehicles are required to be consolidated.

	ITEM 9A    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES






	        Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
	control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
	such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such
	evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are at the reasonable assurance level:
	(i) effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information on a timely basis that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act;
	and (ii) effective in ensuring that information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
	including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.






	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting






	        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
	over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company's principal executive and principal
	financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
	financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures
	that:






	




	Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
	dispositions of the assets of the company;








	




	Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
	accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
	company; and








	




	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
	the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.






	        Our
	management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set
	forth by the
	Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, that was issued in 1992.




	        Based
	on its assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

	Henry Kravis and George Roberts, who also serve as our Co-Chief Executive Officers and are authorized to appoint our other officers. Our Managing Partner does not have any economic interest in our
	partnership.

	Independence and Composition of the Board of Directors





	        Our Managing Partner's board of directors consists of eight directors, six of whom, Messrs. Grundfest, Hess, Rampl, Schoewe and
	Scully and Ms. Russo, are independent under NYSE rules relating to corporate governance matters and the independence standards described in our corporate governance guidelines. While we are
	exempt from NYSE rules relating to board independence, our Managing Partner intends to maintain a board of directors that consists of at least a majority of directors who are independent under NYSE
	rules relating to corporate governance matters. In addition, the board has considered transactions between KKR and the companies and organizations on whose boards our directors also serve or where our
	directors serve as executive officers, and employment relationships with an immediate family member of a director.






	Board Committees






	        Our Managing Partner's board of directors has four standing committees: an audit committee, a conflicts committee, a nominating and
	corporate governance committee and an executive committee that operate pursuant to written charters as described below. Because we are a limited partnership, our Managing Partner's board is not
	required by NYSE rules to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee or to meet other substantive NYSE corporate governance requirements. While the board has
	established a nominating and governance committee, we rely on available exemptions concerning the committee's composition and mandate.






	Audit Committee






	        The audit committee consists of Messrs. Grundfest (Chairman), Schoewe and Scully. The purpose of the audit committee is to
	assist the board of directors in overseeing and monitoring: (i) the quality and integrity of our financial statements, including investment valuation; (ii) our compliance with legal and
	regulatory requirements; (iii) our independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence; and (iv) the performance of our independent registered public
	accounting firm. The members of the audit committee meet the independence standards and financial literacy requirements for service on an audit committee of a board of directors pursuant to the
	Exchange Act and NYSE rules applicable to audit committees. The Managing Partner's board of directors has determined that each of Messrs. Grundfest, Schoewe and Scully is an "audit committee
	financial expert" within the meaning of Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. The audit committee has a charter which is available at the Investor Center section of our internet website at
	www.kkr.com.






	Conflicts Committee






	        The conflicts committee consists of Messrs. Grundfest, Hess, Rampl, Schoewe and Scully and Ms. Russo. The conflicts
	committee is responsible for reviewing specific matters that the board of directors believes may involve a conflict of interest and for enforcing our rights under any of the




	261











	Table of Contents





	exchange
	agreement, the tax receivable agreement, the limited partnership agreement of any KKR Group Partnership or our limited partnership agreement, which we refer collectively to as the covered
	agreements, against KKR Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries and designees, a general partner or limited partner of KKR Holdings, or a person who holds a partnership or equity interest in the
	foregoing entities. The conflicts committee is also authorized to take any action pursuant to any authority or rights granted to such committee under any covered agreement or with respect to any
	amendment, supplement, modification or waiver to any such agreement that would purport to modify such authority or rights. In addition, the conflicts committee shall approve any amendment to any of
	the covered agreements that in the reasonable judgment of our Managing Partner's board of directors is or will result in a conflict of interest. The conflicts committee will determine if the
	resolution of any conflict of interest submitted to it is fair and reasonable to our partnership. Any matters approved by the conflicts committee will be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable
	to our partnership and not a breach of any duties that may be owed to our unitholders. In addition, the conflicts committee may review and approve any related person transactions, other than those
	that are approved pursuant to our related person policy, as described under "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director IndependenceStatement of Policy Regarding
	Transactions with Related Persons," and may establish guidelines or rules to cover specific categories of transactions. The members of the conflicts committee meet the independence standards under our
	corporate governance guidelines as required for service on the conflicts committee in accordance with its charter.






	Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee






	        The nominating and corporate governance committee consists of Messrs. Kravis, Roberts and Scully. The nominating and corporate
	governance committee is responsible for identifying and recommending candidates for appointment to the board of directors and for assisting and advising the board of directors with respect to matters
	relating to the general operation of the board and corporate governance matters. Mr. Scully meets the independence standards under the
	rules of the NYSE as required for service on the nominating and corporate governance committee in accordance with its charter.






	Executive Committee






	        The executive committee consists of Messrs. Kravis and Roberts. The purpose of the executive committee is to act, when
	necessary, in place of our Managing Partner's full board of directors during periods in which the board is not in session. The executive committee is authorized and empowered to act as if it were the
	full board of directors in overseeing our business and affairs, except that it is not authorized or empowered to take actions that have been specifically delegated to other board committees or to take
	actions with respect to: (i) the declaration of distributions on our common units; (ii) a merger or consolidation of our partnership with or into another entity; (iii) a sale,
	lease or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; (iv) a liquidation or dissolution of our partnership; (v) any action that must be submitted to a vote of our Managing
	Partner's members or our unitholders; or (vi) any action that may not be delegated to a board committee under our Managing Partner's limited liability company agreement or the Delaware Limited
	Liability Company Act.





	Code of Business Conduct and Ethics





	        We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which applies to our principal executive officers, principal financial officer and
	principal accounting officer and is available on our internet website at www.kkr.com under the "Investor Center" section. In accordance with, and to the extent required by the rules and regulations of
	the Securities and Exchange Commission, we intend to disclose any amendment to or waiver of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on behalf of an executive officer or director either on our internet
	website or in a Current Report on Form 8-K filing.

	Table of Contents






	Corporate Governance Guidelines





	        Our Managing Partner's board of directors has a governance policy which addresses matters such as the board of directors'
	responsibilities and duties, the board of directors' composition and compensation and director independence. The governance guidelines are available on our internet website at www.kkr.com under the
	"Investor Center" section.





	Communications to the Board of Directors





	        The non-management members of our Managing Partner's board of directors meet regularly. At each meeting of the non-management members,
	the non-management directors choose a director to lead the meeting. All interested parties, including any employee or unitholder, may send communications to the non-management members of our Managing
	Partner's board of directors by writing to: the General Counsel, KKR & Co. L.P., 9 West 57

	th

	 Street, Suite 4200, New York, New York 10019.





	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance





	        Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, requires the executive officers and directors of our general partner, and persons who
	beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Partnership's equity securities to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC and furnish
	the Partnership with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such reports or written representations from such persons that
	they were not required to file a Form 5 to report previously unreported ownership or changes in ownership, we believe that, with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31,
	2013, such persons complied with all such filing requirements.














	ITEM 11.    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION








	Compensation Discussion and Analysis







	Compensation Philosophy





	        Our compensation program has three primary objectives: (1) to attract, motivate and retain our employees, (2) to align
	their interests with those of our unitholders and fund investors, and (3) to reinforce our culture and values.





	        Our employees.



	    Our business as an investment firm is dependent on the services of our principals
	(including our named executive officers) and other employees. Among other things, we depend on their ability to find, select and execute investments, manage and improve portfolio company operations,
	find and develop relationships with fund investors and other sources of capital, and provide other services, and we cannot compete without their continued employment with us. Therefore, it is
	important that our key employees are compensated in a manner that motivates them to excel and encourages them to remain with the firm.





	        Alignment of interests.



	    Management equity ownership in the businesses in which we invest has been a guiding principle throughout our
	firm's history,
	and we apply that principle to ourselves: every employee of the firm is expected to have an equity interest in us. This equity ownership serves to align the interests of our employees with those of
	our unitholders. In addition, because we invest in and alongside our investment funds and have a carry pool from which we can allocate to our principals 40% of the carried interest that we generate
	through our business, we believe that our principals' interests are also aligned with those of our investors in the funds, vehicles and accounts that we manage, which in turn benefits our unitholders.




	263











	Table of Contents






	        Culture and values.



	    One of our most important values is our "one-firm" approach with shared responsibility and success, and we subscribe
	to a culture
	of meritocracy and fairness. Therefore, compensation is based on the performance of the firm as a whole and on an individual's contributions to the firm. For example, we do not compensate people based
	merely on an individual's accomplishments in relation to the profits and losses of his or her business unit. In addition, we conduct, at least annually, an evaluation process that seeks input from a
	wide range of persons on an employee's contribution to the firm, including his or her commitment to the firm's culture and values. We believe that using this kind of an evaluation process also
	promotes a measure of objectivity as a balance to a single manager's judgment.




	        We
	refer to our two Co-Chief Executive Officers, our Chief Administrative Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our General Counsel as our "named executive officers." We believe that
	the elements of compensation discussed below for our named executive officers serve these primary objectives. We, as a limited partnership with no annual meeting of unitholders, are not required to
	conduct say-on-pay or say-on-frequency votes as provided in the Dodd-Frank Act. However, we intend periodically to review the elements of our compensation, and we may make changes to the compensation
	structure relating to one or more named executive officers based on the outcome of such reviews from time to time.





	KKR Holdings





	        Each of our named executive officers holds interests in our business through KKR Holdings, which is the entity that indirectly owns all
	of the outstanding KKR Group Partnership Units that are not allocable to us.




	        KKR
	Holdings units are, subject to certain restrictions, exchangeable for our common units, on a one-for-one basis, and generally cannot be sold to third parties for monetary value
	unless they are first exchanged for our common units. Because KKR Holdings units are exchangeable for our common units, we believe that our named executive officers' interests are aligned with those
	of our unitholders.




	        KKR
	Holdings, from time to time, receives distributions that are made on KKR Group Partnership Units that are held by it. To the extent such distributions are received on KKR Group
	Partnership Units that underlie any KKR Holdings units that have satisfied their respective service-based vesting requirements, if any, at the time distributions are declared on the underlying KKR
	Group Partnership Units, such distributions will be allocated and further distributed to the named executive officers as and when received. To the extent that such distributions are made on KKR Group
	Partnership Units underlying any KKR Holdings units that have not satisfied the service-based vesting requirements at the time distributions are declared on the underlying KKR Group Partnership Units,
	such distributions may be allocated or otherwise applied in such amounts and in such manner as our Co-Chief Executive Officers, acting through the general partner of KKR Holdings, may determine.
	Service-based vesting requirements are generally three to five years from the date of grant. It is contemplated that such distributions with respect to unvested KKR Holdings units will generally be
	paid to our named executive officers and our other principals as annual bonus compensation from time to time.




	        In
	2013, our named executive officers received distributions on their vested KKR Holdings units, and because these distributions are not considered to be compensation, they have not been
	reported in the Summary Compensation Table.





	Compensation Elements







	Base Salary






	        For 2013, each of our named executive officers was paid an annual salary of $300,000. We believe that the base salary of our named
	executive officers should typically not be the most significant




	264











	Table of Contents





	component
	of total compensation. Our Co-Chief Executive Officers determined that this amount was a sufficient minimum base salary for our named executive officers and decided that it should be the
	same for all named executive officers. We are responsible for funding this base salary.






	Year-End Bonus Compensation






	        Other than their salary and certain incidental benefits noted below under "Other Compensation," our Co-Chief Executive Officers did not
	receive any additional compensation in 2013. They have decided at this time not to receive any bonus or other amounts from us or from KKR Holdings in excess of distributions payable with respect to
	their KKR Holdings units. Instead, they have decided that year-end bonus payments from KKR Holdings should be made to our other principals in order to motivate and retain them for the benefit of the
	firm.




	        In
	2013, our Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel were awarded additional year-end compensation as bonus payments that were determined by our
	Co-Chief Executive Officers. Our Co-Chief Executive Officers made their subjective determinations by assessing our overall performance and the contributions that our Chief Administrative Officer,
	Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel made to our development and success, as a firm, during the year. Certain factors that were considered when determining the size of the bonus payments for
	our Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel include (i) their respective contributions and accomplishments in 2013 in terms of driving commercial results for
	the firm, leading and managing people, and living the firm's values; (ii) their respective performance and contributions relative to other senior principals in the firm, (iii) their
	respective performance and contributions in 2013 as compared to the prior year, and (iv) the overall financial performance of the firm in 2013 as compared to the prior year based on certain
	financial measures considered by management, including total distributable earnings. More specifically, in assessing Mr. Fisher's contributions, they considered his service as the firm's Chief
	Administrative Officer, his role in overseeing the growth and operations of the firm, his leadership in the development of our real estate business and his leadership on the strategic direction
	of the firm generally. In assessing Mr. Janetschek's contributions, they considered his service as the Chief Financial Officer and his leadership and oversight of our finance, tax and
	accounting functions and his role with respect to strategic initiatives undertaken by the firm. Finally, in assessing Mr. Sorkin's contributions, they considered his leadership and oversight of
	our global legal and compliance functions and his role with respect to the strategic initiatives undertaken by the firm. In part, because the firm's total distributable earnings increased in 2013
	relative to the prior year, the size of the bonus payments was higher in 2013 as a result of the firm's financial performance. In making these determinations, our Co-Chief Executive Officers consulted
	with certain of our senior principals and, with respect to the determinations for our Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel, considered the recommendations of our Chief Administrative Officer.
	We believe that the discretion permitted to our Co-Chief Executive Officers permits them to award bonus compensation in an amount necessary to motivate and retain these named executive officers.




	        Once
	the bonus amount is determined, the bonus amount is divided into cash compensation and, for our named executive officers, a recommendation to our Managing Partner's board of
	directors for an award of deferred equity bonus compensation. The amount of deferred equity bonus compensation for our principals is calculated using a graduated range of percentages applied to
	different incremental amounts of total salary and bonus compensation ranging from 5% to 50%.




	        The
	cash bonus amounts paid to our Chief Administrative Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our General Counsel for 2013 are reflected in the Bonus column of the 2013 Summary
	Compensation Table below. Although these cash bonus payments have been economically borne by KKR Holdings, we expect that, over time, we may be required to pay a portion, or eventually all, of these
	cash bonus payments as KKR Holdings becomes unable to reserve cash for bonus compensation as more KKR Holdings units vest.




	265











	Table of Contents





	        The
	portion of the bonus payment granted to our named executive officers (other than our Co-Chief Executive Officers, who received none) as 2013 deferred equity bonus compensation
	consists of grants of equity awards issued under the Equity Incentive Plan. These equity awards are restricted equity units that may be settled for our common units on a one-for-one basis. See below
	under "Terms of Restricted Equity Units" for more information. We call these equity grants "deferred" equity bonus compensation, because our named executive officers' ability to monetize them into
	cash is deferred to the future when the vesting provisions (and any applicable transfer restrictions) discussed below lapse.




	        The
	number of restricted equity units granted to our named executive officers (other than our Co-Chief Executive Officers, who received none) is determined by our Managing Partner's
	board of directors. As part of 2013 year-end bonus compensation, our Managing Partner's board of directors approved the following grants: 91,265 restricted equity units to our Chief
	Administrative Officer, 38,731 restricted equity units to our Chief Financial Officer, and 37,289 restricted equity units to our General Counsel.
	The number of restricted equity units was determined by dividing the dollar amount of deferred equity bonus compensation recommended by the Co-Chief Executive Officers to the board of directors by the
	average closing price of our common units over the last five trading days in 2013. Because these grants were made after December 31, 2013 and restricted equity units for deferred equity bonus
	compensation are generally issued in the first quarter of the following year, they do not appear in the tables below, but will appear in the tables for the year ended December 31, 2014.




	        The
	restricted equity units that were granted as deferred equity bonus compensation grants in respect of fiscal 2013 year-end compensation are subject to a three-year
	service-based vesting condition (with the first vesting event occurring on April 1, 2015). These restricted equity units are not subject to additional transfer restrictions after vesting or any
	minimum retained ownership requirement. Vesting serves as an employment retention mechanism and thereby enhances the alignment of interests between our named executive officers who receive year-end
	compensation payments and the firm.






	Carried Interest






	        We allocate and distribute to a carry pool 40% of the carried interest that we earn, from which our principals are eligible to receive
	a carried interest allocation. Carry pool allocations for the named executive officers are made by first determining a total dollar value for the named executive officer's interest in the carry pool.
	Due to their unique status as co-founders of our firm, our Co-Chief Executive Officers determine their own allocation from the carry pool. To make this total dollar value determination for the other
	named executive officers, our Co-Chief Executive Officers take into consideration the executive officer's involvement with investments and impact on the portfolio, the size of the executive officer's
	bonus, and other factors similar to those considered when determining the size of the bonus, as described under "Year-End Bonus Compensation". However, the total dollar value available to
	be allocated to the named executive officers and other employees is limited by the total amount of investments made by our investment funds during the fiscal year, and executive officers and other
	employees may not be allocated any dollar value of carry in any given year. After a total dollar value, if any, for each named executive officer is determined, such dollar value is then divided by the
	total value of investments made by our funds for the year, which yields a certain percentage for the named executive officer. This percentage is then applied consistently to each investment made
	during the year. Because the size of each investment is different, the nominal amount of the carry pool allocation differs by investment, although the percentage applied to each investment is
	consistent. The carry pool is maintained and administered by KKR Associates Holdings L.P., which, similar to KKR Holdings, is not a subsidiary of ours. Allocations are determined by our
	Co-Chief Executive Officers acting through the general partner of KKR Associates Holdings L.P.




	        Carried
	interest, if any, from the carry pool in respect of any particular investment is only paid in cash after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred
	(e.g., sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its




	266











	Table of Contents





	inception,
	in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount
	sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. To the extent any "clawback" obligation is triggered, carried interest previously distributed by the fund would have to be returned
	to such fund, thereby reducing the named executive officer's overall compensation for any such year. From time to time, a portion of certain carried interest payable may not be or for certain of our
	funds will not be distributed to the recipient and would instead be held in escrow in order to enhance the recipient's ability to satisfy any future clawback obligation. Because the amount of carried
	interest payable is directly tied to the realized performance of the underlying investments, we believe this fosters a strong alignment of interests among the investors in those funds and the named
	executive officers, and thus benefits our unitholders. In addition, several of our competitors use participation in carried interest as an important compensation element, and we believe that we must
	do the same in order to attract and retain the most qualified personnel.




	        Participation
	in our carry pool for our principals, including our named executive officers, is subject only to service-based vesting with certain exceptions, including acceleration upon
	death or disability. In general, the vesting for carry pool allocations for investments made in 2013 is annual over a four-year period (other than for our Co-Chief Executive Officers). The vesting
	schedules for investments made prior to 2013 range from four-year vesting (with no vesting upon grant) for the most junior principals up to two-year vesting (and 50% vesting upon grant) for most
	senior principals. Vesting serves as an employment retention mechanism and enhances the alignment of interests between a participant in our carry pool and the firm as well as the limited partners in
	our investment funds. Due to their status as co-founders of our firm, our Co-Chief Executive Officers are typically completely vested in their carried interest allocations upon grant.






	Other Compensation






	        Our Co-Chief Executive Officers are reimbursed by us for the use of a car and driver, and we pay for the compensation of certain
	personnel who administer personal matters for them. We believe that these benefits are appropriate in light of the time that they spend on our business, the limited compensation paid by us for their
	services, and their unique status as co-founders of our firm. In addition, we may pay for certain tax preparation fees for our named executive officers.





	Minimum Retained Ownership





	        While employed by us, unless waived in whole or in part, each of our named executive officers is required to hold at least 25% of the
	cumulative amount of KKR Holdings units that have satisfied the service-based vesting condition during the duration of his employment with the firm. In addition, unless waived in whole or in part,
	each of our named executive officers may be required, on a grant by grant basis, to hold common unit equivalents of 15% of the cumulative restricted equity units granted under the Equity Incentive
	Plan that have satisfied the service-based vesting condition during the duration of his employment with the firm.





	Compensation and Risk





	        Our compensation program includes elements that we believe discourages excessive risk-taking and aligns the compensation of our
	employees with the long-term performance of the firm. For example, other than certain equity that either immediately vested as part of the grants to all employees or our founders or that were made in
	exchange for the contribution of assets, in each case in connection with the consummation of the KPE Transaction in October 2009, a significant majority of the equity awards held by our principals are
	subject to a multi-year service vesting condition, one- and two-year transfer restriction periods, and/or a minimum retained ownership requirement. In addition, except in circumstances noted elsewhere
	in this report, the equity awards held by our other employees are also




	267











	Table of Contents





	generally
	subject to a multi-year service vesting condition and may also be subject to post-vesting transfer restrictions and/or a minimum retained ownership requirement. Because our equity awards
	have multi-year vesting provisions, the actual amount of compensation realized by the recipient will be tied to the long-term performance of our common units. Pursuant to our internal policies, our
	employees are not permitted to buy or sell derivative securities, including for hedging purposes, or to engage in short-selling to hedge their economic risk of ownership. In addition, we only make
	cash payments of carried interest to our principals when profitable investments have been realized and after sufficient cash has been distributed to the investors in our funds. Moreover, the general
	partner of a fund is required to return carried interest distributions to the fund due to, for example, underperformance by the relevant fund subsequent to the payment of such carried interest.
	Accordingly, the principal would be subject to a "clawback," i.e., be required to return carried interest payments previously made to a principal, all of which further discourages excessive
	risk-taking by our personnel.






	Summary Compensation Table






	        The following table presents summary information concerning compensation that was paid for services rendered by our named executive
	officers during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013.




	        In
	2011, 2012 and 2013, our named executive officers received distributions based on their vested KKR Holdings units. Because these distributions are not considered to be compensation,
	these distributions are not reflected as compensation in the table below. There are certain contractual arrangements we entered into with KKR Holdings at the time of the KPE Transaction in October
	2009 and thereafter, including a tax receivable agreement, that relate to payments to our named executive officers that are not compensatory and are described in "Certain Relationships and Related
	Transactions, and Director Independence."




	        Carried
	interest distributions to our named executive officers in respect of the carry pool established by KKR Associates Holdings L.P. for the years ended December 31,
	2011, 2012 and 2013 are reflected in the All Other Compensation column in the 2013 Summary Compensation Table below.

	Represents
	distributions received by KKR Holdings with respect to unvested KKR Holdings units that have been distributed to the named executive officer as
	bonus. The discretionary bonus payments in 2011, 2012 and 2013 were made by KKR Holdings and accordingly were not economically borne by us.






	(2)




	Stock
	awards reflected in the table above for each year presented represents grants made in such reporting period relating to the equity portion of the
	prior year bonus compensation. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 amounts reflect the grant date fair value of KKR Holdings units and for the years ended December 31, 2012 and
	2013 restricted equity units. Fair value of the KKR Holdings units and restricted equity units granted to our named executive officers is calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards
	Codification Topic 718, CompensationStock Compensation ("ASC 718"). See Note 10 of the financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information about the
	valuation assumptions with respect to all grants reflected in this column. These amounts reflect the aggregate grant date fair values calculated under ASC Topic 718 and may not correspond to the
	actual value that will be recognized by our named executive officers.






	(3)




	Carried
	interest is presented on the basis of cash received by our named executive officers in the respective fiscal year. We believe that presenting actual
	cash received by our named executive officers is a more representative disclosure of their compensation than presenting accrued carried interest, because carried interest is paid only if and when
	there are profitable realization events relating to the underlying investments. Carried interest also includes amounts retained and allocated for distribution to the respective named executive
	officer, but not yet distributed to the named executive officer, which could be used to fund potential future clawback obligations if any were to arise.






	(4)




	Consists
	of $43,290,590 in cash payments of carried interest from the carry pool during 2013; $40,000 in fees for Mr. Kravis's service as a
	KKR-designated director on the board of directors of First Data Corporation, a KKR portfolio company, during 2013; $23,000 in fees for Mr. Kravis's service as a KKR-designated director on the
	board of directors of China International Capital

	matters for Mr. Kravis during 2013; and $20,000 related to tax preparation fees. SEC rules require that transportation and personnel expenses not directly and integrally related to our business

	awards reflected in the table above represent grants made in the year ended December 31, 2013 relating to the equity portion of the prior year
	bonus compensation. The amounts reflected in this column represent restricted equity units. Each grant of restricted equity units is subject to a service-based vesting condition over a period of three
	years (with the first vesting event occurring on April 1, 2014). The vesting terms of these grants are described under the caption "Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants
	of Plan-Based AwardsTerms of Restricted Equity Units" below.

	Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards







	Terms of KKR Holdings Units






	        The units that our named executive officers and other principals hold in KKR Holdings are subject to transfer restrictions and, except
	for interests held by our Co-Chief Executive Officers and certain interests that were vested when granted in connection with the KPE Transaction in October 2009, subject to multi-year service-based
	vesting requirements. Due to their unique status as co-founders of our firm, our Co-Chief Executive Officers are completely vested in their ownership of KKR Holdings units.




	        In
	general, unvested KKR Holdings units initially vest in equal installments over a multi-year period (which can range from three to five years) from the grant date, subject to the
	recipient's continued employment with us. Following this initial vesting (or the grant date if interests were vested upon grant), interests remain contingently vested while they are subject to certain
	transfer restrictions. Unvested KKR Holdings units are not entitled to receive distributions.




	        KKR
	Holdings units that are subject to transfer restrictions, unless waived, may not be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred for a specified period of time following the initial
	vesting date. The transfer restriction period typically lasts for (1) one year with respect to one-half of the units vesting on the vesting date and (2) two years with respect to the
	other one-half of the units vesting on such vesting date. Transfer restricted units become fully vested and transferable and may be exchanged into common units at the end of the transfer restriction
	period if the holder is not terminated for cause and has complied with the terms of his or her confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreement during the transfer restrictions period. See "Terms of
	Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Agreements" below.




	        Because
	KKR Holdings is a partnership, all of the KKR Holdings units have been legally allocated, but the allocation of certain of these units had not been communicated to each
	respective principal as of December 31, 2013. The units whose allocation has not been communicated are subject to performance-based vesting conditions, which include, (i) whether the
	principal is in good standing and has adhered to our policies and rules, (ii) performance of assigned tasks and duties in an effective, efficient and diligent manner, (iii) contribution
	and commitment to the growth, development and profitability of KKR and our business, (iv) contribution and commitment to our management and general administration; (v) contribution and
	commitment to the culture, business principles, reputation and morale of KKR as a whole and the team or teams to which the principal has been assigned, and
	(vi) contribution and commitment to our recruiting, business development, public image and marketing efforts and the professional development of our personnel. These criteria are not
	sufficiently specific to constitute performance conditions for accounting purposes, and the achievement, or lack thereof, will be determined based upon the exercise of judgment by the general partner
	of KKR Holdings. Each principal will ultimately receive between zero and 100% of the units initially allocated. The allocation of these units has not yet been communicated to the award recipients as
	this was management's decision on how to best incentivize its principals. It is anticipated that additional service-based vesting conditions will be imposed at the time the allocation is initially
	communicated to the respective principals. We applied the guidance of ASC Topic 718 and concluded that these KKR Holdings units do not yet meet the criteria for recognition of compensation cost
	because neither the grant date nor the service inception date has occurred. In reaching a conclusion that the service inception date has not occurred, we considered (1) the fact that the
	vesting conditions are not sufficiently specific to constitute





	271











	Table of Contents






	performance
	conditions for accounting purposes, (2) the significant judgment that can be exercised by the general partner of KKR Holdings in determining whether the vesting conditions are
	ultimately achieved, and (3) the absence of communication to the principals of any information related to the number of units they were initially allocated. The allocation of these units will
	be communicated to the award recipients when the performance-based vesting conditions have been met, and currently there is no plan as to when the communication will occur. The determination as to
	whether the award recipients have satisfied the performance-based vesting conditions is made by the general partner of KKR Holdings, and is based on multiple factors primarily related to the award
	recipients' individual performance.




	        While
	employed by our firm, our principals, including our named executive officers, are also subject to minimum retained ownership rules that require them to continuously hold at least
	25% of their cumulatively vested KKR Holdings units, unless waived.




	        The
	transfer and vesting restrictions and minimum retained ownership rules applicable to KKR Holdings units may not be enforceable in all cases and can be waived, modified or amended by
	KKR Holdings at any time without our consent.




	        The
	terms of the KKR Holdings units described above are distinct from equity awards issuable under our Equity Incentive Plan, which are described below.






	Terms of Restricted Equity Units






	        Restricted equity units are equity awards issuable under our Equity Incentive Plan, which after vesting, may be settled for our common
	units on a one-for-one basis (or an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such common units).




	        In
	general, restricted equity units are subject to a service-based vesting condition and vest in equal annual installments over a multi-year period (generally three to five years) from a
	specified date, subject to the recipient's continued employment with us. Following this service-based vesting, certain restricted equity unit grant agreements may also subject the common units
	delivered upon settlement of such restricted equity units to transfer restrictions and/or minimum retained ownership requirements. Unvested restricted equity units granted under our Equity Incentive
	Plan are not entitled to receive distributions.




	        Common
	units delivered upon settlement of restricted equity units that are subject to transfer restrictions, unless waived, typically may not be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred
	for a specified period of time following the vesting date. The transfer restriction period typically lasts for (1) one year with respect to one-half of the units vesting on the service-based
	vesting date and (2) two years with respect to the other one-half of the units vesting on such service-based vesting date. Transfer restricted common units become saleable at the end of the
	transfer restriction period if the holder has not been terminated for cause and has not breached in any significant or intentional manner, as determined by the Administrator, the terms of his or her
	confidentiality and restrictive covenants contained in the grant agreement during the transfer restriction period. See "Terms of Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Agreements" below.




	        While
	employed by our firm, our principals, including our named executive officers, may also be subject to a minimum retained ownership requirement under the restricted equity unit grant
	agreement, which would obligate them to continuously hold common unit equivalents of 15% of their cumulatively vested restricted equity units, unless waived. From time to time, the transfer
	restrictions and minimum retained ownership requirements applicable to restricted equity units of certain principles, including our named executive officers, may be transferred to such principals' KKR
	Holdings units so that the total units of equity subject to transfer restrictions and minimum retained ownership requirements are expected to be the same, unless waived.

	Table of Contents





	        For additional information about equity awards granted under our Equity Incentive Plan, please also see "KKR & Co. L.P. Equity Incentive
	Plan" below.






	Terms of Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Agreements






	        The confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements with each of our named executive officers include prohibitions on them
	competing with us or soliciting certain fund investors or senior-level employees of our firm and specified subsidiaries and affiliates during a restricted period following their departure from the
	firm. These agreements also require personnel to protect and use the firm's confidential information only in accordance with confidentiality restrictions set forth in the agreement.




	        The
	restricted periods for our Co-Chief Executive Officers expire on (1) for voluntary terminations or terminations with cause, two years from termination and (2) for
	terminations without cause, one year from termination. The restricted periods for our other named executive officers expire on (1) for voluntary terminations or terminations with cause,
	18 months from termination, and (2) for terminations
	without cause, nine months from termination. These restricted periods are subject to reduction for any "garden leave" or "notice period" that an employee serves prior to termination of employment.




	        Our
	named executive officers other than our Co-Chief Executive Officers have entered into these confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements with us through their restricted
	equity unit grant agreements and separately also with KKR Holdings, which is entitled to waive, modify or amend them at any time without our consent. However, because our Co-Chief Executive Officers
	have not received any restricted equity units, their confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements are solely with KKR Holdings. Because KKR Holdings is the party to these agreements and not us,
	we may not be able to enforce them, and these agreements might be waived, modified or amended at any time without our consent.

	The

	These
	amounts are based on the closing market price of our common units on each respective vesting date.







	Pension Benefits for 2013





	        We provided no pension benefits during the year ended December 31, 2013.





	Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for 2013





	        We provided no defined contribution plan for the deferral of compensation on a basis that is not tax-qualified during the year ended
	December 31, 2013.





	Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control





	        Upon termination of employment, vesting generally ceases for KKR Holdings units and restricted equity units that have not initially
	vested. In addition, transfer restricted vested KKR Holdings units and, if applicable, transfer restricted equity units (which term includes the transfer restricted common




	274











	Table of Contents





	units
	that may be delivered upon settlement of such restricted equity units) remain subject to transfer restrictions for one- and two-year periods, except as described below.




	        A
	principal who retires after the first date on which his or her age plus years of service to KKR equals 80 will continue to vest in his or her unvested KKR Holdings units and restricted
	equity units for an additional two years following retirement, subject to compliance, if applicable, with the requirement that the holder not violate the terms and conditions of his or her
	confidentiality and restrictive covenants during the period in which such KKR Holdings unit or, if applicable, restricted equity unit, remains transfer restricted over one- and two-year periods. None
	of our named executive officers retired in the year ended December 31, 2013.




	        Upon
	death or permanent disability, a holder of KKR Holdings units or restricted equity units becomes immediately vested in all unvested KKR Holdings units and restricted equity units,
	and the transfer restrictions, if any, immediately lapse. The values of unvested KKR Holdings units and restricted equity units held by the named executive officers as of December 31, 2013 are
	set forth above in the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2013 Fiscal Year-End Table.




	        In
	addition, upon a change in control of KKR, a holder of KKR Holdings units and restricted equity units becomes immediately vested in all unvested KKR Holdings units and restricted
	equity units, and the transfer restrictions, if any, immediately lapse. As noted above, the values of unvested KKR Holdings units and restricted equity units held by the named executive officers as of
	December 31, 2013 are set forth above in the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2013 Fiscal Year-End Table.




	        Upon
	termination of employment, vesting generally ceases for carried interest allocations, except that for allocations made for investments in 2012 and in prior years only, the vesting
	of carried interest allocations of our named executive officers and other principals may continue for a certain pre-determined period of time if they are terminated without cause or if they leave
	without cause, subject to compliance, if applicable, with the requirement that the person not violate the terms and conditions of his or her confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreement. In
	addition, carried interest allocations become immediately vested upon death or permanent disability.





	Director Compensation





	        We limit compensation for service on our Managing Partner's board of directors to the independent directors. Each independent director
	receives (1) an annual cash retainer of $75,000, (2) an additional annual cash retainer of $15,000 if such independent director is a member of the nominating and corporate governance
	committee, (3) an additional annual cash retainer of $25,000 if such independent director is a member of the audit committee and (4) an additional annual cash retainer of $15,000 if such
	independent director serves as the chairman of the audit committee. Cash retainers are pro rated if, during the calendar year, a director joins the board of directors of our Managing Partner or a
	director joins or resigns from a committee. In addition, on July 29, 2013, 7,222 restricted equity units were approved for grant to each independent director pursuant to our Equity

	column represents the grant date fair value of restricted equity units granted to each of the independent directors during the year ended
	December 31, 2013 as calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 718. These amounts reflect the aggregate grant date fair values calculated under ASC Topic 718 and may not correspond to the actual
	value that will be recognized by the independent directors.







	KKR & Co. L.P. Equity Incentive Plan





	        Our Managing Partner has adopted the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, which is referred to as the Equity
	Incentive Plan.




	276











	Table of Contents







	Administration






	        The board of directors of our Managing Partner administers the Equity Incentive Plan. However, the board of directors of our Managing
	Partner may delegate such authority, including to a committee or subcommittee of the board of directors. Under the terms of the Equity Incentive Plan, the board of directors of our Managing Partner,
	or the committee or subcommittee thereof to whom authority to administer the Equity Incentive Plan has been delegated, as the case may be, is referred to as the Administrator. The Administrator
	determines who will receive awards under the Equity Incentive Plan, as well as the form of the awards, the number of units underlying the awards and the terms and conditions of the awards, consistent
	with the terms of the Equity Incentive Plan. The Administrator has full authority to interpret and administer the Equity Incentive Plan and its determinations will be final and binding on all parties
	concerned. The Administrator may delegate the authority to grant awards and the day-to-day administration of the plan to any of our employees. Grants of equity awards to our named executive officers
	under our Equity Incentive Plan are made only by our Managing Partner's board of directors.






	Common Units Subject to the Equity Incentive Plan






	        The total number of our common units that may be issued under the Equity Incentive Plan as of the effective date of the plan was
	equivalent to 15% of the number of fully diluted and exchanged common units outstanding as of such date; provided that beginning with the first fiscal year after the Equity Incentive Plan became
	effective and continuing with each subsequent fiscal year occurring thereafter, the aggregate number of common units covered by the plan will be increased, on the first day of each fiscal year of
	KKR & Co. L.P. occurring during the term of the plan, by a number of common units equal to the positive difference, if any, of (x) 15% of the aggregate number of common
	units outstanding (on a fully-diluted and exchanged basis) on the last day of the immediately
	preceding fiscal year minus (y) the aggregate number of common units available for issuance under the plan as of the last day of such year, unless the Administrator should decide to increase
	the number of common units covered by the plan by a lesser amount on any such date.






	Options and Unit Appreciation Rights






	        The Administrator may award non-qualified unit options and unit appreciation rights under the Equity Incentive Plan. Options and unit
	appreciation rights granted under the Equity Incentive Plan will become vested and exercisable at such times and upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Administrator at the time of
	grant, but no option or unit appreciation right will be exercisable for a period of more than 10 years after it is granted. The exercise price per common unit will be determined by the
	Administrator, provided that options and unit appreciation rights granted to participants who are U.S. taxpayers (i) will not be granted with an exercise price less than 100% of the fair market
	value per underlying common unit on the date of grant and (ii) will not be granted unless the common unit on which it is granted constitutes equity of the participant's "service recipient"
	within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To the extent permitted by the Administrator, the exercise price of an option may be paid in cash or its
	equivalent, in common units having a fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Administrator, partly in cash and partly in
	common units or through net settlement in common units. As determined by the Administrator, unit appreciation rights may be settled in common units, cash or any combination thereof.






	Other Equity-Based Awards






	        The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may grant or sell common units, restricted common units, deferred restricted common units,
	phantom restricted common units, and any other awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on the fair market value of, the




	277











	Table of Contents





	common
	units, including restricted equity units that may be granted from time to time, to our principals, including our named executive officers. Any of these other equity-based awards may be in such
	form, and dependent on such conditions, as the Administrator determines, including without limitation the right to receive, or vest with respect to, one or more common units (or the equivalent
	cash value of such units) upon the completion of a specified period of service, the occurrence of an event and/or the attainment of performance objectives. The Administrator may, in its discretion,
	determine whether other equity-based awards will be payable in cash, common units or other assets or a combination of cash, common units and other assets.





	Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation





	        Because we are a limited partnership, our Managing Partner's board of directors is not required by NYSE rules to establish a
	compensation committee. Our founders, Messrs. Kravis and Roberts, serve as Co-Chairmen of the board of directors of our Managing Partner and participated in discussions regarding executive
	compensation. For a description of certain transactions between us and our founders, see "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence."





	Compensation Committee Report





	        The board of directors of our Managing Partner does not have a compensation committee. The entire board of directors has reviewed and
	discussed with management the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis and, based on such review and discussion, has determined that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis should be included
	in this annual report.

	ITEM 12.    SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS







	Our Common Units





	        The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of our common units and KKR Group Partnership Units that are exchangeable for
	our common units by:






	




	each person known to us to beneficially own more than 5% of any class of the outstanding voting securities of our
	partnership based on our review of filings with the SEC;








	




	each of the directors, persons chosen to become a director and named executive officers of our Managing Partner; and








	




	the directors, persons chosen to become a director and executive officers of our Managing Partner as a group.






	        The
	numbers of common units and KKR Group Partnership Units outstanding and the percentage of beneficial ownership are based on 288,143,327 common units issued and outstanding and
	404,369,018 KKR Group Partnership Units that are exchangeable for our common units as of February 18, 2014. Beneficial ownership is in each case determined in accordance with the rules of the
	SEC, and includes equity securities of which that person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days of February 18, 2014. Under these rules, more than one person may be
	deemed a beneficial owner of the same securities and a person may be deemed a beneficial owner of securities as to which he has no economic interest.

	beneficial ownership of the securities.

	The
	common units above consist solely of common units that will vest to Messrs. Fisher, Janetschek and Sorkin, respectively, within 60 days of
	February 14, 2014. The reported KKR Group Partnership Units include 27,098, 7,255 and 7,955 units that will vest to Messrs. Fisher, Janetschek and Sorkin, respectively, within
	60 days of February 14, 2014. These KKR Group Partnership Units are held through KKR Holdings.







	Our Managing Partner





	        Our Managing Partner's outstanding limited liability company interests consist of Class A shares, which are entitled to vote on
	the election and removal of directors and all other matters that have not been delegated to the board of directors or reserved for the vote of Class B members, and Class B shares, which
	are entitled to vote only with respect to any matter requiring the approval of holders of voting interests held directly or indirectly by us in the general partners of our non-U.S. funds.
	Notwithstanding the number of Class A shares held by the Class A members, under our Managing Partner's limited liability company agreement, Messrs. Kravis and Roberts, as the
	designated members of KKR Management LLC, are deemed to represent a majority of the Class A shares outstanding when acting together for purposes of voting on matters upon which holders
	of Class A shares are entitled to vote. Messrs. Kravis and Roberts may, in their discretion, designate one or more holders of Class A shares to hold such voting power and exercise
	all of the rights and duties of Messrs. Kravis and Roberts under our Managing Partner's limited liability company agreement. While Messrs. Kravis and Roberts historically have acted with
	unanimity when managing our business, they have not entered into any agreement relating to the voting of their Class A shares. All of our Managing Partner's other Class A shares are held
	by our other senior principals. Our Managing Partner's Class B shares are divided equally among twelve principals, each of whom holds less than 10% of the voting power of the Class B
	shares. None of the shares in our Managing Partner provide these holders with economic interests in our business. See also "Risk FactorsOur limited partnership agreement contains
	provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) of our limited partner and limit remedies available for unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of
	duty. It will be difficult for unitholders to successfully challenge a resolution of a conflict of interest by our Managing Partner or by its conflicts committee." In addition, see "Risk
	FactorsWe are a Delaware limited partnership, and there are provisions in our limited partnership agreement regarding exculpation and indemnification of our officers and directors that
	differ from the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) in a manner that may be less protective of the interests of our common unitholders."

	The
	aggregate number of common units covered by the Equity Incentive Plan is increased on the first day of each fiscal year during its term by a number of
	units equal to the positive difference, if any, of (a) 15% of the aggregate number of common units outstanding (on a fully-diluted basis) on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal
	year minus (b) the aggregate number of common units available for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan as of such date (unless the Administrator of the Equity Incentive Plan should decide
	to increase the number of common units covered by the plan by a lesser amount). We have filed a registration statement and intend to file additional registration statements on Form S-8 under
	the Securities Act to register common units covered by the Equity Incentive Plan (including pursuant to automatic annual increases). Any such Form S-8 registration statement will automatically
	become effective upon filing. Accordingly, common units registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market.

	ITEM 13.    CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE






	        The following description is a summary of the material terms of the agreements described below, and does not contain all of the
	information that you may find useful. For additional information, you should read the copies of our investment agreement, our exchange agreement, our registration rights agreement, our tax receivable
	agreement and the partnership agreements of the KKR Group Partnerships, all of which have been filed as exhibits to this report.





	The Investment Agreement





	        On August 4, 2009, we entered into an investment agreement by and among us, certain of our affiliates, KPE and certain of its
	affiliates, as a condition to the KPE Transaction.






	U.S. Listing






	        The investment agreement provided that we and KPE each had the right to require that the other use its reasonable best efforts to cause
	KPE to contribute its units representing limited partner interests in KKR Group Holdings L.P. to us in exchange for an equivalent number of our common units and, in connection therewith, our
	common units received by KPE to be listed and traded on the NYSE by delivering an election notice to the other party. On February 24, 2010, we delivered an election notice to KPE pursuant to
	the investment agreement, and we commenced trading on the NYSE on July 15, 2010 under the symbol "KKR".






	Indemnification and Insurance






	        The investment agreement provides that, for a period of six years after the closing of the NYSE listing on July 15, 2010, the
	KKR Group Partnerships will indemnify each present and former director and officer of the general partner of KPE and certain other persons serving in a similar role against all losses, liabilities,
	damages, judgments and fines incurred in connection with any suit, claim, action, proceeding, arbitration or investigation arising out of or related to actions taken by them in their capacity as
	directors or officers of the general partner of KPE or taken by them at the request of KPE or the general partner of KPE. In addition, the investment agreement also provides that the KKR Group
	Partnerships will indemnify us, KPE, each present and former director and officer of the general partner of KPE and certain other persons serving a similar role against all losses, liabilities,
	damages, judgments and fines to which any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other applicable law, statute, rule or regulation insofar as such losses,
	liabilities, damages, judgments and fines arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement relating to our
	common units to be issued to, and distributed by KPE or any other document issued by us, KPE or any of their respective affiliates in connection with, or otherwise relating to, our NYSE listing, or
	arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
	circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.




	        Pursuant
	to the investment agreement, we obtained directors' and officers' liability insurance for the benefit of the directors and officers (and former directors and officers) of the
	general partner of KPE which (i) is effective for a period from the date of the dissolution of KPE through and including the date that is six years after such date, (ii) covers claims
	arising out of or relating to any action, statement or omission of such directors and officers whether on or before the date of such dissolution (including the transactions contemplated by the
	investment agreement and the decision making process by the directors of the general partner of KPE in connection therewith) to the same extent as the directors and officers of our Managing Partner
	acting in their capacities as the directors and officers of




	284











	Table of Contents





	the
	general partner of KPE are insured with respect thereto, and (iii) contains a coverage limit of $100 million.





	Exchange Agreement





	        We have entered into an exchange agreement with KKR Holdings, the entity through which certain of our principals, including
	Messrs. Kravis, Roberts, Fisher, Janetschek and Sorkin, hold their KKR Group Partnership Units, pursuant to which KKR Holdings or certain transferees of its KKR Group Partnership Units may, on
	a quarterly basis (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), exchange KKR Group Partnership Units held by them (together with corresponding special voting units) for our common units on a
	one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. At the election of certain of our intermediate holding companies that are
	partners of the KKR Group Partnerships, the intermediate holding companies may settle exchanges of KKR Group Partnership Units with cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of the common units
	that would otherwise be deliverable in such exchanges. To the extent that KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR Holdings or its transferees are exchanged for our common units, our interests in the
	KKR Group Partnerships will be correspondingly increased. Any common units received upon such exchange will be subject to any restrictions that were applicable to the exchanged KKR Group Partnership
	Units, including any applicable transfer restrictions. During the year ended December 31, 2013, 28,184,258 KKR Group Partnership Units were exchanged for our common units pursuant to this
	agreement.




	        On
	November 2, 2010, the exchange agreement was amended and restated to provide certain rights to cancel exchanges or limit the number of units exchanged in a given quarter. The
	amendments also provided that certain exchanges will be with a new subsidiary, the result of which is that the income tax character of a small portion of income distributed to unitholders may differ
	from what it would have been absent the amendment. If additional taxes result from the inclusion of this subsidiary of ours, KKR Holdings will make payments to one of our subsidiaries in respect of
	those taxes.




	        Certain
	interests in KKR Holdings that are held by our principals are subject to transfer restrictions and vesting requirements that, unless waived, modified or amended limit the ability
	of our principals to cause KKR Group Partnership Units to be exchanged under the exchange agreement so long as applicable vesting and transfer restrictions apply. The general partner of KKR Holdings,
	which is controlled by our founders, will have sole authority for waiving any applicable vesting or transfer restrictions.




	        As
	contemplated by the exchange agreement, a coordinated selling program has been established relating to sales of common units received pursuant to the exchanges by holders of KKR
	Holdings units. Pursuant to the program, sales generally take place quarterly, and management is permitted to establish an overall limit on such sales based upon the trading volume of our common units
	or any other factor that may be considered relevant.





	Registration Rights Agreement





	        In connection with our NYSE listing, we entered into a registration rights agreement with KKR Holdings pursuant to which we granted KKR
	Holdings, its affiliates and transferees of its KKR Group Partnership Units the right, under certain circumstances and subject to certain restrictions, to require us to register under the Securities
	Act our common units (and other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common units) held or acquired by them. Under the registration rights agreement, holders of
	registration rights will have the right to request us to register the common units received upon the exchange of their KKR Holdings units and the sale of such common units and also have the right to
	require us to make available shelf registration statements permitting sales of common units into the market from time to time over an extended period. In addition, holders of




	285











	Table of Contents





	registration
	rights will have the ability to exercise certain piggyback registration rights in connection with registered offerings requested by other holders of registration rights or initiated by
	us. On October 1, 2010, the registration statement we filed pursuant to this agreement was declared effective, and a post-effective amendment was declared effective on September 21,
	2011. As of December 31, 2013, 404,369,018 common units remain unissued under that registration statement.





	Tax Receivable Agreement





	        We and one or more of our intermediate holding companies may be required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time
	pursuant to our exchange agreement with KKR Holdings. KKR Management Holdings L.P. has made and in the future intends to continue to make an election under Section 754 of the Internal
	Revenue Code in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units for common units occurs. Certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in certain of
	our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our
	business, that would not otherwise have been available. This increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce the amount of income tax
	our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future. This increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital
	assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.




	        We
	have entered into a tax receivable agreement with KKR Holdings requiring the intermediate holding company to pay to KKR Holdings or transferees of its KKR Group Partnership Units 85%
	of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies actually realize as a result of this increase in tax basis, as well as 85% of
	the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies actually realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. A termination of the
	agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events. This payment obligation is an obligation of
	the intermediate holding companies and not of either KKR Group Partnership. As such, the cash distributions to common unitholders may vary from holders of KKR Group Partnership Units (held by KKR
	Holdings and others) to the extent payments are made under the tax receivable agreements to exchanging holders of KKR Group Partnership Units. As the payments reflect actual tax savings received by
	KKR entities, there may be a timing difference between the tax savings received by KKR entities and the cash payments to exchanging holders of KKR Group Partnership Units. We expect the intermediate
	holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that it realizes. In the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as
	corporations and acquire KKR Group Partnership Units in the future, or if we become taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect that each will become subject to a tax
	receivable agreement with substantially similar terms.




	        For
	purposes of the tax receivable agreement, cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of our subsidiary to the amount of such taxes that
	the intermediate holding companies would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships as a result of the
	exchanges of KKR Group Partnership Units and had the intermediate holding companies not entered into the tax receivable agreement. The term of the tax receivable agreement continues until all such tax
	benefits have been utilized or expired, unless the intermediate holding companies exercise their right to terminate the tax receivable agreement for an amount based on the agreed payments remaining to
	be made under the agreement.




	        Estimating
	the amount of payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of
	factors. The




	286











	Table of Contents





	actual
	increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors,
	including:






	




	the timing of exchangesfor instance, the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair
	market value, which may fluctuate over time, of the KKR Group Partnership Units, which will depend on the fair market value of the depreciable or amortizable assets of the KKR Group Partnerships at
	the time of the transaction;








	




	the price of our common units at the time of the exchangethe increase in any tax deductions, as well as the
	tax basis increase in other assets, of the KKR Group Partnerships, is directly proportional to the price of our common units at the time of the exchange;








	




	the extent to which such exchanges are taxableif an exchange is not taxable for any reason (for instance, in
	the case of a charitable contribution), increased deductions will not be available; and








	




	the amount of tax, if any, our intermediate holding company is required to pay aside from any tax benefit from the
	exchanges, and the timing of any such payment. If our intermediate holding companies do not have taxable income aside from any tax benefit from the exchanges, it will not be required to make payments
	under the tax receivable agreement for that taxable year because no tax savings will have been actually realized.






	        We
	expect that as a result of the amount of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnerships, assuming no material changes in the
	relevant tax law and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization of our
	assets, future payments under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon our principals' continued ownership of us and
	are required to be made within 90 days of the filing of the tax return of KKR Management Holdings Corp. For the year ended December 31, 2013 such payments made to our principals, none of
	whom included a member of the board of directors of our Managing Partner, were approximately $3.7 million. Such payments to KKR Holdings were $1 million and a de minimis amount was paid
	to Messrs. Fisher and Janetschek.




	        The
	intermediate holding companies may terminate the tax receivable agreement at any time by making an early termination payment to KKR Holdings or its transferees, based upon the net
	present value (based upon certain assumptions in the tax receivable agreement) of all tax benefits that would be required to be paid by the intermediate holding companies to KKR Holdings or its
	transferees. In addition, the tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of combination transactions or other changes of control, the minimum obligations of
	our intermediate holding companies or their successor with respect to exchanged or acquired KKR Group Partnership Units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction) would be based
	on certain assumptions, including that our intermediate holding companies would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the increased tax deductions and increased tax basis and other benefits
	related to entering into the tax receivable agreement. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity.




	        Decisions
	made by our senior principals in the course of running our business, such as with respect to mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of
	control, may influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by an exchanging or selling holder of partner interests in the KKR Group Partnerships under the tax receivable agreement. For
	example, the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction will generally accelerate payments under the tax receivable agreement and increase the present value of such
	payments, and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction will increase a principals' tax liability without giving rise to any rights of a principal to receive payments
	under the tax receivable agreement.




	287











	Table of Contents





	        Payments
	under the tax receivable agreement will be based upon the tax reporting positions that our Managing Partner will determine. We are not aware of any issue that would cause the
	IRS to challenge a tax basis increase. However, neither KKR Holdings nor its transferees will reimburse us for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if such tax basis
	increase, or the tax benefits we claim arising from such increase, is successfully challenged by the IRS. As a result, in certain circumstances payments to KKR Holdings or its transferees under the
	tax receivable agreement could be in excess of the intermediate holding company's cash tax savings. The intermediate holding company's ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the
	payments to be made under this agreement, will depend upon a number of factors, as discussed above, including the timing and amount of our future income.





	KKR Group Partnership Agreements





	        We indirectly control the general partners of the KKR Group Partnerships and, through the KKR Group Partnerships and their
	subsidiaries, the KKR business. Because our Managing Partner operates and controls us, our Managing Partner's board of directors and our officers are ultimately responsible for all material decisions
	of the KKR Group Partnerships and the KKR Group Partnerships' businesses.




	        Pursuant
	to the partnership agreements of the KKR Group Partnerships, our partnership, as the controlling general partner of KKR Fund Holdings L.P. and KKR Management
	Holdings L.P., have the indirect right to determine when distributions will be made to the holders of KKR Group Partnership Units and the amount of any such distributions.




	        The
	partnership agreements of the KKR Group Partnerships provide for tax distributions to the holders of KKR Group Partnership Units if the general partners of the KKR Group Partnerships
	determine that distributions from the KKR Group Partnerships would otherwise be insufficient to cover the tax liabilities of a holder of a KKR Group Partnership Unit. Generally, these tax
	distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the net taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a holder of a KKR Group Partnership Unit multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal
	to the highest effective marginal combined U.S. federal, state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in New York, New York (taking into account the
	nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income).




	        The
	partnership agreements of the KKR Group Partnerships authorize the general partners of the KKR Group Partnerships to issue an unlimited number of additional securities of the KKR
	Group Partnerships with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to the KKR Group Partnerships Units, and which may be
	exchangeable for KKR Group Partnership Units.





	Firm Use of Private Aircraft





	        Certain of our senior principals, including Messrs. Kravis and Roberts, own aircraft that we use for business purposes in the
	ordinary course of our operations. These senior principals paid for the purchase of these aircraft with their personal funds and bear all operating, personnel and maintenance costs associated with
	their operation. The hourly rates that we pay for the use of these aircraft are based on current market rates for chartering private aircraft of the same type.
	We paid $4.8 million for the use of these aircraft during the year ended December 31, 2013, of which $4.5 million was paid to entities collectively controlled by
	Messrs. Kravis and Roberts.





	Side-By-Side and Other Investments





	        Because fund investors typically are unwilling to invest their capital in a fund unless the fund's manager also invests its own capital
	in the fund's investments, our investment fund documents generally require the general partners of our investment funds to make minimum capital commitments to the




	288











	Table of Contents





	funds.
	The amount of these commitments, which are negotiated by fund investors, generally range from 2% to 4% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain
	funds pursuing new strategies. When investments are made, the general partner contributes capital to the fund based on its fund commitment percentage and if applicable, acquires a capital interest in
	the investment that is not subject to a carried interest. Historically, these capital contributions have been funded with cash from operations that otherwise would be distributed to our principals and
	by our principals.




	        In
	connection with the KPE Transaction, we did not acquire capital interests in investments that were funded by our principals or others involved in our business prior to
	October 1, 2009. Rather, those capital interests were allocated to our principals or others involved in our business and are reflected in our financial statements as noncontrolling interests in
	consolidated entities to the extent that we hold the general partner interest in the fund. Any capital contributions that our private equity fund general partners are required to make to a fund will
	be funded by us and we will be entitled to receive our allocable share of the returns thereon.




	        In
	addition, our principals and certain other qualifying employees are permitted to invest and have invested their own capital in side-by-side investments with our funds. Side-by-side
	investments are investments made on the same terms and conditions as those available to the applicable fund, except that these side-by-side investments are not subject to management fees or a carried
	interest. The cash invested by our executive officers and their investment vehicles aggregated to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, of which $34 million,
	$29 million, $6 million, $3 million and $1 million was invested by Messrs. Kravis, Roberts, Fisher, Janetschek, and Sorkin respectively. These investments are not
	included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In addition, our funds invested $6.4 million in 2013 from the commitments of certain investment vehicles associated with
	Mr. Hess. Such
	investments associated with Mr. Hess were made on the same terms and conditions as for other fund investors including management fees and/or a carried interest applicable to the relevant fund.





	Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Others





	        Under our partnership agreement, in most circumstances we will indemnify the following persons, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
	from and against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts: our
	Managing Partner; any departing Managing Partner; any person who is or was an affiliate of our Managing Partner or any departing Managing Partner; any person who is or was a member, partner, tax
	matters partner, officer, director, employee, agent, fiduciary or trustee of our partnership or our subsidiaries, the general partner or any departing general partner or any affiliate of us or our
	subsidiaries, our Managing Partner or any departing Managing Partner; any person who is or was serving at the request of a Managing Partner or any departing Managing Partner or any affiliate of a
	Managing Partner or any departing Managing Partner as an officer, director, employee, member, partner, agent, fiduciary or trustee of another person; or any person designated by our Managing Partner.
	We have agreed to provide this indemnification unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that these persons acted in bad faith or
	engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. We have also agreed to provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings. Any indemnification under these provisions will only be out of our assets. Unless
	it otherwise agrees, our Managing Partner will not be personally liable for, or have any obligation to contribute or loan funds or assets to us to enable us to effectuate, indemnification. The
	indemnification of the persons described above shall be secondary to any indemnification such person is entitled from another person or the relevant KKR fund to the extent applicable. We may purchase
	insurance against liabilities asserted against and expenses incurred by persons in connection with our activities, regardless of whether we would have the power to indemnify the person against
	liabilities under our partnership agreement.

	        Each
	member of the board of directors (each an "Indemnitee") has entered into an indemnification agreement with the Managing Partner and us. Each indemnification agreement provides that
	the Indemnitee, subject to the limitations set forth in each indemnification agreement, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Managing Partner on an after tax basis from and against any and
	all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts arising from any and all
	threatened, pending or completed claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal and including appeals, in
	which the Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of being or having been or having agreed to serve as a member of the board of directors, or
	while serving as a member of the board of directors, being or having been serving or having agreed to serve at the request of the
	Managing Partner as a director, officer, employee or agent (which, for purposes hereof, shall include a trustee, partner or manager or similar capacity) of another corporation, limited liability
	company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring on, before or after the date of such indemnification
	agreement. Each indemnification agreement provides that the Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless if there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by an arbitral tribunal
	or court of competent jurisdiction determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to the indemnification agreement, the Indemnitee acted in bad
	faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct.





	Guarantee of Contingent Obligations to Fund Partners; Indemnification





	        The partnership documents governing KKR's carrypaying funds, including funds relating to private equity, mezzanine,
	infrastructure, energy, direct lending and special situations investments, generally include a "clawback" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general
	partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. Under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a fund, the general partner is
	required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry
	distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, including the effects of any performance thresholds.
	Excluding carried interest received by the general partners of funds that were not contributed to KKR in the KPE Transaction, as of December 31, 2013, no carried interest was subject to this
	clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry paying funds were liquidated at their December 31, 2013 fair values. Had the investments in such funds been liquidated at zero value, the
	clawback obligation would have been $1,350.7 million. Carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the
	fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. Amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are
	earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. If these investment amounts
	earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner
	during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. For funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation,
	if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. For funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is
	reflected as a reduction of KKR's investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded.




	        Certain
	private equity funds that were contributed to KKR in the KPE Transaction also include a "net loss sharing provision." Upon the liquidation of an investment vehicle to which a net
	loss sharing




	290











	Table of Contents





	obligation
	applies, the general partner is required to contribute capital to the vehicle, to fund 20% of the net losses on investments. In these vehicles, such losses would be required to be paid by
	KKR to the fund investors in those vehicles in the event of a liquidation of the fund regardless of whether any carried interest had previously been distributed, and a greater share of investment
	losses would be allocable to KKR relative to the capital that KKR contributed to it as general partner. Based on the fair market values as of December 31, 2013, there would have been no net
	loss sharing obligation. If the vehicles were liquidated at zero value, the net loss sharing obligation would have been approximately $496.4 million as of December 31, 2013.




	        Prior
	to the KPE Transaction, certain KKR principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to KKR had personally
	guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general
	partners' clawback obligations. The terms of the KPE Transaction require that KKR principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the KPE
	Transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. Through investment realizations, this amount has been reduced to $217.8 million as of December 31, 2013. Using valuations as of
	December 31, 2013, no amounts are due with respect to the clawback obligation required to be funded by KKR principals. Carry distributions arising subsequent to the KPE Transaction may give
	rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to KKR and KKR's principals who participate in the carry pool. Unlike the clawback obligation, KKR will be responsible for amounts due
	under a net loss sharing obligation and will indemnify KKR's principals for any personal guarantees that they have provided with respect to such amounts. In addition, guarantees of or similar
	arrangements relating to clawback or net loss sharing obligations in favor of third party investors in an individual investment partnership by entities KKR owns may limit distributions of carried
	interest more generally.





	Facilities





	        Certain trusts, whose beneficiaries include children of Mr. Kravis and Mr. Roberts, and certain other senior principals
	who are not executive officers of the Company, are partners in a real-estate based partnership that maintains an ownership interest in our Menlo Park location. Payments made from us to this
	partnership aggregated $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, Mr. Kravis is a part owner of a limited liability company which occupies office space leased
	by a subsidiary of ours and which made payments to us of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.





	Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Agreements





	        Our principals have entered into confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements that include prohibitions on our principals
	competing with us or soliciting certain fund investors or senior-level employees of our firm and specified subsidiaries and affiliates during a restricted period following their departure from the
	firm. For further information on these agreements, see "Executive CompensationNarrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2013Terms
	of Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Agreements."





	Transactions with other Related Persons





	        We have and may in the future continue to enter into ordinary course transactions with unaffiliated entities known to us to
	beneficially own more than 5% of any class of the outstanding voting securities of our partnership. These transactions may include investments by them in our funds generally on the same terms and
	conditions offered to other unaffiliated fund investors and participation in our capital markets transactions, including underwritings and syndications, generally on

	the
	same terms and conditions offered to other unaffiliated capital markets participants. See "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters."





	Statement of Policy Regarding Transactions with Related Persons





	        The board of directors of our Managing Partner adopted a written statement of policy for our partnership regarding transactions with
	related persons, which we refer to as our related person policy. Our related person policy requires that a "related person" (as defined as in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K) must promptly
	disclose to our General Counsel or other designated person any "related person transaction" (defined as any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or series of similar transactions, arrangements or
	relationships, including, without limitation, any loan, guarantee of indebtedness, transfer or lease of real estate, or use of company property) that is
	reportable by us under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had or will have
	a direct or indirect material interest) and all material facts with respect thereto. Those individuals will then communicate that information to the board of directors of our Managing Partner. No
	related person transaction will be consummated without the approval or ratification of a committee of the board consisting exclusively of disinterested directors; provided, however, the conflicts
	committee of our board of directors has pre-approved certain ordinary course transactions with persons known to us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding common units on terms generally
	not less favorable as obtained from other third parties, including investments in our funds as limited partners and participation in capital markets transactions like underwritings and syndications.
	It is our policy that directors interested in a related person transaction will recuse themselves from any vote on a related person transaction in which they have an interest. All transactions entered
	into prior to July 14, 2010 were not approved in accordance with this policy as they were entered into prior to the date of adoption of the policy. All side-by-side and other investments
	described in this section are pre-approved in accordance with the terms of the policy.

	ARTICLE II





	REGISTRATION RIGHTS




	 




	Section 2.1


	                                   



	Shelf Registration Statement



	.




	 




	(a)


	                                


	The Partnership shall file with the SEC reasonably promptly following the date hereof (and in any event within 10 Business Days thereafter) one or more shelf registration statements covering the resale of such Registrable Securities for offerings to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act (the 

	Shelf Registration Statement

	).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partnership shall be entitled to postpone the filing of a Shelf Registration Statement to the same extent that it is entitled to prohibit sales of Registrable Securities under an effective Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.2(e) below.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	The Partnership shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act by the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(a), and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continually effective until all the Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement cease to constitute Registrable Securities.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Partnerships obligation to any particular Covered Person to use all commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement effective shall cease upon such time as the Common Units delivered to such Covered Person pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement cease to constitute Registrable Securities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partnership shall be entitled to postpone causing any Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective to the same extent that it is entitled to prohibit sales of Registrable Securities under an effective Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.2(e) below.




	 




	4














	 




	(c)


	                                 


	The Partnership shall be liable for and pay all Registration Expenses in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement, regardless of whether such registration is effected.




	 




	Section 2.2


	                                   



	Registration Procedures



	.  At such time as the Partnership is obligated under this Article II to use all commercially reasonable efforts to effect and maintain a Shelf Registration Statement on behalf of Covered Persons, then:




	 




	(a)


	                                


	At least five Trading Days prior to the initial filing, and two Trading Days prior to each subsequent filing, with the SEC of any registration statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Partnership shall furnish to each Registering Covered Person copies of such registration statement as proposed to be filed, including each amendment and supplement thereto, and thereafter the Partnership shall furnish to such Registering Covered Person such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein), the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary prospectus) and such other documents as such Registering Covered Person may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Registering Covered Person.  The Registering Covered Person shall have the right to request that the Partnership modify any information contained in such registration statement, amendment and supplement thereto pertaining to such Registering Covered Person and the Partnership shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to comply with each such request, provided, however, that the Partnership shall not have any obligation to so modify any information if the Partnership reasonably expects that so doing would cause the prospectus to contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall notify such Registering Covered Person of its determination.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	After the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement, the Partnership shall (i) cause the related prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and, as so supplemented, to be filed pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of Rule 424 under the Securities Act, (ii) comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the Registering Covered Persons thereof set forth in such registration statement or supplement to such prospectus and (iii) promptly notify each Registering Covered Person holding Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement of any stop order issued or threatened by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement or any state securities commission and take all commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of such stop order or to obtain the withdrawal of such order if entered as soon as practicable thereafter.




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	Upon a Founder


	


	s request (and in no event more than two times in any 12-month period), the Partnership agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to file a prospectus supplement reasonably promptly after such request adding pledgees of the Founder


	


	s KKR Units as selling shareholders on such Shelf Registration Statement. After the expiration of the restrictions on transfer relating to any securities received by such persons pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement and imposed on any Management Seller or any Key Employee




	 




	5














	 




	Seller pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement or the Organizational Documents of any issuer thereof, upon such Management Seller


	


	s or such Key Employee Seller


	


	s request (and in no event more than two times in any 12-month period), the Partnership agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to file a prospectus supplement reasonably promptly after such request adding pledgees of the Management Seller


	


	s or the Key Employee Seller


	


	s (as the case may be) KKR Units as selling shareholders on such Shelf Registration Statement.




	 




	(d)


	                                


	The Partnership shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the United States any Registering Covered Person holding such Registrable Securities reasonably (in light of the intended plan of distribution) requests and (ii) cause such Registrable Securities to be registered with or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the Partnership and do any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such Registering Covered Person to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such person, provided that the Partnership shall not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 2.2(d), (B) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (C) consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction.




	 




	(e)


	                                 


	The Partnership shall immediately notify each Registering Covered Person holding such Registrable Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the occurrence of an event requiring the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and promptly prepare and make available to each such Registering Covered Person and file with the SEC any such supplement or amendment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of Section 2.1(b), upon notice to each Covered Person whose Registrable Securities are covered by any Shelf Registration Statement, the Partnership shall be entitled to prohibit sales of Registrable Securities under such Shelf Registration Statement by each such Covered Person on up to three occasions during any period of six consecutive months for a reasonable time specified in the notice but not exceeding 120 days in the aggregate (which periods may not be extended or renewed), if (i) the Managing Partner shall determine in good faith that effecting such sales would materially and adversely affect an offering of securities of the Partnership the preparation of which had then been commenced or (ii) the Partnership is in possession of material non-public information the disclosure of which during the period specified in such notice the Managing Partner believes in good faith would not be in the best interests of the Partnership.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Partnership shall not prohibit sales of Registrable Securities under such Shelf Registration Statement with respect to a Person set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto (or any pledgee of any such Persons KKR Units, which pledgee has been identified by such Person pursuant to Section 2.2(c) hereof) due to the occurrence of a normal quarterly blackout period under the normal quarterly trading window policy applicable to employees of the Partnership and its subsidiaries;

	provided

	that for the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership shall be entitled to prohibit sales of Registrable Securities under such Shelf Registration Statement by such Persons during any such normal quarterly blackout period with respect thereto due to circumstances independent of those that give rise to the normal quarterly blackout period;

	provided further

	that no Person set forth on




	 




	6














	 




	Schedule 1 has or shall have any employment relationship or other affiliation with the Partnership or its affiliates.




	 




	(f)


	                                  


	The Partnership shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to list all Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement on any securities exchange or quotation system on which any of the Common Units are then listed or traded.




	 




	(g)


	                                 


	Each Registering Covered Person shall, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any registration statement filed in accordance with this Article II, promptly furnish in writing to the Partnership the information set forth in Appendix A (which may be amended from time to time as necessary or advisable in light of applicable Law) and such other information regarding itself and the distribution of the Registrable Securities as the Partnership may from time to time reasonably request and such other information as may be legally required or advisable in connection with such registration.




	 




	(h)


	                                


	Each Registering Covered Person agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Partnership of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 2.2(e), such Registering Covered Person shall forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement covering such Registrable Securities until such Registering Covered Persons receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 2.2(e), and, if so directed by the Partnership, such Registering Covered Person shall deliver to the Partnership all copies, other than any permanent file copies then in such Registering Covered Persons possession, of the most recent prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice.




	 




	Section 2.3


	                                   



	Indemnification by the Partnership



	.  In the event of any registration of any Registrable Securities of the Partnership under the Securities Act pursuant to this Article II, the Partnership will, and it hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent permitted by law, each Registering Covered Person, each affiliate of such Registering Covered Person and their respective directors and officers or general and limited partners or members and managing members (including any director, officer, affiliate, employee, agent and controlling person of any of the foregoing) and each other person, if any, who controls such seller within the meaning of the Securities Act (collectively, the 

	Indemnified Parties

	), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or amendment or supplement thereto under which such Registrable Securities were registered or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (2) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any prospectus in respect of the Registrable Securities, or amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, that the Partnership shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue




	 




	7














	 




	statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Partnership by a Registering Covered Person specifically for use in the preparation thereof.




	 




	Section 2.4


	                                   



	Indemnification by Registering Covered Persons



	.  Each Registering Covered Person hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the Partnership and all other prospective sellers of Registrable Securities, the directors of the Managing Partner, each officer of the Managing Partner or the Partnership who signed the Shelf Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Partnership and all other prospective sellers of Registrable Securities within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in Section 2.3 above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Partnership by such Registering Covered Person specifically for use in the preparation of such Shelf Registration Statement, the related prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to such Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus.  Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Partnership, any of the Registering Covered Persons or any of their respective affiliates, directors, officers or controlling persons and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such person.  In no event shall any such indemnification liability of any Registering Covered Person be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such Registering Covered Person upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.




	 




	Section 2.5


	                                   



	Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings



	.  Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party hereunder of written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be made pursuant to this Article II, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Article II, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced by such failure to give notice.




	 




	In case any such action is brought against an Indemnified Party, unless in such Indemnified Partys reasonable judgment, based on advice of counsel, a conflict of interest between such Indemnified Party and indemnifying party may reasonably exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and to assume control of the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one law firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.

	Any such separate firm (x) for any Covered Person, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Indemnified Party shall be designated in writing by the Covered Person


	s


	Representative, (y) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the Managing Partner.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement or compromise of a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding, which is effected without its written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled or compromised with such consent, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or compromise.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect any settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened claim, suit, investigation or proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such claim, suit, investigation or proceeding, (B) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party, and (C) does not impose on such Indemnified Party any liability or other obligation other than the payment of monetary sums that will be fully paid by or on behalf of the indemnifying party.




	 




	Section 2.6           

	Contribution

	.  If the indemnification provided for in this Article II from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and Indemnified Parties in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of such indemnifying party and Indemnified Parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or Indemnified Parties, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action.  The amount paid or payable by a party under this Section 2.6 as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any claim, suit, investigation or proceeding.




	 




	The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 2.6 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.




	 




	Section 2.7           

	Other Indemnification

	.  Indemnification similar to that specified herein (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Partnership and the

	Registering Covered Person participating in any required registration or other qualification of securities under any Law other than the Securities Act.




	 




	Section 2.8           

	Rule 144 Reporting

	.  With a view to making available to the Covered Persons the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which may permit the sale of Common Units without registration, the Partnership agrees, as long as Registrable Securities are outstanding, to use


	all


	commercially reasonable efforts to:  (a) make and keep available adequate public information, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144, and (b) furnish to any Covered Person, so long as such Covered Person owns any Registrable Securities, (1) upon request by any Covered Person, to the extent accurate, a written statement by the Partnership that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 and (2) to the extent not then publicly available, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Partnership and such other reports and documents so filed by the Partnership as any Covered Person shall reasonably request.




	 




	Section 2.9           

	Acknowledgement Regarding the Partnership

	.  Other than those determinations reserved expressly to the Covered Persons Representative, all determinations necessary or advisable under this Article II shall be made by the Managing Partner, the determinations of which shall be final and binding.




	 




	Section 2.10         

	Mergers, Recapitalizations, Exchanges or Other Transactions Affecting Registrable Securities

	.  The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the full extent set forth herein with respect to the Registrable Securities, to any and all securities or units of the Partnership or any successor or assign of any such person (whether by merger, amalgamation, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) that may be issued in respect of, in exchange for, or in substitution of such Registrable Securities, by reason of any dividend, split, issuance, reverse split, combination, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or otherwise.

	provided however

	that with respect to securities that ceased to be Registrable Securities by virtue of clause (ii) of the definition thereof, if the condition in clause (ii) of the definition thereof ceases to be satisfied at any point during the three month period immediately following such cessation, any such securities that are still held by a Covered Person shall once again be considered Registrable Securities hereunder and the terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply with respect thereto.  If any Registrable Securities are sold pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, the provisions of Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 and this Article III shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 3.1(a).




	 




	10














	 




	(b)           Unless this Agreement is theretofore terminated pursuant to Section 3.1(a) hereof, a Covered Person shall be bound by the provisions of this Agreement with respect to any Registrable Securities until such time as such Covered Person ceases to hold any Registrable Securities or ceases to become entitled to receive Registrable Securities under the Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Thereafter, such Covered Person shall no longer be bound by the provisions of this Agreement other than Sections 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7 and this Article III.




	 




	(c)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Management Seller or Key Employee Seller shall cease to have any rights under this Agreement at the time that such person becomes a Bad Leaver (as such term is defined in the Purchase and Sale Agreement), provided, however, that no such person shall be relieved of any such persons obligations under Sections 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.




	 




	(d)           Any Permitted Transferee that owns Registrable Securities shall be a Covered Person; provided that such Permitted Transferee signs an agreement in a form  acceptable to the Partnership acknowledging that such Permitted Transferee is bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement and such agreement is received by the Partnership.

	provided

	Covered Persons Representative

	) to act on behalf of such person regarding any matter relating to or arising under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including for the purposes of:  (i) taking any action on behalf of any such Covered Person that may be necessary and desirable, as determined by the Covered Persons Representative in its sole discretion, in connection with the indemnification and contribution provisions contained in Article II, or the amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement in accordance with Section 3.2; (ii) accepting notices on behalf of any such Covered Person in

	PUBLIC COMPANY HOLDINGS UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT

	This

	PUBLIC COMPANY HOLDINGS UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT

	(this 

	Agreement

	) of

	KKR & CO L.P.

	(the 

	Partnership

	) is made by and between the Partnership and the undersigned (the 

	Grantee

	).  Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein or in the KKR & Co. L.P. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the 

	Plan

	), shall be as defined in Appendix A attached hereto and the Plan is hereby attached as Appendix E and incorporated by reference herein.




	 





	RECITALS





	 





	WHEREAS



	, the general partner of the Partnership has determined it is in the best interests of the Partnership to provide the Grantee with this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Plan.




	 





	NOW, THEREFORE



	, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements herein made and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree to the following:




	 





	ARTICLE I

	GRANT OF PUBLIC COMPANY HOLDINGS UNITS





	 





	Section 1.1.   Grant of Public Company Holdings Units; Conditions of Grant





	 




	The Partnership hereby grants to the Grantee, effective as of the Grant Date specified on the REU Grant Certificate attached hereto as Appendix B (the 

	Grant Date

	), the number of public company holdings units, which are restricted equity units set forth in the REU Grant Certificate attached hereto, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Each restricted equity unit that is granted pursuant to this Agreement represents the right to receive delivery of one Common Unit, subject to any adjustment pursuant to Section 9 of the Plan (each such restricted equity unit, an 

	REU

	).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the grant of REUs hereunder is conditioned upon the Grantees agreement to the covenants and obligations contained in the Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Obligations attached hereto as Appendix D incorporated herein by reference.




	 





	Section 1.2.   REUs and Agreement Subject to Plan; Administrator





	 




	This Agreement and the grant of REUs provided for herein shall be subject to the provisions of the Plan, except that if there are any express differences or inconsistencies between the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern. For the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership may delegate to any employee of the KKR Group its duties and powers hereunder, and any reference to the Administrator contained herein shall be deemed to include any such delegate.




	 




	2














	 





	ARTICLE II

	VESTING AND SETTLEMENT OF REUS





	 





	Section 2.1.   Vesting of REUs





	 




	(a)


	                                


	The following vesting provisions shall apply to the REUs:




	 




	(i)


	                                    


	Subject to the Grantees continued Employment through the Service Vesting Date or Service Vesting Dates, as applicable, as specified in the REU Grant Certificate attached hereto, the REUs shall become vested on such date or dates, as applicable, as to the percentage(s) set forth in such REU Grant Certificate.




	 




	(ii)


	                                 


	If, prior to the date the REUs are vested as provided in Section 2.1(a)(i) above or otherwise terminate and are forfeited pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and (c) below: (A) the Grantees Employment terminates due to the Grantees Retirement, if applicable, then all Retirement REUs shall, in the discretion of the Administrator,  be fully vested as a result thereof; (B) the Grantee dies or experiences a Disability, then all unvested REUs shall be vested as a result thereof, provided that if the Grantee is not an employee of the KKR Group, then any vesting of unvested REUs described in this clause (B) shall be in the discretion of the Administrator; or (C) there occurs a Change in Control prior to any termination of the Grantees Employment, then all or any portion of any unvested REUs may, in the discretion of the Administrator, be vested as a result thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Partnership receives an opinion of counsel that there has been a legal judgment and/or legal development in the Grantees jurisdiction that would likely result in the favorable treatment applicable to the Retirement REUs pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(ii) being deemed unlawful and/or discriminatory, then the Partnership will not apply the favorable treatment at the time the Grantees Employment terminates due to the Grantees Retirement under clause (A) above, and the REUs will be treated as set forth in Section 2.1(a)(i), 2.1(b), 2.1(c) or the other provisions of this Section 2.1(a)(ii), as applicable.




	 




	(iii)


	                              


	All REUs that become vested under this Section 2.1(a) are eligible to be Settled pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Agreement.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	If the Grantees Employment terminates for any reason other than due to the Grantees death, Disability or Retirement, each as provided for in Section 2.1(a) above, all then unvested REUs (including any REUs that are not Retirement REUs) shall immediately terminate and be forfeited without consideration, and no Common Units shall be delivered hereunder.




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	The Grantees right to vest in the REUs under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that the Grantee is no longer actively providing services (even if still considered employed or engaged under local Law) and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local Law (e.g., active Employment would not include a period of garden leave or similar period pursuant to local Law) except as may be otherwise agreed in writing by the Partnership or the Designated Service Recipient with the Grantee; the




	 




	3














	 




	Administrator shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Grantee is no longer actively employed or engaged for purposes of the REUs.




	 





	Section 2.2.   Settlement of REUs





	 




	(a)


	                                


	To the extent that (i) an REU granted hereunder becomes vested pursuant to Section 2.1(a) above and (ii) the related Service Vesting Date has also occurred, then with respect to such percentage of REUs set forth next to the applicable Service Vesting Date on the REU Grant Certificate, such REU shall be Settled as soon as administratively practicable on or following the applicable Service Vesting Date for such REU; provided that the Administrator may determine that such Settlement may instead occur on or as soon as administratively practicable after the first day of the next permissible trading window of Common Units that opens for employees of the KKR Group to sell Common Units (provided that in any event such Settlement shall not be later than the time permitted under Section 409A, if applicable).  For the avoidance of doubt, the Settlement of any REUs that become vested pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii) above shall not be accelerated, such that, with respect to any such REUs, only that percentage of such REUs that would otherwise have become vested on each applicable Service Vesting Date as set forth on the REU Grant Certificate pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(i) shall be Settled at each such Service Vesting Date in accordance with the foregoing sentence. The date on which any REU is to be Settled hereunder is referred to as a 

	Delivery Date.

	 The Settlement of each REU shall be effected in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of, Section 2.2(b) below.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	On any Delivery Date, each vested REU that is then being Settled shall be cancelled in exchange for the Partnership delivering to the Grantee either (i) the number of Common Units equal to the number of REUs that are to be Settled on such Delivery Date pursuant to Section 2.2(a) above or (ii) an amount of cash, denominated in U.S. dollars, equal to the Fair Market Value of the foregoing number of Common Units (a 



	Cash Payment



	). The Administrator may elect in its sole discretion whether to Settle the REUs in Common Units or by a Cash Payment, and in the case of the Cash Payment, whether to have the Cash Payment delivered by the member of the KKR Group that employs or engages the Grantee or to which the Grantee otherwise is rendering services (the 

	Designated Service Recipient

	).




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	Subject to the provisions of this Article II relating to the number of REUs that are to be Settled on any applicable Delivery Date and solely to the extent permitted under Section 409A, if applicable, the Partnership may impose such other conditions and procedures in relation to the Settlement of REUs as it may reasonably determine. In addition to the foregoing and notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Administrator may require that any or all of the Common Units that may be delivered to the Grantee under this Section 2.2 that the Grantee intends to sell, from time to time, may only be sold through a coordinated sales program as defined by the Administrator.




	 




	(d)


	                                


	Any of the foregoing payments or deliveries shall in all instances be subject to Sections 4.3 and 4.5 below, as applicable.




	 




	4














	 





	Section 2.3.   No Distribution Payments





	 




	The REUs granted to the Grantee hereunder do not include the right to receive any distribution payments.




	 





	ARTICLE III

	RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERS AND OTHER LIMITATIONS





	 





	Section 3.1.   Transfer Restrictions on REUs





	 




	(a)


	                                


	The Grantee may not Transfer all or any portion of the Grantees REUs to any Other Holder (including to any Family Related Holder) without the prior written consent of the Administrator, which consent may be given or withheld, or made subject to such conditions (including the receipt of such legal or tax opinions and other documents that the Partnership may require) as are determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	Any Transfer of REUs by the Grantee to Other Holders permitted by the Administrator pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall be made in accordance with Section 3.4.




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	Any purported Transfer of REUs that is not in accordance with this Section 3.1 is null and void.




	 





	Section 3.2.   Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenants





	 




	The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that Grantee is bound by and will comply with the Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Obligations contained in Appendix D, which obligations are incorporated by reference herein, and any other agreements that the Grantee has entered into with the Designated Service Recipient, the Partnership, KKR Holdings L.P., KKR Associates Holdings L.P., or any other member of the KKR Group, with respect to the Grantees obligation to keep confidential the nonpublic, confidential or proprietary information of the KKR Group and its affiliates, as applicable, and, if applicable, any restrictive covenants concerning the Grantees obligations not to compete with the KKR Group or solicit its clients or employees after termination of Employment), as such agreements may be amended from time to time.  If the Grantee is a limited partner of KKR Holdings L.P. or KKR Associates Holdings L.P., the Grantee further acknowledges and agrees that references to a Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Agreement in the limited partnership agreements of KKR Holdings L.P. and KKR Associates Holdings L.P. shall be deemed to include and also refer to the Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Obligations contained in Appendix D hereto (and authorizes and consents to the general partners of KKR Holdings L.P. and KKR Associates Holdings L.P. to amend their respective limited partnership agreements to reflect the foregoing).




	 





	Section 3.3.    Post-Settlement Transfer Restrictions on Common Units





	 




	The provisions of this Section 3.3 shall or shall not be applicable to the REUs granted to the Grantee hereunder as indicated on the REU Grant Certificate.




	 




	(a)


	                                


	The Grantee may not Transfer all or any portion of the Grantees Transfer Restricted Common Unit (as defined below) (including to any Family Related




	 




	5














	 




	Holder) without the prior written consent of the Administrator, which consent may be given or withheld, or made subject to such conditions (including the receipt of such legal or tax opinions and other documents that the Partnership may require) as are determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion.  For the avoidance of doubt, Transfer Restricted Common Units may only be held in an account with an institution, and subject to terms and conditions, which have been approved by the Administrator from time to time.  Any Transfer of Transfer Restricted Common Units by the Grantee to Other Holders permitted by the Administrator pursuant to Section 3.3(a) shall be made in accordance with Section 3.4.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	A 

	Transfer Restricted Common Unit

	 refers to all Common Units delivered upon Settlement of a vested REU until (i) the first anniversary of the Service Vesting Date related thereto, in the case of 50% of such Common Units and (ii) the second anniversary of such Service Vesting Date, in the case of the other 50% of such Common Units.




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	If the Grantee breaches in any significant or intentional manner, as determined by the Administrator in his sole discretion, any of the Grantees covenants as stated in the Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Obligations contained in Appendix D, the Administrator, in his sole discretion, may direct that the Grantee forfeit all or a portion of the Transfer Restricted Common Units held by the Grantee in an amount determined by the Administrator in his sole discretion.  The Grantee hereby consents and agrees to immediately surrender and deliver such Transfer Restricted Common Units to the Partnership, without the payment of any consideration, receipt of any further notice or fulfillment of any other condition.




	 




	(d)


	                                


	If for any reason the Grantees Employment is terminated for Cause, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator in writing, all Transfer Restricted Common Units held by the Grantee shall automatically be forfeited by the Grantee without payment of any consideration.  The Grantee hereby consents and agrees to immediately surrender and deliver such Transfer Restricted Common Units to the Partnership, without the payment of any consideration, receipt of any further notice or fulfillment of any other condition.




	 




	(e)


	                                 


	Any forfeiture of Transfer Restricted Common Units contemplated by Section 3.3(c) or Section 3.3(d) shall require no additional procedures on the part of the Partnership or its affiliates.  The Grantee hereby acknowledges that the Administrator may take any and all actions to reflect the forfeiture of Transfer Restricted Common Units hereunder, including but not limited to the delivery of a written notice to the institution contemplated in Section 3.3(a) that holds the Transfer Restricted Common Units, and agrees to take any further action to memorialize such forfeiture as the Administrator may require.




	 




	(f)


	                                  


	The Administrator may, from time to time, waive the provisions of this Section 3.3, subject to the imposition of any conditions or further requirements, as determined by the Administrator in his sole discretion.  Without limiting the foregoing, (i) the Administrator may impose equivalent transfer or forfeiture restrictions on the Grantees other equity, if any, held in KKR Holdings, L.P., the Partnership or any of their respective affiliates (or any of their respective equity incentive plans) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.3 are waived,




	 




	6














	 




	and (ii) the Grantee hereby consents in advance to the imposition of such equivalent transfer or forfeiture restrictions for purposes of the governing documents of Grantees other equity, if any, held in KKR Holdings, L.P., the Partnership or any of their respective affiliates (or any of their respective equity incentive plans) to the extent the Administrator waives the application of this Section 3.3 to the Transfer Restricted Common Units.




	 




	(g)


	                                 


	For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section 3.3 also apply in the event the Grantee receives a Cash Payment in Settlement of a vested REU on a Delivery Date as provided in Section 2.2(b).




	 




	(h)


	                                


	Any purported Transfer of Transfer Restricted Common Units that is not in accordance with this Section 3.3 is null and void.




	 





	Section 3.4.   Transfers to Other Holders





	 




	(a)


	                                


	Transfers of REUs or Transfer Restricted Common Units by the Grantee to Other Holders are not permitted unless the Administrator provides his prior written consent pursuant Section 3.1 or Section 3.3.  Prior to a Transfer of any REUs or Transfer Restricted Common Units to any Other Holder, the Other Holder must consent in writing to be bound by this Agreement as an Other Holder and deliver such consent to the Administrator.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	If an REU or Transfer Restricted Common Unit is held by an Other Holder, such Other Holder shall be bound by this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Grantee is bound hereby (or would be bound hereby had the Grantee continued to hold such REU or Transfer Restricted Common Unit). Any Transfer to an Other Holder must be undertaken in compliance with Section 3.1(a). For the avoidance of doubt, any vesting requirement of Section 2.1 above that applies to an REU or transfer or forfeiture restrictions that are applicable to Transfer Restricted Common Units (including those Transfer Restricted Common Units delivered upon Settlement of a Transferred REU) held by an Other Holder shall be satisfied or deemed to be satisfied under this Article III only to the extent that such vesting requirement or transfer or forfeiture restrictions, as applicable, would otherwise have been satisfied if the REU or Transfer Restricted Common Unit had not been Transferred by the Grantee, and any REU and Transfer Restricted Common Unit, as applicable, that is held by an Other Holder shall cease to be held by such Other Holder under this Article III if the REU or Transfer Restricted Common Unit, as applicable, would have then ceased to be held by the Grantee if the REU or Transfer Restricted Common Unit had not been Transferred by the Grantee to such Other Holder.




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	In the event of a property settlement or separation agreement between the Grantee and his or her spouse, the Grantee agrees that he or she shall use reasonable efforts to retain all of his or her REUs and Transfer Restricted Common Units and shall reimburse his or her spouse for any interest he or she may have under this Agreement out of funds, assets or proceeds separate and distinct from his or her interest under this Agreement.

	Section 3.5.   Minimum Retained Ownership Requirement





	 




	The provisions of this Section 3.5 shall or shall not be applicable to the REUs granted to the Grantee hereunder as indicated on the REU Grant Certificate.




	 




	(a)


	                                


	For so long as the Grantee retains his or her Employment, the Grantee (collectively with all Family Related Holders who become Other Holders, if applicable) must continuously hold an aggregate number of Common Unit Equivalents that is at least equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the cumulative amount of (x) all REUs granted to the Grantee under this Agreement and (y) all other REUs designated as public company holdings units that have been or are hereafter granted to the Grantee under the Plan, in each case that have become vested pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (or similar provision in any other public company holdings units grant agreement), prior to any net Settlement permitted by Section 4.5.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	

	Common Unit Equivalents

	 means any combination of: (i) REUs that are or become vested pursuant to Section 2.1 of this Agreement and Common Units delivered upon Settlement of any such REUs (even if they are Transfer Restricted Common Units) and (ii) REUs designated as public company holdings units granted to the Grantee under the Plan that are or become vested pursuant to a provision similar to Section 2.1 of this Agreement and Common Units delivered upon Settlement of any such REUs (even if a provision similar to the transfer restrictions on Transfer Restricted Common Units has not yet been satisfied).




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	The Administrator may, from time to time, waive the provisions of this Section 3.5, subject to the imposition of any conditions or further requirements, as determined by the Administrator in his sole discretion.  Without limiting the foregoing, (i) the Administrator may impose equivalent transfer restrictions on the Grantees other equity, if any, held in KKR Holdings, L.P., the Partnership or any of their respective affiliates (or any of their respective equity incentive plans) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.5 are waived, and (ii) the Grantee hereby consents in advance to the imposition of such equivalent transfer restrictions for purposes of the governing documents of Grantees other equity, if any, held in KKR Holdings, L.P., the Partnership or any of their respective affiliates (or any of their respective equity incentive plans) to the extent the Administrator waives the application of this Section 3.5 to the Common Unit Equivalents.




	 




	(d)


	                                


	Any purported Transfer of any Common Units that would result in a violation of this Section 3.5 is null and void.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 4.7) this Section 3.5 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

	(a)


	                                


	Any and all disputes which cannot be settled amicably, including any ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement (including the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision) shall be finally settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in New York, New York in accordance with the then-existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce.  If the parties to the dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within 30 days of the receipt of the request for arbitration, the International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment.  The arbitrator shall be a lawyer and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language. Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during any arbitration proceedings.  Except as required by Law or as may be reasonably required in connection with ancillary judicial proceedings to compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration, or to confirm or challenge an arbitration award, the arbitration proceedings, including any hearings, shall be confidential, and the parties shall not disclose any awards, any materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration, or any documents produced by another party in the proceedings not otherwise in the public domain. Judgment on any award rendered by an arbitration tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereover.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.2(a), the Partnership may bring an action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling the Grantee to arbitrate, seeking temporary or preliminary relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, or enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this clause (b), the Grantee (i) expressly consents to the application of Section 4.2(c) below to any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate, and (iii) irrevocably appoints the Secretary or General Counsel of the Partnership (or any officer of the Partnership) at the address identified for the Partnership as set forth in Section 4.6 below as such Grantees agent for service of process in connection with any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of process upon such agent, who shall promptly advise such Grantee of any such service of process, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Grantee in any such action or proceeding.

	Section 4.3.   Remedies; Recoupment; Right to Set-Off





	 




	(a)


	                                


	The rights and remedies provided by this Agreement are cumulative and the use of any one right or remedy by any party shall not preclude or waive its right to use any or all other remedies.  Said rights and remedies are given in addition to any other rights the parties may have by Law or under the terms of any other applicable agreement.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	To the extent required or advisable, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules promulgated thereunder and any other similar Laws, the Administrator may specify in any other document or a policy to be incorporated into this Agreement by reference, that the Grantees rights, payments, and benefits with respect to REUs awarded hereunder and/or Common Units delivered to the Grantee in respect of REUs awarded hereunder shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment.




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	The Administrator may set-off any amounts due under this Agreement or otherwise against any amounts which may be owed to the Partnership or its Affiliates by the Grantee under this Agreement, any other relationship or otherwise. The Grantee hereby expressly authorizes the Partnership and its Affiliates to take any and all actions on the Grantees behalf (including, without limitation, payment, credit and satisfaction of amounts owed) in connection with the set-off of any amounts owed to the Partnership or its Affiliates or otherwise.




	 





	Section 4.4.   Amendments and Waivers





	 




	(a)


	                                


	This Agreement (including the Definitions contained in Appendix A attached hereto, the REU Grant Certificate attached as Appendix B hereto, the Additional Terms and Conditions attached as Appendix C hereto, the Confidentiality and Restrictive Covenant Obligations attached as Appendix D hereto, and any other provisions as may be required to be appended to this Agreement under applicable local Law) may be amended, supplemented, waived or modified only in accordance with Section 4(c) of the Plan or Section 13 of the Plan, as applicable, or as may be required for purposes of compliance or enforceability with applicable local Law; provided, however, that the REU Grant Certificate shall




	 




	10














	 




	be deemed amended from time to time to reflect any adjustments provided for under the Plan.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder (other than a failure or delay beyond a period of time specified herein) shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.




	 





	Section 4.5.   Withholding





	 




	Regardless of any action the Partnership or the Designated Service Recipient takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Grantees participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Grantee (

	Tax-Related Items

	), the Grantee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Grantees responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Partnership or the Designated Service Recipient.  The Grantee further acknowledges that the Partnership and/or the Designated Service Recipient (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the REUs, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or Settlement of the REUs, the delivery of Common Units or a Cash Payment upon Settlement of the REUs, the lapse of any restrictions imposed on the Grantees Transfer Restricted Common Units, the subsequent sale of Common Units acquired under the Plan and the receipt of any distributions; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the REUs or any aspect of the REUs to reduce or eliminate the Grantees liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if the Grantee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Grantee acknowledges that the Partnership and/or the Designated Service Recipient (or the Affiliate formerly employing, engaging or retaining the Grantee, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.




	 




	Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Grantee will pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Partnership and/or the Designated Service Recipient to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, the Grantee authorizes the Partnership and/or the Designated Service Recipient, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:




	 




	(a)


	                                


	withholding from the Cash Payment, the Grantees wages or other cash compensation paid to the Grantee by the Partnership and/or the Designated Service Recipient; or




	 




	(b)


	                                


	withholding from proceeds of the sale of Common Units delivered upon Settlement of the REUs either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Partnership (on the Grantees behalf pursuant to this authorization); or




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	withholding in Common Units to be delivered upon Settlement of the REUs.




	 




	To avoid negative accounting treatment, the Partnership may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates.  If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in




	 




	11














	 




	Common Units, for tax purposes, the Grantee is deemed to have been issued the full number of Common Units subject to the Settled Common Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Common Units are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of the Grantees participation in the Plan.




	 




	Finally, the Grantee shall pay to the Partnership or the Designated Service Recipient any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Partnership or the Designated Service Recipient may be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Grantees participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Partnership may refuse to issue or deliver the Common Units, the Cash Payment or the proceeds of the sale of Common Units, if the Grantee fails to comply with the Grantees obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.




	 





	Section 4.6.   Notices





	 




	All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person, by courier service, by fax or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) to the respective parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified for purposes of notice given in accordance with this Section 4.6):

	Section 4.7.   Entire Agreement; Termination of Agreement; Survival





	 




	(a)


	                                


	This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, pertaining thereto. The Grantee acknowledges that the grant of REUs provided for under this Agreement is in full satisfaction of any and all grants of equity or equity-based awards that representatives of the Partnership or its Affiliates, on or prior to the date hereof, may have informed the Grantee that such Grantee is entitled to receive.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	This Agreement shall terminate when the Grantee and all Other Holders cease to hold any of the REUs or Transfer Restricted Common Units that have been granted or delivered, as applicable, hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Article IV shall survive any termination of this Agreement.




	 





	Section 4.8.   Severability





	 




	If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this




	 




	12














	 




	Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.  Upon a determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.




	 





	Section 4.9.   Binding Effect





	 




	This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of all of the parties and, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, their successors, executors, administrators, heirs, legal representatives and assigns.




	 





	Section 4.10.   Appendices





	 




	Appendices A, B, C and D constitute part of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article IV, the provisions of Sections 7 through 16 (inclusive) of Appendix D shall govern solely with respect to, and shall be applicable only to the interpretation, administration and enforcement of, the provisions of Appendix D, but not to any other provisions of this Agreement or any other of its Appendices, including but not limited to Sections 3.2 and 3.3(c) of this Agreement.  For the further avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing sentence, Sections 3.2 and 3.3(c) of this Agreement shall only be governed by, and shall only be subject to administration and enforcement under, the provisions of this Article IV, and shall not be governed by or subject to interpretation, administration or enforcement under any of Sections 7 through 16 (inclusive) of Appendix D.




	 





	Section 4.11.   Further Assurances





	 




	The Grantee shall perform all other acts and execute and deliver all other documents as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement.




	 





	Section 4.12.   Interpretation; Defined Terms; Section 409A; Employment with Designated Service Recipient; Headings





	 




	(a)


	                                


	Throughout this Agreement, nouns, pronouns and verbs shall be construed as masculine, feminine, neuter, singular or plural, whichever shall be applicable.  Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to Articles, Sections and clauses shall refer to corresponding provisions of this Agreement.  The word including is not meant to be exclusive, but rather shall mean including without limitation wherever used in this Agreement.  Reference to hereto, herein and similar words is to this entire Agreement (including any Appendices) and not a particular sentence or section of this Agreement. All references to date and time shall mean the applicable date (other than a Saturday or Sunday or any day on which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is closed or any day on which banks in the city of New York, New York are required to close, in which case such date refers to the next occurring date that is not described in this parenthetical) or time in New York, New York.




	 




	(b)


	                                


	This Section 4.12(b) applies to Grantees who are U.S. tax residents (such as, a U.S. citizen, greencard holder or a U.S. tax resident under the substantial presence test) to the extent applicable.  All references to any separation from




	 




	13














	 




	service or termination of the Employment of, or the services to be provided by, the Grantee, shall be deemed to refer to a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A, if applicable.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) if at the time of the Grantees termination of Employment the Grantee is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A of the Code and the deferral of the commencement of any payments or delivery of Common Units otherwise payable or provided hereunder as a result of such termination of employment is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, then the Partnership will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or delivery hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or delivery of Common Units ultimately paid or provided to the Grantee) until the date that is six months following the Grantees termination of Employment (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A) and (ii) if any other payments or other deliveries due to the Grantee hereunder could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, such payments or other deliveries shall be deferred if deferral will make such payment or other delivery compliant under Section 409A, or otherwise such payment or other delivery shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner, determined by the Administrator, that does not cause such an accelerated or additional tax.  The Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of this Section 4.12(b) in good faith; provided that none of the Partnership, the General Partner, the Administrator nor any of the Partnerships, KKR Groups employees, directors or representatives shall have any liability to the Grantee with respect to this Section 4.12(b).




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	For the avoidance of doubt, any references to the Employment of the Grantee in this Agreement refer solely to the Employment of the Grantee by the Designated Service Recipient or any other member of the KKR Group.  The grant of REUs under this Agreement in no way implies any Employment relationship with the General Partner, the Partnership or with any other member of the KKR Group, other than the Designated Service Recipient with which a formal Employment relationship is currently in effect with the Grantee, or any other member of the KKR Group with which a formal Employment relationship is currently in effect with the Grantee. If the Grantee changes Employment from the Designated Service Recipient as of the Grant Date to another member of the KKR Group, references to Designated Service Recipient hereunder shall refer to such other member of the KKR Group with which the Grantee has Employment.




	 




	(d)


	                                


	The headings and subheadings in this Agreement are included for convenience and identification only and are in no way intended to describe, interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this Agreement or any provision hereof.




	 





	Section 4.13.   Counterparts





	 




	This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.  Copies of executed counterparts transmitted by telecopy or other electronic transmission service shall be considered original executed counterparts for purposes of this Agreement.

	provided that

	in the case of this clause (iii), the Grantee has been given written notice of such breach or failure within 45 days of the KKR Group becoming aware of such breach or failure and, where such breach or failure is curable, the Grantee has failed to cure such breach or failure within (A) 15 days of receiving notice thereof or (B) such longer period of time, not to exceed 30 days, as may be reasonably necessary to cure such breach or failure provided that the Grantee is then working diligently to cure such breach or failure. If such breach or failure is not capable of being cured, the notice given to the Grantee may contain a date of termination that is earlier than 15 days after the date of such notice.




	 




	

	Disability

	C-1














	 




	(a)


	                                


	           the Plan is established voluntarily by the Partnership, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Partnership at any time;




	 




	(b)


	                                


	           the grant of the REUs is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants, or benefits in lieu of REUs, even if REUs have been granted repeatedly in the past;




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	           all decisions with respect to future grants of REUs, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Partnership;




	 




	(d)


	                                


	           the Grantees participation in the Plan shall not create a right to further Employment with the Designated Service Recipient and shall not interfere with the ability of the Designated Service Recipient to terminate the Grantees Employment or service relationship (if any) at any time;

	           the future value of the underlying Common Units is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;




	 




	(j)


	                                   


	           no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the REUs resulting from termination of the Grantees Employment (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local labor laws and whether or not later found to be invalid), and in consideration of the grant of REUs to which the Grantee is otherwise not entitled, the Grantee irrevocably agrees never to institute any claim against the Partnership, the Designated Service Recipient or any Affiliate, waives his or her ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and releases the Partnership, the Designated Service Recipient and any Affiliate from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, the Grantee shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agrees to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claims;




	 




	(k)

	), of which all or any portion may be issued as Common Units.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, beginning with the first fiscal year of the Partnership occurring after the Effective Date and continuing with each subsequent fiscal year of the Partnership occurring thereafter, the aggregate number of Common Units covered by the Plan will be increased, on the first day of




	 




	E-3














	 




	each fiscal year of the Partnership occurring during the term of the Plan, by a number of Common Units equal to the positive difference, if any, of (x) 15% of the aggregate number of Common Units outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year of the Partnership minus (y) the Initial Plan Amount, as such amount may have been increased by this sentence in any prior fiscal year, unless the Administrator should decide to increase the number of Common Units covered by the Plan by a lesser amount on any such date.  The issuance of Common Units or the payment of cash upon the exercise of an Award or any Pre-Listing Award or in consideration of the settlement, cancellation or termination of an Award or any Pre-Listing Award shall reduce the total number of Common Units covered by and available for issuance under the Plan, as applicable (with any Awards or Pre-Listing Awards settled in cash reducing the total number of Common Units by the number of Common Units determined by dividing the cash amount to be paid thereunder by the Fair Market Value of one Common Unit on the date of payment), and the issuance of Group Partnership Units in consideration of the settlement, cancellation or termination of any Pre-Listing Award shall reduce the total number of Common Units covered by and available for issuance under the Plan by a number of Common Units equal to the number of Group Partnership Units so issued

	multiplied by

	the Exchange Rate (as defined in the Employee Exchange Agreement).  Common Units which are subject to Awards which are cancelled, forfeited, terminated or otherwise expired by their terms without the payment of consideration, and Common Units which are used to pay the exercise price of any Award, may be granted again subject to Awards under the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, Common Units which are subject to Awards other than Options or Unit Appreciation Rights which are withheld to pay tax withholding obligations will be deemed not to have been delivered and will be available for further Awards under the Plan.




	 




	For purposes of this Section 3, the number of Common Units that, as of a particular date, will be considered to be covered by the Plan will be equal to the sum of (i) the number of Common Units available for issuance pursuant to the Plan but which are not subject to an outstanding Award or Pre-Listing Award as of such date, (ii) the number of Common Units subject to outstanding Awards or Pre-Listing Awards as of such date and (iii) the number of Group Partnership Units subject to outstanding Pre-Listing Awards as of such date

	multiplied by

	the Exchange Rate (as defined in the Employee Exchange Agreement) as in effect on such date.  For purposes of this Section 3, (A) an Option or Unit Appreciation Right that has been granted under the Plan or the Pre-Listing Plan will be considered to be an outstanding Award or Pre-Listing Award, as applicable, until is it exercised or cancelled, forfeited, terminated or otherwise expires by its terms, (B) a Common Unit that has been granted as an Award under the Plan that is subject to vesting conditions will be considered an outstanding Award until the vesting conditions have been satisfied or the Award otherwise terminates or expires unvested by its terms, (C) a Group Partnership Unit that has been granted as a Pre-Listing Award under the Pre-Listing Plan that is subject to vesting conditions will be considered an outstanding Pre-Listing Award until the vesting conditions have been satisfied or the Pre-Listing Award otherwise terminates or expires unvested by its terms and (D) any Award or Pre-Listing Award other than an Option, Unit Appreciation Right, Common Unit or Group Partnership Unit that is subject to vesting conditions will be considered to be an outstanding Award or Pre-Listing Award, as applicable, until it has been settled.

	Administration





	 




	(a)


	                



	Administration and Delegation



	.  The Plan shall be administered by the Administrator.  The Administrator may delegate the authority to grant Awards under the Plan to any employee or group of employees of the Partnership or of any Affiliate of the




	 




	E-4












	 




	Partnership;

	provided that

	such delegation and grants are consistent with applicable law and guidelines established by the Board from time to time.  The Administrator may delegate the day-to-day administration of the Plan to any employee or group of employees of the Partnership or the General Partner or any of their respective Affiliates or a nationally recognized third-party stock plan administrator.




	 




	(b)


	                



	Substitution of Prior Awards



	.  Awards may, in the discretion of the Administrator, be made under the Plan in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by the Partnership, any Affiliate of the Partnership or any entity acquired by the Partnership or with which the Partnership combines.  The number of Common Units underlying such substitute awards shall be counted against the aggregate number of Common Units available for Awards under the Plan.




	 




	(c)


	                 



	Interpretation; Corrections; Final and Binding Decisions



	.  The Administrator is authorized to interpret the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make any other determinations that it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan.  The Administrator may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or Award agreement in the manner and to the extent the Administrator deems necessary or desirable, without the consent of any Participant.  Any decision of the Administrator in the interpretation and administration of the Plan, as described herein, shall lie within its sole and absolute discretion and shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties concerned (including, but not limited to, Participants and their beneficiaries and successors).




	 




	(d)


	                



	Establishment of Award Terms



	.  The Administrator shall have the full power and authority to establish the terms and conditions of any Award consistent with the provisions of the Plan and to waive any such terms and conditions at any time (including, without limitation, accelerating or waiving any vesting conditions).




	 




	(e)


	                 



	Payment of Taxes Due



	.  The Administrator shall require payment of any amount it may determine to be necessary to withhold for federal, state, local or other taxes as a result of the exercise, grant or vesting of an Award.  To the extent that such withholding arises in connection with the settlement of an Award with Common Units, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, cause such payments to be funded by reducing the Common Units delivered upon settlement by an amount of Common Units having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of payments that would then be due (and if an Award is settled in cash, the Administrator may withhold cash in respect to such taxes due). The Administrator shall establish the manner in which any such tax obligation may be satisfied by the Participant.




	 





	5.




	                                     




	Limitations





	 




	No Award may be granted under the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date, but Awards theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.




	 





	6.




	                                     




	Terms and Conditions of Options





	 




	Options granted under the Plan shall be non-qualified options for federal income tax purposes, and shall be subject to the foregoing and the following terms and conditions and to such other terms and conditions, not inconsistent therewith, as the Administrator shall determine:




	 




	E-5














	 




	(a)


	                



	Option Price



	.  The Option Price per Common Unit shall be determined by the Administrator,

	provided

	that, solely for the purposes of an Option granted under the Plan to a Participant who is a U.S. taxpayer, in no event will the Option Price be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date an Option is granted.




	 




	(b)


	                



	Exercisability



	.  Options granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such time and upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Administrator, but in no event shall an Option be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted.




	 




	(c)


	                 



	Exercise of Options



	.




	 




	(i)


	                                        


	Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in an Award agreement, an Option may be exercised for all, or from time to time any part, of the Common Units for which it is then exercisable.  For purposes of this Section 6 of the Plan, the exercise date of an Option shall be the later of the date a notice of exercise is received by the Partnership and, if applicable, the date payment is received by the Partnership pursuant to clauses (A), (B), (C) or (D) in the following sentence.




	 




	(ii)


	                                     


	The Option Price for the Common Units as to which an Option is exercised shall be paid to the Partnership, and in the manner designated by the Administrator, pursuant to one or more of the following methods: (A) in cash or its equivalent (e.g., by personal check); (B) in Common Units having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Common Units being purchased and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Administrator; provided that such Common Units have been held by the Participant for such period as may be established from time to time by the Administrator in order to avoid adverse accounting treatment applying generally accepted accounting principles; (C) partly in cash and partly in such Common Units; (D) if there is a public market for the Common Units at such time, through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell Common Units obtained upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver promptly to the Partnership an amount out of the proceeds of such sale equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Common Units being purchased, or (E) to the extent permitted by the Administrator, through net settlement in Common Units.




	 




	(iii)


	                                  


	To the extent compliant with applicable laws, no Participant shall have any rights to distributions or other rights of a holder with respect to Common Units subject to an Option until the Participant has given written notice of exercise of the Option, paid in full the Option Price for such Common Units and, if applicable, has satisfied any other conditions imposed by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan.




	 




	(d)


	                



	Attestation



	.  Wherever in this Plan or any agreement evidencing an Award a Participant is permitted to pay the Option Price of an Option or taxes relating to the exercise of an Option by delivering Common Units, the Participant may, subject to procedures satisfactory to the Administrator, satisfy such delivery requirement by presenting proof of beneficial ownership of such Common Units, in which case the Partnership shall treat the Option as exercised without further payment and/or shall withhold such number of Common Units from the Common Units acquired by the exercise of the Option, as appropriate.




	 





	7.




	                                     




	Terms and Conditions of Unit Appreciation Rights





	 




	(a)


	                



	Grants



	.  The Administrator may grant (i) a Unit Appreciation Right independent of an Option or (ii) a Unit Appreciation Right in connection with an Option, or a portion thereof.




	 




	E-6














	 




	A Unit Appreciation Right granted pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence (A) may be granted at the time the related Option is granted or at any time prior to the exercise or cancellation of the related Option, (B) shall cover the same number of Common Units covered by an Option (or such lesser number of Common Units as the Administrator may determine) and (C) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as such Option except for such additional limitations as are contemplated by this Section 7 (or such additional limitations as may be included in an Award agreement).




	 




	(b)


	                



	Exercise Price



	.  The exercise price per Common Unit of a Unit Appreciation Right shall be an amount determined by the Administrator;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that in the case of a Unit Appreciation Right granted in conjunction with an Option, or a portion thereof, the exercise price may not be less than the Option Price of the related Option;

	provided

	,

	further

	that, solely for the purposes of a Unit Appreciation Right granted under the Plan to a Participant who is a U.S. taxpayer, in the case of a Unit Appreciation Right that was not granted in conjunction with an Option, the exercise price per Unit Appreciation Right shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the date the Unit Appreciation Right is granted.




	 




	(c)


	                 



	Terms of Grant



	:  Each Unit Appreciation Right granted independent of an Option shall entitle a Participant upon exercise to an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of one Common Unit over (B) the exercise price per Common Unit, times (ii) the number of Common Units covered by the Unit Appreciation Right.  Each Unit Appreciation Right granted in conjunction with an Option, or a portion thereof, shall entitle a Participant to surrender to the Partnership the unexercised Option, or any portion thereof, and to receive from the Partnership in exchange therefore an amount equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value on the exercise date of one Common Unit over (B) the Option Price per Common Unit, times (ii) the number of Common Units covered by the Option, or portion thereof, which is surrendered.  Payment shall be made in Common Units or in cash, or partly in Common Units and partly in cash (any such Common Units valued at such Fair Market Value), all as shall be determined by the Administrator.




	 




	(d)


	                



	Exercisability



	:  Unit Appreciation Rights may be exercised from time to time upon actual receipt by the Partnership of written notice of exercise stating the number of Common Units with respect to which the Unit Appreciation Right is being exercised.  The date a notice of exercise is received by the Partnership shall be the exercise date.  The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may determine that no fractional Common Units will be issued in payment for Unit Appreciation Rights, but instead cash will be paid for the fractional Common Units and the number of Common Units to be delivered will be rounded downward to the next whole Common Unit.




	 




	(e)


	                 



	Limitations



	.  The Administrator may impose, in its discretion, such conditions upon the exercisability of Unit Appreciation Rights as it may deem fit, but in no event shall a Unit Appreciation Right be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted.




	 





	8.




	                                     




	Other Unit-Based Awards





	 




	The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may grant or sell Awards of Common Units, restricted Common Units, deferred restricted Common Units, phantom restricted Common Units or other Common Unit-based awards based in whole or in part on the Fair Market Value of the Common Units (

	Other Unit-Based Awards

	).  Such Other Unit-Based Awards shall be in such form, and dependent on such conditions, as the Administrator shall determine, including, without




	 




	E-7














	 




	limitation, the right to receive, or vest with respect to, one or more Common Units (or the equivalent cash value of such Common Units) upon the completion of a specified period of service, the occurrence of an event and/or the attainment of performance objectives.  Other Unit-Based Awards may be granted alone or in addition to any other Awards granted under the Plan.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall determine to whom and when Other Unit-Based Awards will be made, the number of Common Units to be awarded under (or otherwise related to) such Other Unit-Based Awards; whether such Other Unit-Based Awards shall be settled in cash, Common Units, or other assets or a combination of cash, Common Units and other assets; and all other terms and conditions of such Awards (including, without limitation, the vesting provisions thereof and provisions ensuring that all Common Units so awarded and issued shall be fully paid and non-assessable).




	 





	9.




	                                     




	Adjustments Upon Certain Events





	 




	Notwithstanding any other provisions in the Plan to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply to all Awards granted under the Plan:




	 




	(a)


	                



	Equity Restructurings



	. In the event of any extraordinary Common Unit distribution or split, recapitalization, rights offering, split-up or spin-off or any other event that constitutes an equity restructuring (as defined under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification 718) with respect to Common Units, the Administrator shall, in the manner determined appropriate or desirable by the Administrator and without liability to any person, adjust any or all of (i) the number of Common Units or other securities of the Partnership (or number and kind of other securities or property) with respect to which Awards may be granted under the Plan, and (ii) the terms of outstanding Awards, including, but not limited to (A) the number of Common Units or other securities of the Partnership (or number and kind of other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards or to which outstanding Awards relate, (B) the Option Price or exercise price of any Option or Unit Appreciation Right and (C) any performance targets or other applicable terms.




	 




	(b)


	                



	Mergers, Reorganizations and Other Corporate Transactions



	. In the event of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, repurchase or exchange of Common Units or other securities of the Partnership, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Common Units or other securities of the Partnership, or other similar corporate transaction or event that affects the Common Units such that an adjustment is determined by the Administrator in its discretion to be appropriate or desirable, the Administrator in its sole discretion and without liability to any person shall make such substitution or adjustment, if any, as it deems to be equitable as to (i) the number of Common Units or other securities of the Partnership (or number and kind of other securities or property) with respect to which Awards may be granted under the Plan, and (ii) the terms of any outstanding Award, including (A) the number of Common Units or other securities of the Partnership (or number and kind of other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards or to which outstanding Awards relate, (B) the Option Price or exercise price of any Option or Unit Appreciation Right and (C) any performance targets or other applicable terms.




	 




	(c)


	                 



	Change in Control



	. In the event of a Change in Control after the Effective Date, (i) if determined by the Administrator in the applicable Award agreement or otherwise, any outstanding Awards then held by Participants which are unexercisable or otherwise unvested or subject to lapse restrictions shall automatically be deemed exercisable or otherwise vested or no longer subject to lapse restrictions, as the case may be, as of immediately prior to such Change in Control and (ii) the Administrator may (subject to Sections 16 and 18), but shall not




	 




	E-8














	 




	be obligated to: (A) accelerate, vest or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to all or any portion of an Award; (B) cancel such Awards for fair value (as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator) which, in the case of Options and Unit Appreciation Rights, may equal the excess, if any, of value of the consideration to be paid in the Change in Control transaction to holders of the same number of Common Units subject to such Options or Unit Appreciation Rights (or, if no consideration is paid in any such transaction, the Fair Market Value of the Common Units subject to such Options or Unit Appreciation Rights) over the aggregate exercise price of such Options or Unit Appreciation Rights; (C) provide that any Options or Unit Appreciation Right having an exercise price per Common Unit that is greater than the per Common Unit value of the consideration to be paid in the Change in Control transaction to a holder of a Common Unit shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor; (D) provide for the issuance of substitute Awards that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected Awards previously granted hereunder as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion; or (E) provide that for a period of at least 15 days prior to the Change in Control, such Options shall be exercisable as to all shares subject thereto and that upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, such Options shall terminate and be of no further force and effect.




	 





	10.




	                              




	No Right to Employment or Awards





	 




	The granting of an Award under the Plan shall impose no obligation on the Partnership or any Affiliate to continue the Employment of a Participant and shall not lessen or affect the Partnerships or Affiliates right to terminate the Employment of such Participant.  No Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award (including as a result of recurring prior Award), and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards.  No Award shall constitute compensation for purposes of determining any benefits under any benefit plan.  The terms and conditions of Awards and the Administrators determinations and interpretations with respect thereto need not be the same with respect to each Participant (whether or not such Participants are similarly situated).




	 





	11.




	                              




	Successors and Assigns





	 




	The Plan shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Partnership and a Participant, including without limitation, the estate of such Participant and the executor, administrator or trustee of such estate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or representative of the Participants creditors.




	 





	12.




	                              




	Nontransferability of Awards





	 




	Unless otherwise determined or approved by the Administrator, an Award shall not be transferable or assignable by the Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  Any transfer or assignment in violation of the prior sentence shall be null and void.  An Award exercisable after the death of a Participant may be exercised by the legatees, personal representatives or distributees of the Participant.




	 





	13.




	                              




	Amendments or Termination





	 




	The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan or any outstanding Award, but no amendment, alteration or discontinuation shall be made, without the consent of a Participant, if such action would materially diminish any of the rights of the Participant under any Award theretofore granted to such Participant under the Plan;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the




	 




	E-9














	 




	Administrator may without the Participants consent (a) amend the Plan or any outstanding Award in such manner as it deems necessary to permit the granting of Awards meeting the requirements of the Code or other applicable laws (including, without limitation, to avoid adverse tax consequences to the Partnership or to Participants as provided in Section 14 and Section 18 below), and (b) amend any outstanding Awards in a manner that is not adverse (other than in a

	de minimis

	manner) to a Participant, except as otherwise may be permitted pursuant to Section 9 hereof or as is otherwise contemplated pursuant to the terms of the Award, without the Participants consent.




	 





	14.




	                              




	International Participants





	 




	With respect to Participants who reside or work outside the United States of America, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the Plan or Awards with respect to such Participants in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local law or to obtain more favorable tax or other treatment for a Participant, the Partnership or an Affiliate.




	 





	15.




	                              




	Choice of Law





	 




	The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York without giving effect to any otherwise governing principles of conflicts of law that would apply the laws of another jurisdiction.




	 





	16.




	                              




	Other Laws; Restrictions on Transfer of Common Units





	 




	The Administrator may refuse to issue or transfer any Common Units or other consideration under an Award if, acting in its sole discretion, it determines that the issuance or transfer of such Common Units or such other consideration might violate any applicable law or regulation or entitle the Partnership to recover the same under Section 16(b) of the Act, as amended, and any payment tendered to the Partnership by a Participant, other holder or beneficiary in connection with the exercise of such Award shall be promptly refunded to the relevant Participant, holder or beneficiary. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Award granted hereunder shall be construed as an offer to sell securities of the Partnership, and no such offer shall be outstanding, unless and until the Administrator in its sole discretion has determined that any such offer, if made, would be in compliance with all applicable requirements of the United States federal and any other applicable securities laws.




	 





	17.




	                              




	Effectiveness of the Plan





	 




	The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date.




	 





	18.




	                              




	Section 409A





	 




	To the extent applicable, this Plan and Awards issued hereunder shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretative guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date.  Notwithstanding other provisions of the Plan or any Award agreements issued thereunder, no Award shall be granted, deferred, accelerated, extended, paid out or modified under this Plan in a manner that would result in the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A of the Code upon a Participant.  In the event that it is reasonably determined by the Administrator that, as a result of Section 409A of the Code, payments in respect of any Award under the Plan may not be made at the time




	 




	E-10














	 




	contemplated by the terms of the Plan or the relevant Award agreement, as the case may be, without causing the Participant holding such Award to be subject to taxation under Section 409A of the Code, consistent with the provisions of Section 13(a) above, the Partnership may take whatever actions the Administrator determines necessary or appropriate to comply with, or exempt the Plan and Award agreement from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance and other interpretive materials as may be issued after the Effective Date including, without limitation, (a) adopting such amendments to the Plan and Awards and appropriate policies and procedures, including amendments and policies with retroactive effect, that the Administrator determines necessary or appropriate to preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided by the Plan and Awards hereunder and/or (b) taking such other actions as the Administrator determines necessary or appropriate to avoid the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, which action may include, but is not limited to, delaying payment to a Participant who is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code until the first day following the six-month period beginning on the date of the Participants termination of Employment


	.  The Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of this Section 18 in good faith;

	provided

	that neither the Partnership, the Administrator nor any employee, director or representative of the Partnership or of any of its Affiliates shall have any liability to Participants with respect to this Section 18

	        As previously reported in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, a European subsidiary
	of a portfolio company in which our private equity funds have invested provided certain limited disaster recovery services and hosted co-location of some hardware at the portfolio company's premises
	in London for Bank Saderat PLC, a bank incorporated and based in the United Kingdom. The company has informed us that the gross revenue and net profits attributable to these activities was less
	than £5,000 each for the quarter ended March 31, 2013. We have been advised that the subsidiary terminated this contract in the first quarter of 2013, and the portfolio company does
	not otherwise intend to enter into any Iran-related activity.
