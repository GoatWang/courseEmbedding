Review 
Michael Ray won the CW televised musical competition The Next: Fame Is at Your Doorstep in 2012, assisted by the mentorship of Big  Rich's John Rich. Ray didn't deliver a full album for another three years, but that's a sign of how deliberately the Nashville machine can move when they know they have somebody with real potential in their hands. Ray did some work behind the scenes, co-writing Big  Rich's single "Run Away with You" with Rich, but the real energy was channeled to his eponymous debut, produced by Scott Hendricks and released in the summer of 2015. The debut is canny commercial contemporary country, pitched halfway between the big, bright punch of bro country and the sentimental side of Rich's associated artists. Ray is better served by the former than the latter: he can handle a nicely modulated ballad, like "Look Like This," but stumbles on the laundry list of red-state necessities in "Real Men Love Jesus," never letting the calculation seem like anything less than pandering. Pick the tempo up, though, and he's a friendly, personable purveyor of country-pop, whether he's singing a love song ("Kiss You in the Morning") or threatening to burn this mother down ("Livin' It Up," which never gets too wild, no matter the threats). Michael Ray still seems a bit like a personality tailor-made for television -- he's prettier on the album cover than he is on record, where he's merely amiable -- but his debut is an expertly made piece of modern country product that pleases and, if it gets the right break on radio, could even wind up as memorable. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi

Michael Ray won the CW televised musical competition The Next: Fame Is at Your Doorstep in 2012, assisted by the mentorship of Big  Rich's John Rich. Ray didn't deliver a full album for another three years, but that's a sign of how deliberately the Nashville machine can move when they know they have somebody with real potential in their hands. Ray did some work behind the scenes, co-writing Big  Rich's single "Run Away with You" with Rich, but the real energy was channeled to his eponymous debut, produced by Scott Hendricks and released in the summer of 2015. The debut is canny commercial contemporary country, pitched halfway between the big, bright punch of bro country and the sentimental side of Rich's associated artists. Ray is better served by the former than the latter: he can handle a nicely modulated ballad, like "Look Like This," but stumbles on the laundry list of red-state necessities in "Real Men Love Jesus," never letting the calculation seem like anything less than pandering. Pick the tempo up, though, and he's a friendly, personable purveyor of country-pop, whether he's singing a love song ("Kiss You in the Morning") or threatening to burn this mother down ("Livin' It Up," which never gets too wild, no matter the threats). Michael Ray still seems a bit like a personality tailor-made for television -- he's prettier on the album cover than he is on record, where he's merely amiable -- but his debut is an expertly made piece of modern country product that pleases and, if it gets the right break on radio, could even wind up as memorable. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi

 Career History



Chief Executive Officer & Director

                                    1998 - Current                


Vera Bradley Designs, Inc.


                  Vera Bradley was founded in 1982 by friends Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia R. Miller. Today, internationally recognized Vera Bradley offers a large selection of cotton quilted handbags, travel bags, accessories and innovative limited edition lines, including microfiber, silk and tweed collections. Vera Bradley licensed products include fine tableware, furniture, men’s ties, rugs and linens, as well as rolling luggage, stationery and eyewear. For more information on Vera Bradley, visit                




Chief Executive Officer & Director

                                    1998 - 2013                


Vera Bradley, Inc.


                  Guided by our founders, Patricia R. Miller and Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, Vera Bradley has earned a reputation as a leader in the gift industry. Creating stylish quilted cotton luggage, handbags and accessories, the company combines smart product designs with distinctive and colorful fabrics and trims.

The Vera Bradley story is a testimony to the American Dream.
While on vacation in March of 1982, Patricia and Barbara were awaiting a flight in Atlanta when they noticed a definite lack of feminine-looking luggage. The longtime friends wasted no time in correcting this situation. Within weeks, these dynamic women had created a company, named after Barbara's mother, capable of marketing and manufacturing their cleverly designed products. The demand for these unique handbags and luggage items has grown and so has Vera Bradley, which is now nationally and internationally recognized.

For over 20 years, Vera Bradley has had a loyal following of customers who not only look forward to our lovely new fabrics and styles that are introduced each season, but who also appreciate the function and quality that is synonymous with our name.

Vera Bradley, Inc.

                    Guided by our founders, Patricia R. Miller and Barbara Bradley Baekgaard, Vera Bradley has earned a reputation as a leader in the gift industry. Creating stylish quilted cotton luggage, handbags and accessories, the company combines smart product designs with distinctive and colorful fabrics and trims.

The Vera Bradley story is a testimony to the American Dream.
While on vacation in March of 1982, Patricia and Barbara were awaiting a flight in Atlanta when they noticed a definite lack of feminine-looking luggage. The longtime friends wasted no time in correcting this situation. Within weeks, these dynamic women had created a company, named after Barbara's mother, capable of marketing and manufacturing their cleverly designed products. The demand for these unique handbags and luggage items has grown and so has Vera Bradley, which is now nationally and internationally recognized.

For over 20 years, Vera Bradley has had a loyal following of customers who not only look forward to our lovely new fabrics and styles that are introduced each season, but who also appreciate the function and quality that is synonymous with our name.

Review

Dark and sinister is the new sexy, thanks to Dexter, which in its second season has proven to be the most successful series Showtime has offered up yet. Remember how much you squirmed in your seat during the season one finale? Believe it or not, the premiere of season two felt like it could have been a season finale--because jaws were on the floor when the credits rolled. For being a supposed sociopath, Dex is pretty broken up about the gruesome events that concluded last season. The one and only person who could possibly understand him is six feet under, and it seems our unlikely hero is losing his homicidal grip. He’s even having a little trouble slicing up a few of his latest victims (from a murderous gang member to a chainsaw-wielding fiend from his past). Enter Lila (Jaime Murray, Hustle), a lady with a sweet British accent and a few dark secrets of her own. She seems to accept Dex for who he really is, and he finds himself feeling relaxed for the first time in his life. In contrast, his relationship with his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz) has been stretched almost to a breaking point. The problem is, he should be anything but relaxed. Someone picked a poor place to go scuba diving off the Florida coast, and came across an underwater graveyard: Dex’s primo spot for dropping dismembered bodies wrapped in heavy-duty trash bags. Word about the "Bay Harbor Butcher" gets out quick, and the F.B.I. sends the best of the best, Special Agent Frank Lundy (Keith Carradine, Deadwood) to work alongside the police to sniff out Miami’s latest serial killer. This guy is no schlub, and Dex may have met his match. And, yes, Dexter gets to work with Lundy on a daily basis, which provides some wonderfully awkward moments. It certainly doesn’t help that the intuitively paranoid Sergeant Doakes (Erik King, Oz) is hot on Dex’s trail.  Season two of Dexter is all about decisions. Lila or Rita? Old code or new code? Run or fight? Right or wrong? Well, one thing’s for sure: When it comes to writing, casting, acting, and production, the makers of this show made all the right decisions. Michael C. Hall is simply superb as the title character. You’ll never find yourself more willing to genuinely root for a serial killer. It’s bloody liberating. --Jordan Thompson
