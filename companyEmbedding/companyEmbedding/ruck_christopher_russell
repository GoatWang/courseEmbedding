Christopher Russell Print
by Christopher Russell

Please welcome Christopher Russell to the Little Paper Press!!  For Christopher’s print we decided to go with an Archival Digital print to accent the lushness of the magical worlds he creates.  This print is printed with archival inks on german etching paper.  It measures  9 1/2  x 12 which includes a 1/2 white border.  His signature is printed on the print and it is hand numbered in a second edition of 10.  The first edition was in 15.
This edition is sold out.

Description

                                                                                                    
2002 As exact-as-possible reproduction of a photo album I found that was filled with images of cats. I imagined a bit of reclusion and social dysfunction, but really, who doesn’t love a crazy cat lady.
9X10 hand bound with cording

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
