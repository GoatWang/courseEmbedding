  East Slopes Project » 








































 






















 




East Slopes Project

  

Kern County, California
This page updated 07/17/17



The East Slopes Project is located in the southeastern part of the San Joaquin Basin near Bakersfield, California.  Drilling targets are porous and permeable sandstone reservoirs that exist at depths of 1,200 feet to 4,500 feet.  Since January 2009, we have participated in the drilling of 25 wells in this project.  We have been the Operator at the East Slopes Project since March 2009.
The crude oil produced from our acreage from the Vedder Sand is considered heavy oil.  The crude oil ranges from 14° to 16° API gravity and must be heated to separate and remove water prior to sale.  Our crude oil wells in the East Slopes Project produce from five reservoirs at our Sunday, Bear, Black, Ball and Dyer Creek locations.  The Sunday property has six producing wells, while the Bear property has nine producing wells.  The Black property is the smallest of all currently producing reservoirs, and currently has two producing wells at this property.  The Ball property also has two producing wells while the Dyer Creek property has one producing well.
During the three months ended May 31, 2017 we had production from 20 vertical crude oil wells.  Our average working interest and NRI in these 20 wells is 36.6% and 28.4%, respectively.
There are several other similar prospects on trend with the Bear, Black and Dyer Creek reservoirs exhibiting the same seismic characteristics.  Some of these prospects, if successful, would utilize the Company’s existing production facilities.  In addition to the current field development, there are several other exploratory prospects that have been identified from the seismic data, which we plan to drill in the future.
California Drilling Plans
Planned drilling activity and implementation of our oilfield development plan will not begin until there is a sustained improvement in crude oil prices and additional financing is in put in place.  We plan to spend approximately $75,000 in new capital investments within the East Slopes Project area in the 2017 – 2018 fiscal year.
California Producing Properties
Sunday Property
In November 2008, we made our initial crude oil discovery drilling the Sunday #1 well.  The well was put on production in January 2009.  Production is from the Vedder Sand at approximately 2,000 feet.  During 2009, we drilled three development wells including one horizontal well: the Sunday #2, Sunday #3 and Sunday #4H wells, respectively.  During May and June 2013, we drilled two additional development wells: the Sunday #5 and Sunday #6.  We have a 37.5% working interest with a 26.1% net revenue interest (“NRI”) in the Sunday #1 well.  For the Sunday #2 and Sunday #3 wells, we have a 33.8% working interest with a 24.3% NRI.  In the Sunday #4H well, we have a 33.8% working interest with a 27.1% NRI.  In both the Sunday #5 and Sunday #6 wells we have a 37.5% working interest and a NRI of 30.1%.  Our average working interest and NRI for the Sunday property in aggregate is 35.6% and 27.0%, respectively.  The Sunday reservoir is estimated to be approximately 35 acres in size with the potential for at least five more development wells to be drilled in the future.
Bear Property
In February 2009, we made our second crude oil discovery drilling the Bear #1 well, which is approximately one mile northwest of our Sunday discovery.  The well was put on production in May 2009.  Production is from the Vedder Sand at approximately 2,200 feet.  In December 2009, we began a development program on this property by drilling and completing the Bear #2 well.  In April 2010, we successfully drilled and completed the Bear #3 and the Bear #4 wells.  In May and June 2013, we drilled three additional development wells, the Bear #5, Bear #6 and Bear #7, on this property.  In November 2013, we drilled and put on production two additional development wells: the Bear #8 and Bear #9.  We have a 37.5% working interest in all wells on the Bear property.  Our NRI in the Bear #1, Bear #2, Bear #3 and Bear #4 wells is 26.1%.  For the Bear #5, Bear #6 and Bear #7 wells our NRI is 30.1%.  Our NRI in the Bear #8 and Bear #9 wells is 31.7%.  The average working interest and NRI for the Bear property in aggregate is 37.5% and 28.7%, respectively.  The Bear reservoir is estimated to be approximately 62 acres in size with the potential for at least ten more development wells to be drilled in the future.
Black Property
The Black property was acquired through a farm-in arrangement with a local operator.  The Black property is just south of the Bear property on the same fault system.  The Black #1 well was completed and put on production in January 2010.  Production is from the Vedder Sand at approximately 2,200 feet.  In May 2013, we drilled a development well, the Black #2, on this property.  We have a 33.8% working interest with a 26.8% NRI in all wells on this property.  The Black reservoir is estimated to be approximately 13 acres in size with the potential for at least three more development wells to be drilled in the future.
Ball Property
The Ball #1-11 well was put on production in late October 2010.  In June 2013 we drilled a development well, the Ball #2-11, on this property.  Production on this property is from the Vedder Sand at approximately 2,500 feet.  We have a 37.5% working interest with a 31.2% NRI in all wells on this property.  Our 3-D seismic data indicates a reservoir of approximately 38 acres in size with the potential for at least three more development wells to be drilled in the future.
Dyer Creek Property
The Dyer Creek #67X-11 (“DC67X”) well was also put on production in late October 2010.  This well is producing from the Vedder Sand and is located to the north of the Bear property on the same trapping fault.  We have a 37.5% working interest with a 31.2% NRI in all wells on this property.  The Dyer Creek property has the potential for at least one development well in the future.
California Drilling Plans
Planned drilling activity and implementation of our oilfield development plan will not begin until there is a sustained improvement in crude oil prices and additional financing is put in place.  We plan to spend approximately $75,000 in new capital investments within the East Slopes Project area in the 2017-2018 fiscal year.

  Operational Strategy » 








































 






















 




Operational Strategy

  

Daybreak Oil and Gas is focused on proving, developing, and producing its crude oil reserves on its acreage at its East Slopes Project in Kern County, California. Daybreak owns a 3-D seismic survey that encompasses 20,000 acres over 32 square miles with approximately 3,700 under lease in the San Joaquin Valley of California.  Daybreak has recently acquired a 30% working interest in 1,400 acres in the Michigan Basin where we have two shallow crude oil prospects.
Daybreak’s Strategy
Our basic business model is to increase shareholder value by finding and developing crude oil and natural gas reserves through exploration and development activities and selling the production from those reserves at a profit.
To accomplish this we:

use 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies to evaluate our acreage and prove our crude oil reserves;


apply advanced drilling and completion techniques to develop our crude oil reserves; and


have the necessary facilities to produce and market our crude oil production in a low cost manner.
