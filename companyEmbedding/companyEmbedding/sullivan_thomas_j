Rev. Thomas J. Sullivan, s.j.-Assignment Record






Assignment Record – Rev. Thomas J. Sullivan, s.j. 

Summary of Case: Thomas J. Sullivan was ordained a Jesuit priest of the California Province in 1944. His assignments took him to Jesuit Universities in Los Angeles and San Francisco CA, as well as to Japan, Rome and  Hawaii. In Los Angeles he directed a retreat center while residing at a high school. Sullivan died in 1992. He was accused in 2002 of abuse in Los Angeles in 1953.  In a 2003 lawsuit he was accused of sexually abusing a male high school student, also in Los Angeles,1956-1958. A 2004 archdiocesan report shows that three people had thus far come forward with reports of abuse said to have occurred  1952-1958. 

Ordained: June 17, 1944 
Died: Feb. 2, 1992

Priests 
        in a Parish: We use the following convention to show a priest's 
        place among the clergy of a parish: 1/2 means that he is the first priest 
        listed in the Official Catholic Directory (usually the pastor) 
        and that there is a total of two priests at the parish. The shorthand 3/4 
        means that the priest is listed third on a four-priest roster. See our sample 
          page from the Directory.

Note: The 
          Official Catholic Directory aims to report the whereabouts of Catholic 
        priests in the United States on January 1 of the Directory's publication 
        year. Our working assumption is that a priest listed in the Directory 
        for a given year was at the same assignment for part of the previous year 
        as well. However, Kenedy and Sons will sometimes accept updates well into 
        the year of publication. Diocesan clergy records are rarely available to 
        correct this information. The Directory is also sometimes misleading 
        or wrong. We have tried to create an accurate assignment record, given the 
        source materials and their limitations. Assignment records are a work in 
        progress and we are always improving the records that we post. Please email 
          us with new information and corrections.

        This assignment record collates Sullivan's career history as it is represented 
        in the Official Catholic Directory with allegations as reported in 
        the media. We make no representation regarding the truth of the allegation 
        we report, and we remind our readers that the U.S. legal system presumes 
        that a person accused of or charged with a crime is innocent until proven 
        guilty. Similarly, individuals who may be defendants in civil actions are 
        presumed not to be liable for such claims unless a plaintiff proves otherwise. 
        Admissions of guilt or liability are not typically a part of civil or private 
        settlements. For more information, see our posting 
          policy.

    This assignment record was last updated on Aug. 12, 2014.
