                           In this thesis we study the performance of update algorithms for replicated data in a distributed database. In doing so, we
                              also investigate several other related issues. We start by presenting a simple model of a distributed database which is suitable
                              for studying updates and concurrency control. We also develop a performance model and a set of parameters which represent
                              the most important performance features of a distributed database. The distributed database models are used to study the performance
                              of update algorithms for replicated data. This is done in two steps. First the algorithms are analyzed in the case of completely
                              replicated databases in a no failure, update only environment. Then, the restrictions that we made are eliminated one at a
                              time, and the impact on the system performance of doing this is evaluated. For the first step, we develop a new technique
                              for analyzing the performance of update algorithms. This iterative technique is based on queueing theory. Several well known
                              update algorithms are analyzed using this technique. The performance results are verified through detailed simulations of
                              the algorithms. The results show that centralized control algorithms nearly always perform better than the more popular distributed
                              control algorithms

                           Abstract: "A multidatabase system (MDBS) is a facility that allows users access to data located in multiple autonomous database
                              management systems (DBMSs). In such a system, global transactions are executed under the control of the MDBS. Independently,
                              local transactions are executed under the control of the local DBMSs. Each local DBMS integrated by the MDBS may employ a
                              different transaction management scheme. In addition, each local DBMS has complete control over all transactions (global and
                              local) executing at its site, including the ability to abort at any point any of the transactions executing at its site

                           worldwide
                           Abstract: "Fault-tolerant computer systems have redundant paths connecting their components. Given these paths, it is possible
                              to use aggressive techniques to reduce the average value and variability of the response time for critical messages. One technique
                              is to send a copy of a packet over an alternate path before it is know if the first copy failed or was delayed. A second technique
                              is to split a single stream of packets over multiple paths. We analyze both approaches and show that they can provide significant
                              improvements over conventional, conservative mechanisms."

                           worldwide
                           Abstract: "The performance of distributed text document retrieval systems is strongly influenced by the organization of the
                              inverted index. This paper compares the performance impact on query processing of various physical organizations for inverted
                              lists. We present a new probalistic model of the database and queries. Simulation experiments determine which variables most
                              strongly influence response time and throughput. This leads to a set of design trade-offs over a wide range of hardware configurations
                              and new parallel query processing strategies."

                                 redundancy to improve real-time communications. We consider two policies, one that evenly distributes load, and one that partitions

                              Abstract: "In a distributed environment, tasks often have processing demands on multiple different sites. A distributed task
                                 is usually divided up into several subtasks, each one to be executed at some site in order. In a real-time system, an overall
                                 deadline is usually specified by an application designer indicating when a distributed task is to be finished. However, the
                                 problem of how a global deadline is automatically translated to the deadline of each individual subtask has not been well
                                 studied. This paper examines (through simulations) four strategies for subtask deadline assignment in a distributed soft real-time
                                 environment."

                              Abstract: "A common class of existing information retrieval system provides access to abstracts. For example Stanford University,
                                 through its FOLIO system, provides access to the INSPEC database of abstracts of the literature on physics, computer science,
                                 electrical engineering, etc. In this paper this database is studied by using a trace- driven simulation. We focus on physical
                                 index design, inverted index caching, and database scaling in a distributed shared-nothing system. All three issues are shown
                                 to have a strong effect on response time and throughput. Database scaling is explored in two ways. One way assumes an 'optimal'
                                 configuration for a single host and then linearly scales the database by duplicating the host architecture as needed

                              Abstract: "Complex distributed tasks often involve parallel execution of subtasks at different nodes. To meet the deadline
                                 of a global task, all of its parallel subtasks have to be finished on time. Comparing to a local task (which involves execution
                                 at only one node), a global task may have a much harder time making its deadline because it is fairly likely that at least
                                 one of its subtasks run into an overloaded node. Another problem with complex distributed tasks occurs when a global task
                                 consists of a number of serially executing subtasks. In this case, we have the problem of dividing up the end-to-end deadline
                                 of the global task and assigning them to the intermediate subtasks. In this paper, we study both of these problems. Different
                                 algorithms for assigning deadlines to subtasks are presented and evaluated."

                              Abstract: "Searching over heterogeneous information sources is difficult because of the non-uniform query languages. Our approach
                                 is to allow a user to compose Boolean queries in one rich front-end language. For each user query and target source, we transform
                                 the user query into a subsuming query that can be supported by the source but that may return extra documents. The results
                                 are then processed by a filter query to yield the correct final result. In this paper we introduce the architecture and associated
                                 algorithms for generating the supported subsuming queries and filters. We show that generated subsuming queries return a minimal
                                 number of documents; we also discuss how minimal cost filters can be obtained. We have implemented prototype versions of these
                                 algorithms and demonstrated them on heterogeneous Boolean systems."

                              A read-only transaction or query is a transaction which does not modify any data. Read-only transactions could be processed
                                 with general transaction processing algorithms, but in many cases it is more efficient to process read-only transactions with
                                 special algorithms which take advantage of the knowledge that the transaction only reads. This paper defines the various consistency
                                 and currency requirements that read-only transactions may have. The processing of the different classes of read-only transactions
                                 in a distributed database is discussed. The concept of R insularity is introduced to characterize both the read-only and update
                                 algorithms. Several simple update and read-only transaction processing algorithms are presented to illustrate how the query
                                 requirements and the update algorithms affect the read-only transaction processing algorithms. (Author)

                                 delaying the completion of shorter and more common transactions. To alleviate this problems [sic] we propose an extension
                                 to two-phase locking, called altruistic locking, whereby LLTs can release their locks early. Transactions that access this
                                 released data are said to run in the wake of the LLT and must follow special locking rules. Altruistic locking guarantees
                                 serializability and does not a priori specify an order in which database objects must be accessed."

                              We apply the idea of the standard inverted index to index user profiles. We devise an alternative to the standard inverted
                                 index, in which we, instead of indexing every term in a profile, select only the significant ones to index. We evaluate their
                                 performance and show that the indexing methods require orders of magnitude fewer I/Os to process a document than when no index
                                 is used. We also show that the proposed alternative performs better in terms of I/O and CPU processing time in many cases."

Overview


Description
 
 For Database Systems and Database Design and Application courses offered at the junior, senior and graduate levels in Computer Science departments.

Written by well-known computer scientists, this introduction to database systems offers a comprehensive approach, focusing on database design, database use, and implementation of database applications and database management systems.
The first half of the book provides in-depth coverage of databases from the point of view of the database designer, user, and application programmer. It covers the latest database standards SQL:1999, SQL/PSM, SQL/CLI, JDBC, ODL, and XML, with broader coverage of SQL than most other texts. The second half of the book provides in-depth coverage of databases from the point of view of the DBMS implementor. It focuses on storage structures, query processing, and transaction management. The book covers the main techniques in these areas with broader coverage of query optimization than most other texts, along with advanced topics including multidimensional and bitmap indexes, distributed transactions, and information integration techniques.
 
Resources: 
   Open access Author Website  http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/dscb.html includes Power Point slides, teaching notes, assignments, projects, Oracle Programming Guidelines, and solutions to selected exercises.

New to This Edition
  Chapters have been extensively reorganized and augmented.  Relational modeling is covered in chapters 2-4.   Chapter 4 is devoted to high-level modeling, and includes the E/R model as well as UML (Unified Modeling Language).  The viewpoint of Chapter 3 - which focuses on functional and multivalued dependencies - has been modified, so that a functional dependency is now assumed to have a set of attributes on the right. Explicitly certain algorithms, including the “chase,” allow us to manipulate dependencies. The discussion of third normal form has been augmented to include the 3NF synthesis algorithm and to delineate the tradeoff between 3NF and BCNF.  Chapter 5 contains the coverage of relational algebra from the previous edition, and is joined by (part of) the treatment of Datalog from the old Chapter 10.   The discussion of recursion in Datalog is either moved to the book’s Web site or combined with the treatment of recursive SQL in Chapter 10 of this edition.  Chapters 6-10 are devoted to aspects of SQL programming, and they represent a reorganization and augmentation of the earlier book’s Chapters 6, 7, 8, and parts of 10. The material on indexes and views has been moved to its own chapter, number 8, and this material has been augmented with a discussion of important new topics, including materialized views, and automatic selection of indexes.  The New Chapter 9 is based on the old Chapter 8 (embedded SQL). It is introduced by a new section on 3-tiered architecture. It also includes an expanded discussion of JDBC and new coverage of PHP.  Chapter 10 collects a number of advanced SQL topics, including the nested-relation model, object-relational features of SQL, and data cubes.  Chapters 11 and 12, covering XML and XML-based systems, contain new and expanded material on modeling and programming, including XML schema, DTD's, XPath, XQuery, and XSLT.  Chapter 20, covering parallel and distributed databases, includes new sections on distributed query execution, the map-reduce framework for parallel computation, peer-to-peer databases and their implementation of distributed hash tables.  New sections on local-as-view mediators and entity resolution have been added to Chapter 21, which covers information integration.  The expanded data mining chapter includes material on association rules and frequent itemset mining, including both the famous A-Priori Algorithm and certain efficiency improvements. Key techniques of shingling, minhashing, locality-sensitive hashing, and clustering have been added.  An entirely new Chapter 23 addresses ways in which the Internet has impacted database technology through search engines and data-stream management systems.

 Hector Garcia-Molina's Current Interests 

I am a member of the Stanford InfoLab, together 
with my colleagues Jennifer Widom
and Jure Leskovec
(plus emeritus members Jeff Ullman
and Gio Wiederhold). Our InfoLab focuses on information
management: all types of information, from structured data in traditional databases, to unstructured,
media-rich information at sites like Twitter and Facebook. And we focus on all types of management,
from collection and extraction of the data, to its storage, to its analysis. 
On this Web page I give some examples of my current interests. Note that even though not reflected
directly in these examples, I continue to be interested in traditional problems dealing with database
management systems, distributed data management, digital libraries, and peer-to-peer systems. Also
note that my interests are evolving all the time, often driven by what new problems students or industry
colleagues introduce me to, so for the latest, stop by and chat!
 For each example, I give a brief summary plus one or two references to recent papers. Click on the links
at left or just scroll down. 


Web Analytics:

The Web contains a wealth of information, and there are many challenges in getting the data,
interpreting it, organizing it, and learning from it. For instance, one type of information is the tags
that people associate with their photos, web pages and other resources. (For example, a photo may
be tagged with the words "San Francisco" or an Amazon book may be tagged with "romantic novel".)
How useful and accurate are such tags? Do they really help people find things they want? In the paper
"Tagging Human Knowledge" we compared the tags that people attached to books at several social
cataloguing sites, to tags added by professional librarians. Do you think unpaid volunteers at the social
sites do a better job than the librarians? A more comprehensive job? To find out, read the paper!


There are many different types of data that we are analyzing in the InfoLab, but often the challenge is
in actually getting the data. One of the main problems is that source may be unwilling to give you a full
data set (or not able to due to the high volume), and they instead give you a sample of the data. This
was the case with data we were getting from Twitter: it only represented about 10% of the tweets made
over a couple of months (and we are not even sure what the actual fraction was). So, how does the fact
you are analyzing sampled data affect your results? For instance, say you are trying to predict how fast
a bit of news propagates across the Twitter social graph. If your analysis says 1 hour but you used a 10%
sample, is the correct answer 10 hours? Or a tenth of an hour? Or the same one hour? And is there any
way of knowing, just by looking at the sample, what was the actual sampling rate? To get some answers,
see "Correcting for Missing Data in Information Cascades". 


CrowdSourcing:

People are another information resource, and in the InfoLab we are exploring how we can combine
a "crowd" (lots of people) source with traditional sources. Sites such as Mechanical Turk make it
possible to ask people (for a small fee) for information, or to perform tasks that are hard for computers
to do. For example, say we want to build a table (relation) for restaurants. The attributes (columns) for
such a table include the name of the restaurant, the address, the city, the rating and the cuisine. Some
the attributes (e.g., name and address) could come from a traditional stored database, while the others
may come from the crowd, i.e., may be the result of asking people for their opinions. We are currently
building a database system, DECO, that can support such a table. The end user will be unaware that
some of the attributes are crowd sourced. He will be able to pose queries, using standard SQL (well,
almost standard). For instance, he may ask for "four-star Chinese restaurants in Palo Alto". If the system
does not have the ratings or the cuisine for some Palo Alto restaurants, it will on the fly issue requests
to humans (e.g., via Mechanical Turk) to get the missing data. Note that in many cases multiple requests
will need to be issued to the compute the average rating of a restaurant, or the consensus cuisine. If
there are not enough Palo Alto restaurants in the database, DECO may even asks humans for the names
of additional restaurants. One of the important challenges here is in finding a "good" plan for answering
a query, as we may wish to minimize the number of crowd requests made, or the amount of time taken
to get some minimal number of answer restaurants, and with a given level of "quality" (e.g., number of
votes used to compute a rating). We are currently writing a paper that describes DECO, and I will post it
here as soon as it is ready. 
In addition to the database aspects of crowdsourcing, we are also exploring some of the algorithmic
challenges. To illustrate, say we have a set of 1000 photos and we are trying to find the best one, for
some definition of best. We can issue requests to humans to compare 2 photos and tell us which one
they like best. (There are many other choices for the crowd interface: for instance, we could show
humans 5 photos and ask them to order them by their preference.) What is the best strategy for finding
the best overall photo? Keep in mind that humans can make mistakes, so we may need to perform the
same comparison multiple times. As a first step, should we compare all pairs of photos? Or only some
pairs, and based on the results, compare additional pairs? Should we try to figure out which humans
are more reliable, so we can weight their votes more? We are addressing these types of questions for
several tasks (e.g., sorting, finding the top-k elements, classification, etc). Again, a report is being written
and will be posted soon. 


Electronic Commerce:


 Commerce is one of the principal uses of the Web, so we have also been exploring how people buy and
sell products or information electronically. Here are two examples of our work. You are probably all
familiar with advertising by search engines: You type in the query "digital camera" and in addition to
your results, you get "sponsored links" (at the top of the results or on the right) for different stores and
camera manufacturers. We call this input bidding since the advertisers bid on your input (the query).
The more an advertiser bids, the more likely he is to win the auction and have his ad shown on the
results page. Together with researchers at Yahoo, we have been exploring a complementary approach,
output bidding. Here the advertiser bids on URLs that appear on the results page. For example, an
advertiser may want his ad to appear whenever the search result includes the sites www.imdb.com
and en.wikipedia.org, instead of bidding on keywords that lead to these sites, e.g., movie titles, actor
names, and so on. We claim that output bidding is more compact than input bidding, e.g., fewer URL
are needed to represent the interests of an advertiser. But if you do not believe me, read this paper
"Output URL Bidding".


Another popular type of advertising is display advertising. Here "banner ads" appear at the top or side
of the page, whenever a page is visited. The choice of ad to display depends on the user visiting the
page. For instance, an advertiser may request that a particular ad be displayed whenever a young male
living in California visits a page at the New York Times. Advertisers are always interested in knowing if
their campaign is effective, that is, are people that see the ad more likely to buy their product or visit
their Web site. Again with Yahoo, we have been evaluating the effectiveness (lift) of campaigns, by
seeing if people who see an ad for X are then more likely to ask queries related to X. Furthermore, we
are exploring the influence of social networks: If person A sees the ad for X, and A send email to B, is
then B more likely to ask queries related to X? Is the social influence greater if A has more (or fewer)
friends? How long does the influence last? Horus after the ad is displayed? Or days? The answers to
questions like these are very important to Web companies and their advertisers, as they can determine
how much can be charged for advertisements (money that can then be used to provide free services
to others J). We try to answer some of these questions in 
"Display Advertising Impact: Search Lift and Social Influence".



Entity Resolution:

Entity Resolution (ER) is the process of matching information records (typically from different sources)
that may refer to the same real-world entity. Matching records are often merged into "composite"
records that reflect the aggregate information known about the entity. A current direction we are
pursuing is the relationship between ER and information privacy. As more of our sensitive data gets
exposed to a variety of merchants, health care providers, employers, social sites and so on, there is a
higher chance that an adversary can "connect the dots" and piece together our information, leading to
even more loss of privacy. For instance, suppose that Alice has a social networking profile with her name
and photo and a web homepage containing her name and address. An adversary Eve may be able to
link the profile and homepage to connect the photo and address of Alice and thus glean more personal
information. The better Eve is at linking the information, the more vulnerable is Alice's privacy. Thus
in order to gain DP, one must try to prevent important bits of information being resolved by ER. In the
paper "Managing Information Leakage" we study this problem and list a number of interesting open
problems in this area. Take a look!



Recommendations:

Several years ago a few InfoLab students built a social networking site for Stanford students,
CourseRank, which was quite successful. (CourseRank is now commercial, and runs at over
300 universities.) We used CourseRank as a testbed for our research, focusing on the course
recommendations aspect. See for example, 
"Recsplorer: Recommendation Algorithms based onPrecedence Mining". More recently, we were asked by the Communications of the ACM to write an
essay on current trends and future challenges for recommendation systems, given our CourseRank
experience. In the paper "Information Seeking: Convergence of Search, Recommendations and
Advertising", we argue that recommendation mechanisms are "converging" with search and advertising
mechanisms, and that we should really design all "information seeking" strategies in a unified way.
Not everyone agrees with our thesis; some say a unified mechanism for search, recommendations and
advertising would be too inefficient. What do you think??

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
