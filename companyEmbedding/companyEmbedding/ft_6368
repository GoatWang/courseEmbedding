Smart Thermostat Program Features Record Rebate to Help Consumers Cut
      Cooling Costs by 10-20%


CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 25, 2017--
      Amid the hottest time of the year, consumer advocates joined with
      Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) and the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC)
      Tuesday to make Chicago-area consumers aware that cooling an empty home,
      while they are away at work or on vacation, can cause summer energy
      bills to soar.
    

      Smart thermostats provide the easy solution to high seasonal bills, and
      this summer, northern Illinois consumers can take advantage of
      unprecedented rebates as part of one of the largest thermostat rebate
      programs in the country.
    

      The "One Million Smart Thermostats" initiative, launched in October
      2015, is a partnership between the utilities and the advocacy groups
      Environmental Law & Policy Center (ELPC) and Citizens Utility Board
      (CUB). Under this initiative smart thermostats are eligible for up to
      $150 in rebates offered by ComEd and other Illinois gas utilities for
      customers with WiFi, central air and a furnace. The rebates can help cut
      the cost of some of these smart devices by more than 50 percent, and
      give more control to northern Illinois consumers to save money by
      reducing wasteful energy use.
    

      The goal of the program this year is to double the adoption to 100,000
      smart thermostats in households across Illinois. To help create
      awareness and boost adoption, ComEd has launched an educational campaign
      and a new instant discount option for customers.
    

      “ComEd’s smart thermostat rebate initiative is one of the largest and
      most active programs in the nation, reducing up-front costs for our
      customers on a product that gives them more control and even greater
      savings over time. With just a few taps on a smart thermostat app,
      customers can manage their household temperature while away from home
      avoiding unnecessary energy use and costs," said ComEd President & CEO
      Anne Pramaggiore.
    

      Smart thermostats are WiFi-enabled devices that allow residents to
      easily control the heating and air conditioning settings through their
      smartphones, tablets, and computers. The technology is smart because it
      learns or adapts to user behavior over time and can generate energy
      savings with very little effort. Residents remain comfortable when home
      and save money on heating and cooling energy costs while away at work or
      on vacation.
    

      “Smart thermostats do the work for you – they adjust the temperature
      automatically when you’re not home," said Rob Kelter, senior attorney
      for ELPC. "We want even more customers to take advantage of the great
      technological innovation of smart thermostats and keep more money in
      their pockets.”
    

      CUB Executive Director David Kolata said smart thermostats can help
      consumers cut their cooling costs by an estimated 10 to 20 percent.
      “Smart thermostats prove just how easy and effective energy efficiency
      can be,” Kolata said. “The savings from these easy-to-use devices could
      be substantial—potentially cutting northern Illinois electric bills by
      millions of dollars. We urge ComEd customers to take advantage of the
      unprecedented discounts - available online and in stores- to buy a smart
      thermostat this summer.”
    

      “The best way for consumers to control their electric bills, and help
      the environment, is to reduce consumption,” said Brien J. Sheahan,
      Chairman of the ICC. “Smart thermostats give consumers greater control
      of, and visibility into, their energy use which promotes conservation
      and helps save money.”
    

      To make it easier for customers to redeem rebates, ComEd launched a new
      website, ComEdMarketplace.com,
      where customers can shop for smart thermostats and other top-rated
      energy products and take advantage of online instant rebates that reduce
      purchase costs.
    

ComEd officials said the smart thermostat program is part of one of the
      nation’s best-performing energy efficiency programs, saving consumers
      some $2.5 billion. The ComEd Energy Efficiency Program is about to get
      even better, thanks to the Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA), a bipartisan
      bill that passed the Illinois General Assembly late in 2016 and was
      signed into law by Gov. Bruce Rauner.
    

      In June, ComEd filed with the ICC a new Energy Efficiency Program, under
      FEJA. The law will double customer savings and reduce electricity use in
      Illinois by 21 percent by 2030.

Customer Questions & Answers








            Is this a one piece or two piece tub and do you have any photos of the back side of the tub
        

            Is this a one piece or two piece tub and do you have any photos of the back side of the tub
        
Asked by: Jer

            Hello Jer, my name is Tiffany with Kohler Co. I am happy to help answer the question about the Sunstruck bath. The bathing portion of the bath is dropped into an outer shell or shroud. The back of the bath is smooth similar to the front side. More pictures can be seen at Us.Kohler.com. Please search K-6369-0 to find more pictures of the Sunstruck bath. Thank you for choosing The Bold Look Of Kohler.

            what is a straight or fluted shroud?
        


Asked by: Diane

            Hello, my name is Heather with KOHLER Customer Service. I am happy to assist you with your bathtub question.
The difference between the straight apron and fluted apron is that the fluted apron on K-6369-0 has more of a curved look, while the straight apron on K-6368-0 does not have a curved appearance. To best view the difference I suggest visiting www.us.kohler.com and searching for these two models on our website to give you a better visual.
For additional assistance on this inquiry, please contact our Customer Care Center at 1-800-4KOHLER. (1-800-456-4537)

Thank you for choosing the Bold Look of KOHLER.

        Bathroom remodel
We just redid our master bath and I purchased this product thinking that anything from kohler was a high quality product. Boy was I wrong. The shroud is a total low quality piece of junk. The plumbling is very hard to install on a concrete floor. Please investigate before purchasing any freestanding tubs. I would recommend going more with cast iron with the legs. Looks beautiful but do not have confidence this is going to hold up. Very expensive for this quality. Be very careful!!!!

        Extremely Poor Quality
Very flimsy and overall impression of the quality of this tub is very disappointing. Like the review above I was very surprised Kohler would sell such a questionable tub and doubt the unit will last without problems in the near future.

This rug is good size for a bedroom or medium sized t.v. room. The red is bright and the rug is soft enough to sleep on.

                                                EU Directive 2011/65/EU restricts the use of the 6 substances below in the manufacture 
                                            of specified types of electrical equipment.

                                            Whilst this restriction does not legally apply to components, it is recognised that
                                            component “compliance” is relevant to many customers.

                                            RS definition of RoHS Compliance:
                                            

The product does not contain any of the restricted substances in concentrations
                                                    and applications banned by the Directive,
and for components, the product is capable of being worked on at the higher temperatures
                                                    required by lead–free soldering


                                        The restricted substances and maximum allowed concentrations in the homogenous material
                                        are, by weight:
