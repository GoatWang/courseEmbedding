Josh Silverman Joins Greylock Partners as EIR

By 
Reid Hoffman 


It is my pleasure to announce that Josh Silverman is joining Greylock Partners as an Executive-in-Residence. Josh has rapidly scaled and helped run some of the most innovative companies, including American Express, Skype, eBay and Evite, and will bring a wide set of skills and expertise to Greylock. He will wrap up his work as the President of Consumer Products and Services at American Express at the end of the year and will be officially joining Greylock in January 2016.
Greylock’s history with Josh runs deep. Back to the late 1990s, Josh was CEO and co-founder of Evite, which was one of David Sze’s first consumer Internet company investments. David joined the Evite board and they worked closely on scaling the company together (culminating in an acquisition by Barry Diller and IAC.) I first met Josh in 2000 when I was at PayPal and Josh was CEO of Evite. It was clear to me after my first conversation with Josh that I would always look for ways for us to work together.
Josh is a seasoned executive with a remarkable ability help companies get to scale quickly. After his time with Evite, Josh went on to join eBay. He had several executive roles with eBay, making his name initially by identifying the opportunity in the Online Classifieds space, and building a leading pan-European business in under two years. He also served as CEO of Shopping.com, which eBay had recently acquired.
In April 2008, Josh joined Skype, where he re-energized the then-flagging company. Under Josh’s leadership, Skype transitioned from being voice-centric to video, doubled its user base and tripled its revenue, expanded to mobile phones and TVs, and struck breakthrough partnerships with other leading companies, including Facebook and Verizon. Josh also led the spinout of Skype from eBay in November 2009 and stayed on the lead the company for another year following. Microsoft announced its acquisition of Skype for $8.5B a few months later.
We kept in the touch throughout the years and, in 2010, Josh joined Greylock for the first time as an Executive-in-Residence. He worked closely with companies in the Greylock portfolio, consulting on business strategy and growth.
Josh spotted the opportunity in financial services early on and joined AMEX at a pivotal time, with a mandate to ‘digitize the core’, launch new products and expand the relevance of the brand. After four years, Josh has made a great impact on the company, resulting in revenue and profit growth far ahead of the market for his business unit. Josh (and his team) drove a culture of innovation, introducing iconic new products for a broader range of customers, world-class CRM and digital marketing capabilities, and significantly accelerating its lending business.
Because of the global, networked age, technology companies need to outmaneuver more competitors than ever before. To do it, companies need to scale at lightning fast speed. Josh is the rare executive who knows how to do just this, and we know that during the time he spends with us at Greylock, he will be an asset to many of Greylock’s portfolio companies. His focus will be on helping the entrepreneurs in our portfolio think through the challenges of scaling, globalization, disruption, teamwork/culture and leadership.

Product Liability 


Description
Joshua Silverman is a product liability lawyer who fights to obtain compensation for his clients after personal injuries from a defective product. It is important in a product liability case that the faulty product, equipment, or machinery is preserved, as it critical to proving the liability of the manufacturer or seller of the defective product. Product liability actions include defective automobiles, workplace machinery, household products, and consumer goods.



View transcript


A products liability case is a case involving somebody who was injured
because of a product that they have either purchased or, somebody else was
using that caused them to sustain a very serious injury and that includes a
defective automobile, where, for example, the seat belts or the airbags
don't work properly. A medical device, if you go into surgery and the
medical device doesn't work properly, or even thinking about cribs and toys
and things that we presume are going to be safe for our children.

In a products liability case, one of the most important things is that
we've got to preserve the evidence from the beginning and that's why, I
always encourage people, if they think they've been injured by a defective
product, to call me promptly because if we don't have whatever it is that
caused the injury, we're probably not going to be able to make a case.
We've got to prove that it was defective. So, I encourage people to bring
them in to me or, I'll go out to them to secure the evidence and in many
cases, we'll rent a storage unit to secure it.

When you're selecting a products liability lawyer, the critical question
is, how long have you been handling products liability? Have you handled
cases similar to mine? In my practice, I've been dealing with products
liability cases since day one and we've handled cases involving defective
automobiles, defective baby products, defective medical devices, but we've
run the gamut on the types of products that have caused very serious
injuries to our client.

If you would like more information, what I would encourage you to do is to
give me a call and I'll be happy to discuss with you your situation at no
fee. Or from the website, you can click your questions to me and I'll get
back in touch with you promptly.
