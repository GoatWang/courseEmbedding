Michael Craig "Mike" Turpen (born November 10, 1949)[1] is an American lawyer and politician from Oklahoma. A member of the Democratic Party, Turpen served as the Chairman of the Oklahoma Democratic Party and as the Attorney General of Oklahoma from 1983 to 1987. After leaving the Attorney General's Office, Turpen entered private practice.
Turpen was appointed by Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry in 2009 to serve as member of the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. Turpen's nine-year term will expire in May 2018.
Biography[edit]
Mike Turpen was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he attended Tulsa Public Schools. After high school, Turpen attended and graduated from the University of Tulsa, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in history in 1972. In 1974, he received his Juris Doctorate Degree from the University of Tulsa College of Law. Following law school, Turpen moved to Muskogee, Oklahoma, where he joined the Muskogee Police Department as the Police Legal Advisor. He then joined the Muskogee County District Attorney's Office where he would serve as the Chief Prosecutor and then as the First Assistant District Attorney. In 1976, Turpen was elected, as a Democrat, as the District Attorney for Muskogee County. He served in that position until 1983.
In 1982, Turpen became the Democratic nominee for Attorney General of Oklahoma. Turpen defeated his Republican opponent and entered office in 1983. He served in that position until 1987 when he declined to seek reelection in order to run for Governor of Oklahoma in 1986. Though initially considered the front runner in the race to seek the Democratic Party's nomination, Turpen ultimately lost the nomination to darkhorse candidate David Walters. Walters, in turn, was defeated by former Republican Governor Henry Bellmon.
Since leaving public service in 1987, Turpen has been a partner in the law firm of Riggs, Abney, Neal, Turpen, Orbison and Lewis in Oklahoma City. In 2009, Turpen was appointed by Democratic Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry to serve as member of the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. Turpen's nine-year term will expire in May 2018.
2010 Oklahoma Hall of Fame inductees are: Kristin Chenoweth, Broken Arrow; Robert A. Hefner, III, Oklahoma City; Edward Keller, Tulsa; Judy Love, Oklahoma City; Michael C. Turpen, Oklahoma City; and Lew O. Ward, III, Enid. The honorees will be formally inducted to the Hall on Nov. 4 at the Cox Convention Center in Oklahoma City. Also in November, their portraits will be added to the Oklahoma Hall of Fame Gallery at the Gaylord-Pickens Oklahoma Heritage Museum. Their biographies, photos and fun facts will be accessed through touch screen computers in the same gallery.[2]

Turpen, Michael C.
Birth and Death Year | 1950 - PresentInduction Year | 2010Profession | Attorney/Civic LeaderOklahoma Connection | Mike was born and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Fun FactIn 1975, Turpen was selected by the Oklahoma Bar Association as Oklahoma's Outstanding Young Lawyer, and 10 years later he argued before the U.S. Supreme Court.  Quote "I think of Mike as the quintessential Oklahoman. He was raised in Tulsa, he was educated in Oklahoma and he has lived here all his life. And he is kind of the quintessential Oklahoma story because he was raised by a great family, they gave him strong values, strong character, strong support, but not much money. And he had to pretty well make it on his own in that respect."                                -Burns HargisPresident of Oklahoma State UniversityBio Michael C. Turpen was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, educated in Tulsa Public Schools and graduated from the University of Tulsa, earning degrees in history and law.

Following his service, he became a partner in the law firm Riggs, Abney, Neal, Turpen, Orbison and Lewis.  Politically active, Turpen has been instrumental in the support of candidates in the national arena as a fundraiser and ally.  He shares his political wit each week on the public affairs show “Flashpoint” on Oklahoma’s City NBC affiliate.  In 2004, the courtroom at the University of Tulsa College of Law was named the Price & Turpen Courtroom.  Turpen has received the Oklahoma Arts Council Governor’s Award for Community Service, University of Tulsa’s Outstanding Alumnus, National Foundation for the Improvement of Justice Award and Lyric Theatre’s John Kirkpatrick Award for chairing its successful $10 million capital campaign.

Over the course of my 26-plus year career, I have clerked with a federal judge, been a partner at an AmLaw200 law firm, operated a litigation finance company, and managed a solo practice, all of which occurred in my native state of North Carolina. In April, 2010, I went on a guided fly fishing trip below Tellico Dam, and, well, I was "hooked" on Colorado. Since then, I have stood in many rivers and floated on many lakes and ponds, all the while absorbing the environment and the natural resources that surrounded me. Although I have had an interesting and successful career, I have always hungered for an area of the law about which I could truly be passionate. In November, 2012, divine intervention directed me to the Master of Laws in Natural Resources and Environmental Law and Policy program at the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law. I am now working toward serving my passion - natural resources - in a state I love - Colorado. Meanwhile, Riggs Abney has given me the opportunity to serve another area of the law that my "big firm" legal career did not: ordinary people and the ordinary issues that their life events create. I now know that my passion for the law requires me to serve people and the environment in which we live. Passion

Lori’s interest in law was sparked by her involvement with “The Writer’s Exchange,” a literary critique group that met weekly in Greenwich Village. With a JD, she imagined, she could negotiate fairer contracts for the artists. Once in law school, however, her interest in fairness evolved into an impassioned quest for justice as she studied the concepts of criminal and constitutional law. Armed with her degree, she left The Village and joined the Bronx District Attorney’s Office where she scrutinized the efficacy of criminal complaints before advocating imprisonment for any citizen. That passion for justice accompanied her to Oklahoma where she found a law firm which embraced and celebrated that spirit.

What Mary knew about lawyers as a child, she learned from Perry Mason. From a child’s view, he was almost superhuman; calm, smart, and possessed of some magical talent that elicited the truth from everyone, right on cue by the end of the hour.
When she finally came to the law as an adult, she found no one with actual magic powers, but talented, committed and smart people. She discovered that when the practice of law appeared to be about developing and exerting power over others, it was a stressful, unsettling and unsatisfying pursuit. Then she found the Neighbor for Neighbor Legal Clinic and what life and the practice of law can be like in the pursuit of power for others, the use of the special license and skill of the law in service of others.

As a child Scott was greatly moved by Harper Lee’s book, “To Kill a Mockingbird,” and the songs of Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. These artists’ concepts of social justice helped shape his views of right and wrong, and influenced his decision to become an attorney. He interned with Riggs Abney during his legal studies and joined the firm after passing the bar. In his first case, he was able to help save a family’s home from foreclosure after finding a mistake their lender had made in their case.

Growing up, every time I left our house, my father would say to me: “Remember, who you are.” With every client I meet, letter I write, pleading I draft, telephone call I make, or presentation to a judge, I think about what my father instilled within me. Who I am, what I do, and how I treat others sum up my life and my practice.
