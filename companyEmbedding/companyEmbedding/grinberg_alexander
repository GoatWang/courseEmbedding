Method and devices for a sub-splenius / supra-levator scapulae surgical access technique



Patent number:  9622779
                                            

Abstract:  A novel posterolateral inter-muscular approach has been developed to access the cervical spine. The approach includes elevating the splenius capitis and trapezios muscles dorsally to create a window for deep spine access, wherein the window comprises  i) an anterior superior border of the trapezius muscle; ii) an anterior inferior border of the splenius capitis muscle, and iii) a posterior superior border of the levator scapulae muscle.  Preferably, a device such as an implant or an instrument is then passed through the window to manipulate the spine.

Resilient bone plate and screw system allowing bi-directional assembly



Patent number:  9351774
                                            

Abstract:  Bone screws and bone plates are provided that offer the surgeon the ability to either assemble the screws to the plate, or the plate to the screws, depending on the surgeon's preference and the patient's circumstances. The bone screws and bone plates of the present invention include a combination of geometric configurations that allow the screws and plates to fit together from different assembly directions. Additionally, the bone screws and bone plates can include material resilience features to allow expansion/contraction during assembly to allow bidirectional attachment to one another.

REVISABLE ORTHOPEDIC ANCHOR AND METHODS OF USE



Publication number:  20160008033
                                            

Abstract:  A revisable orthopedic anchor and method of use for removably securing an anchor in bone, such as compromised or degenerated bone, is described herein. In one embodiment, the anchor makes use of dual probes and vector divergence of the distal tips of the probes to achieve superior bone purchase and pull-out resistance. In such an embodiment, the probes can be inserted one at a time into a hole formed in, for example, the pedicle bone. After the probes are inserted and joined at the proximal end, they have a greater pull-out resistance than a threaded anchor. Removing the anchor involves separating the proximal heads and reversing the implantation process. As a result of the unique bone anchor design disclosed herein, the devices and methods of the present invention allow for less complicated implantation and removal of orthopedic anchors, all while providing enhanced bone purchase when implanted in a patient.

Medical installation tool



Patent number:  RE45639
                                            

Abstract:  An installation tool that is useful for the efficient and effective placement of an article, such as an artificial disc, between adjacent vertebral bodies is provided. The installation tool can be provided as a kit having modular components which allow the surgeon to select from among a variety of components to assemble an installation tool that is optimized for its intended use. The installation tool of the invention generally includes a pair of opposed levers, each of which has a proximal handle portion and a distal portion. A fulcrum is disposed between the two levers to enable proper operation of the tool. The tool further includes a pusher block that is positioned between the two levers and is selectively movable between an initial location distal of the fulcrum and a final location adjacent the distal end of the levers. The pusher block includes a proximal end, a distal end, and a bore extending at least partially therethrough.
