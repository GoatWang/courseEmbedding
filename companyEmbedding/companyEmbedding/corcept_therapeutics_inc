Is It Too Late to Get In on This Millionaire-Maker Stock?
Corcept Therapeutics stock has skyrocketed, but are the biggest moves already over? 











                Keith Speights
            

                (TMFFishBiz)



            
            Jul 16, 2017 at 6:42AM
            
            





Corcept Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CORT) is one hot biotech stock no matter how you look at it. Shares have nearly quintupled in value in just three years. So far in 2017, Corcept stock is up around 70%.
Those kinds of returns could make millionaires out of some investors if the momentum continues. But is it too late to buy Corcept stock now? Here are the arguments for both answers to this question.

Negative Nellies
If you pay attention to what Wall Street thinks, the verdict is split on Corcept Therapeutics. Half of the analysts covering the biotech have a "buy" or "strong buy" rating for the stock. The other half of the analysts have an "underperform" or "sell" rating.
Why would half of these Wall Street analysts have a negative view of the biotech? We can know for sure why at least one of them doesn't view the stock in a favorable light.
In April, a Janney Montgomery Scott analyst reiterated a sell rating for Corcept over concerns that the company is too dependent on Cushing's syndrome drug Korlym and has a weak pipeline. There's no disputing that Corcept relies on Korlym -- it's the biotech's only approved drug, after all.  
What about Corcept's pipeline? It's also true that the company isn't likely to have another approved drug for quite a while. Corcept does have three candidates in its pipeline. Two of them, however, are only in pre-clinical testing. CORT125134 is being evaluated in a couple of phase 2 studies, one for treating Cushing's syndrome and the other in combination with Celgene's (NASDAQ: CELG) Abraxane in treating solid tumors.
Some might simply think that Corcept stock has become overvalued. Shares currently trade at 24 times expected earnings. That's more expensive than many biotechs with multiple blockbuster drugs already on the market.
There's also the threat of competition. Novartis (NYSE:NVS) already has a Cushing's disease drug on the market and is developing a new drug, osilodrostat, that could be more effective. The Swiss drugmaker is evaluating osilodrostat in a phase 3 study for treatment of Cushing's disease and in a phase 2 study for treatment of Cushing's syndrome. 
Stonebridge Biopharma (NASDAQ:SBBP) also could have a rival to Korlym on the way. The biotech is evaluating Recorlev in a late-stage study for treating Cushing's syndrome.

Eternal optimists
But why do the other half of Wall Street analysts like Corcept? For one thing, the company has already proven the pessimism to be wrong to some extent.
Corcept posted great numbers in its first-quarter results. They were so good, in fact, that the biotech raised its full-year 2017 revenue guidance. It's important to understand why sales for Korlym were strong. A major factor is that physicians are prescribing the drug more for less severe cases of hypercortisolism.  
In large part because of this trend, the consensus is that Corcept will be able to grow earnings by more than 50% annually over the next five years. That level of growth puts the biotech's stock valuation in an entirely different light. Corcept's PEG ratio is only 0.84. Legendary investor Peter Lynch would be the first to tell you that a stock with a PEG ratio that low is a bargain.
Furthermore, there's reason to be optimistic about Corcept's pipeline. CORT125134 holds the potential to be just as effective at treating Cushing's syndrome as Korlym is but without some of Korlym's negative side effects. That should be important in defending market share from potential rival drugs that could be on the way from Novartis and Stonebridge Biopharma. Results from the phase 2 study are expected by the end of this year. 





Too late?
Is it too late to buy Corcept stock or can investors still jump on board? I'll side with the optimists.
Granted, it's entirely possible that earnings growth estimates for the biotech could prove to be too high. Even with sales for Korlym continuing to increase rapidly, Corcept will spend more on development as it advances its pre-clinical drugs into phase 1 studies.
Still, I like the prospects for both Corcept and Korlym. As for the negative Nellies, I'd just note that the average one-year price target for Corcept stock is $11 per share. Corcept has traded above that level for most of the past two months.

Corcept Therapeutics Focuses on Korlym's Label Expansion


July 13, 2017, 05:44:00 PM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 We issued an updated research report on Corcept Therapeutics Inc. CORT  on Jul 12. Corcept's shares have surged 71.2% year to date, comparing favorably with the Zacks classified Medical-Drugs  industry's gain of 6.3%.    Currently, the company is striving to commercialize Korlym (mifepristone) successfully by deploying medical liaisons and sales representatives. In fact, Korlym  is its only marketed drug, which is approved for the treatment of patients with Cushing's syndrome. Notably, about 10-15 of every 1 million people are newly diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome each year, resulting into more than 3,000 new patients annually in the U.S. Therefore, we believe increased awareness among physicians and patients about the drug and expanded sales efforts should boost sales, going forward. Corcept is currently working on developing the drug for additional indications. It is conducting a phase I/II safety and efficacy study on Korlym in combination with Eisai Co., Ltd.'s anti-cancer drug, Halaven, for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Enrolment in the study is complete and the company announced encouraging data in Dec 2016. We expect a successful label expansion of Korlym to boost the top line significantly, as the disease represents huge potential with as many as 40,000 women in the U.S. being diagnosed every year. Moreover, the University of Chicago is conducting a phase II study on Korlym, in combination with Pfizer's PFE  Xtandi, for the treatment of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. The institution also plans to conduct a phase II study on Korlym, in combination with Celgene's CELG  Abraxane, for the treatment of patients with TNBC. Importantly, apart from Korlym, Corcept is also evaluating CORT125134 for Cushing's syndrome and a range of solid tumors. Early data on the candidate for Cushing's syndrome has been quite promising. The company has begun dosing patients in a phase I/II study on CORT125134, in combination with Abraxane, for the treatment of a range of solid-tumor cancers. The possible target indications include triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and sarcoma. The company expects open expansion cohorts by the end of 2017. Additionally, the company has three promising preclinical candidates - CORT118335 (metabolic disorders), CORT122928 (alcohol withdrawal) and CORT125281 (castration-resistant prostate cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and ovarian cancer) - which are expected to enter the clinic in 2017. Also, during its first quarter 2017 earnings release, the company raised its 2017 revenue guidance. Now, Corcept projects revenues to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million more than its prior expectation of $120 million to $130 million.

Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated in 3 Charts
Corcept has been one of the best-performing drug stocks this year. These charts show why the good times could continue.











                Keith Speights
            

                (TMFFishBiz)



            
            Jun 26, 2017 at 8:43AM
            
            





Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (NASDAQ:CORT) is definitely on a roll. The drugmaker's stock is up nearly 70% so far in 2017. Corcept's share price has has more than doubled over the past 12 months. And over the last three years, the company's market cap has nearly quadrupled.
What's behind Corcept's tremendous performance? The following three charts show why the company has been so successful.

1. Impressive revenue and earnings trends
Since winning Food and Drug Administration approval in 2012 for Cushing's syndrome drug Korlym, Corcept's financial results have looked very good. Sales for Korlym have steadily increased, helping the company to become profitable last year.

CORT Revenue (Quarterly). Data by YCharts.
Corcept is by no means an overnight success, though. In 1998, the company began developing a compound to control the effects of cortisol in the body by acting as a competitive antagonist at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The effects of excess cortisol are severe and often life-threatening. That compound, mifepristone (later branded as Korlym), eventually proved to be both effective at controlling cortisol. 
2. Great expectations for earnings growth
Can Korlym continue to drive Corcept Therapeutics' earnings even higher? Wall Street analysts definitely think so.

Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Chart by author.

Corcept is expected to achieve tremendous earnings growth over the next few years. An estimated 20,000 Americans have Cushing's syndrome, with around 3,000 new patients diagnosed with the condition each year. However, a large number of of individuals who suffer from Cushing's syndrome remain undiagnosed. 
Korlym does have some competition, however. Novartis (NYSE:NVS) gained FDA approval in December 2012 for Signifor in treating Cushing's disease. Around 70% of patients with Cushing's syndrome have Cushing's disease. Novartis is also developing another drug, osilodrostat, targeting treatment of Cushing's disease.
Also, Strongbridge Biopharma (NASDAQ:SBBP) is evaluating Recorlev in a late-stage study for treating Cushing's syndrome. Preliminary results from this study should be on the way within the next few months.





3. Pipeline potential
Although an analyst from Janney Montgomery doesn't think highly of Corcept's pipeline, the company does have more possibilities than just Korlym. Corcept has a solid candidate with CORT125134 and a couple of experimental drugs that should advance to phase 1 clinical studies.

Data source: Corcept Therapeutics. Chart by author.

CORT125134 is a selective cortisol modulator. Corcept thinks that the drug could provide patients the same benefits as Korlym in treating Cushing's syndrome but without the side effects associated with Korlym's affinity for the progesterone receptor. 
Corcept is also conducting a phase 1/2 clinical study of CORT125134 with Celgene's (NASDAQ:CELG) Abraxane. This study is targeting solid tumors, including breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Although this study is being done without Celgene's collaboration, the big biotech is funding another study of Korlym in combination with Abraxane in treating breast cancer and prostate cancer. This other study is being led by researchers at the University of Chicago.
Robert Fishman, Corcept's chief medical officer, said in May that experimental drug CORT118335 will move forward to a phase 1 study as a potential treatment for metabolic disorders such as fatty liver disease and antipsychotic-induced weight gain. He also stated that CORT125281 will advance to a phase 1 study targeting castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
Looking ahead
The prospects for Corcept Therapeutics appear to be pretty good. Momentum for Korlym should continue. CORT125134 seems to have solid potential.
Investors should like Corcept's growth potential. My colleague Sean Williams recently noted that Corcept is one of the cheapest biotech stocks on the market based on its PEG ratio, which factors in estimated growth. I suspect that the stock still has plenty of room to run.

Cillian Murphy does not watch his movies a couple of times
21 Июля 2017


I think he's one of the best directors in the world so it's a privilege to work with people as talented as that.In a new interview with Shortlist, the Dunkirk actor discussed his unwilling influence on the hair craze, saying: "People like the undercut thing; people go to the barber and ask for a 'Peaky cut'". "I normally keep my hair long"."But they do realise the people in turtlenecks in Hackney (London) with this haircut, do they realise it was styled this way to prevent lice?"He's been playing Birmingham badboy Thomas Shelby in hit BBC drama Peaky Blinders since 2013, and is now filming the highly anticipated fourth season of the acclaimed series. "Tell 'em they have got the lice cut, see what they say then", he said.

No date has been set yet for the series, but it is believed it could be around October this year.As well as discussing the burden of having the coolest hair on TV, the 41-year-old also revealed that he isn't planning any repeat viewings of Dunkirk. I don't know anyone who pores over their work because the impulse is always the next - the next piece I do will be the best piece I do.Cillian can next be seen in Christopher Nolan's Second World War epic Dunkirk, where he plays a shell shocked soldier, alongside an all-star cast that includes his Peaky Blinders co-star Tom Hardy, Oscar victor Mark Rylance and One Direction star Harry Styles in his acting debut. I'll see it once. To an actor, nostalgia is death. "It's got to be forward thinking".

Corcept Products 







Korlym® (mifepristone) 300 mg Tablets
Korlym is a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist that is indicated to control hyperglycemia associated with Cushing's syndrome, a rare, debilitating endocrine disorder.  Cushing's syndrome is caused by prolonged exposure to elevated levels of glucocorticoids (hypercortisolism).  The potent metabolic effects of excess cortisol influence many tissues and body systems, and patients often have many problems, including diabetes, obesity, muscle wasting, depression, cognitive difficulties, and psychosis.
Korlym was launched in April 2012, and was the first FDA-approved oral therapy for the treatment of patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome.
Additional information about Korlym for patients and prescribers is available on korlym.com.
Indications and Usage
Korlym (mifepristone) is a cortisol receptor blocker indicated to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery.
Important Limitations of Use
Do not use for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus unrelated to endogenous Cushing's syndrome.
WARNING: TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY

Mifepristone is a potent antagonist of progesterone and cortisol via the progesterone and glucocorticoid (GR-II) receptors, respectively. The antiprogestational effects will result in the termination of pregnancy. Pregnancy must therefore be excluded before the initiation of treatment with Korlym and prevented during treatment and for one month after stopping treatment by the use of a non-hormonal medically acceptable method of contraception unless the patient has had a surgical sterilization, in which case no additional contraception is needed. Pregnancy must also be excluded if treatment is interrupted for more than 14 days in females of reproductive potential.
Please see Full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide.

Research 







Corcept’s Research & Development Program
Evidence in the scientific literature suggests that competitive blockade of one of the body’s two glucocorticoid receptors (GR) may have utility in treating a wide range of conditions, including Cushing’s syndrome, prostate, breast and ovarian cancer, anti-psychotic drug induced weight gain, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, Alzheimer’s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism.
Corcept is the leading company investigating the potential therapeutic benefit of competitive GR blockade.  Mifepristone, the active ingredient in our marketed product, blocks GR and the progesterone receptors.  We have now developed a library of more than 300 next-generation compounds that competitively block only GR, and have begun advancing several of these compounds toward human use.

Compassionate Use (Expanded Access)Cushing's Syndrome
Prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol adversely affects multiple systems throughout the body
Cushing's syndrome is an endocrine disorder caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol.  Patients with Cushing's syndrome have multiple symptoms which may include high blood sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure, upper body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, thinning arms and legs, severe fatigue and weak muscles.  Irritability, anxiety, cognitive disturbances and depression are also common.  Cushing's syndrome can affect every organ system in the body and can be lethal if not treated effectively and early.  Blocking the glucocorticoid receptor can have significant results in many of these patients.

Treatments[edit]
Corcept Therapeutics Inc. has developed treatments mainly focusing on solving metabolic disorders and related problems, and have several experimental and on-sale drugs released.[3]
Type II diabetes[edit]
One of the principle drugs that the company has been developing is Korlym, which is an oral daily medication for patients with type II diabetes mellitus or glutose intolerance, and those who failed or might not tolerate surgery. In 2013, after being offered since 2012 in the US, the drug was further commercialized to the market outside the States and reached the global medical field, since the company's partnership with Idis Access Program was approved and launched.[4] This is the first therapy approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome.[5]
Psychotic depression[edit]
From 1998, the company has been studying the psychotic features of depression and developing oral medication for the symptoms. In recent years, two of the main trials were conducted with the drug CORLUX, which is a once-daily treatment given to patients, mainly in the United States.[6]
Other metabolic disorders[edit]
The company has also been studying treatment for other metabolic disorders. In April 2005, results of two preclinical studies were announced by the company, demonstrating an effect that can prevent weight gain associated with treatment with olanzapine.[7]
In December 2013, the company announced plans to extend its development program for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists, including mifepristone, into oncology.[8]
Patent rights[edit]
In December 2013, Corcept Therapeutics Inc. licensed patent rights with the University of Chicago's Center for Technology Development & Ventures, and started investigating new drug application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).[9]

Treatments[edit]
Corcept Therapeutics Inc. has developed treatments mainly focusing on solving metabolic disorders and related problems, and have several experimental and on-sale drugs released.[3]
Type II diabetes[edit]
One of the principle drugs that the company has been developing is Korlym, which is an oral daily medication for patients with type II diabetes mellitus or glutose intolerance, and those who failed or might not tolerate surgery. In 2013, after being offered since 2012 in the US, the drug was further commercialized to the market outside the States and reached the global medical field, since the company's partnership with Idis Access Program was approved and launched.[4] This is the first therapy approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome.[5]
Psychotic depression[edit]
From 1998, the company has been studying the psychotic features of depression and developing oral medication for the symptoms. In recent years, two of the main trials were conducted with the drug CORLUX, which is a once-daily treatment given to patients, mainly in the United States.[6]
Other metabolic disorders[edit]
The company has also been studying treatment for other metabolic disorders. In April 2005, results of two preclinical studies were announced by the company, demonstrating an effect that can prevent weight gain associated with treatment with olanzapine.[7]
In December 2013, the company announced plans to extend its development program for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists, including mifepristone, into oncology.[8]
Patent rights[edit]
In December 2013, Corcept Therapeutics Inc. licensed patent rights with the University of Chicago's Center for Technology Development & Ventures, and started investigating new drug application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).[9]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  112.14 (07/24/17)      EPS (TTM)  $0.11      Market Cap $1.47 B     Shares Outstanding 113.19 M     Public Float 96.67 M     Yield CORT has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (06/30/17)    Shares Sold Short 8.21 M     Change from Last  10.93%      Percent of Float 8.49%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.97      Net Money Flow ($)  -83,697    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
