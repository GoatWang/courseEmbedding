Rick is very detail oriented.  He is able to learn things extremely quickly and apply this knowledge to great depths in the projects that he is assigned.  I always appreciated Rick's willingness to share information and work together on any projects we were assigned.  Any manager would do well to give Rick an opportunity to work within their organization.See moreSee lessWhen I needed specific information about the Change Notice (CN) System to write a custom database query that needed CN data, Rick was able to provide examples, places to search, and business rules that were in play and not present in anywhere else, so I could write queries for a system foreign to me.  His assistance was valuable and provided me what I needed so I could meet my customers needs.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended RichardGroupsAuto OEM Network - World's Largest Automotive GroupAutomotive Management ProfessionalsBoy Scouts of America - Great Lakes Council - Metro Detroit AreaView Richard’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Richard directlyView Richard’s Full ProfileNot the Richard you’re looking for?
