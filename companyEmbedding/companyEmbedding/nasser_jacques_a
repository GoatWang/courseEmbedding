Early life and education[edit]
Jacques "Jac" A. Nasser was born in the city of Amyoun,[7] Lebanon[8] on 27 December 1947.[7] He is the son of a bus driver[9] and independent businessman, Abdo Nasser,[7] who served with the Australian armed forces in Lebanon during the second world war.[citation needed][10] At four years of age Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia.[3] He attended Northcote High School. He started a number of businesses as a teenager, including a bicycle-making operation[7] and several discotheques,[7] which he promoted in Melbourne[1] with his brother Jamie.[9] Nasser's first professional experience was at Ford of Australia as a student intern.[7] He graduated with a business degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1968,[11][7] where he would later be awarded with an honorary doctorate of technology.[12] He speaks four languages:[13] English, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese.[12]
Business career[edit]
Early Ford positions (1968–1997)[edit]
See also: Ford Motor Company
Upon graduating,[7] in 1968 the 20-year-old Nasser joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst,[3] working at the head office in Australia.[14] In 1973 he joined Ford's global financial staff and transferred to Ford's North American Truck Operations in the United States.[3] Afterwards, he returned to Australia to work as a manager of product programming and financial analysis, before joining Ford's International Automotive Operations.[3] While with the international division, he helped oversee Asia-Pacific and Latin American operations.[7] While working in Argentina, Nasser was notably kidnapped by political extremists, being returned to the Ford plant two days later.[11]
Nasser helped in the negotiations of Ford's South African joint venture program in 1982.[12] The following year, he developed a business and operating plan for Ford's Hermosillo Assembly Plant in Mexico.[12] In 1987 Nasser became the first director and vice president of Autolatina,[12] a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina.[3][7]
While remaining in charge of Autolatina,[3] in 1989 he also took charge of Ford Australia, where he had started his career.[14] He remained president and CEO of Ford Australia until 1993,[7] where he picked up the corporate nicknames "Jac the Knife" for costcutting[14] efforts with Ford's supplier base.[15] He was also dubbed "Black Jack" for his ability to keep numbers north of red.[13] On 1 January 1993, Nasser was elected chairman of the board of Ford Europe,[12] a role he maintained until 1996.[7] He was promoted to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993 as well,[12][3] becoming Ford's group vice president of product development in 1994.[3] While in his position of Ford's VP, Fortune writes that he developed a reputation for working 18 hour days and regularly interacting with Ford employees via a newsletter. Wrote Fortune about his time as VP, "if Ford is a religion, then Nasser is the head preacher."[13]
VP and CEO appointments (1996–1999)[edit]
On 1 November 1996,[12] he began heading Ford Automotive Operations.[15] Nasser was the featured speaker at the 1998 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS).[12] Bloomberg Businessweek described Nasser in late 1998 as a "scrappy, hard-nosed cost-cutter who is widely credited with Ford's turnaround." The magazine further opined that since becoming Ford's automotive president in October 1996, "the blunt-talking Australian has transformed Ford from struggling with the worst profit margins in the business to scoring record earnings last year - surpassing General Motors. Nasser has slashed over $4 billion in costs in the past 18 months... and this fall he will show a further 10% of Ford's 53,000 salaried staff the door. Nasser also has a flair for car design and has reinvigorated Ford's overseas operations."[16]
Fortune in June 1998 described Nasser as "heir apparent" to Ford CEO Alex Trotman, who was soon to retire.[13] The projected high-profile appointment met with a great deal of attention in the press, and largely positive reactions.[13] Before the role was finalized, Robert A. Lutz of Chrysler categorized Nasser as a "brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker" and opined "they'd be crazy not to give him the top job."[7] The president of BMW North America stated Nasser had energy and ideas but had "to avoid diluting Ford's brands-but I suspect he understands that."[13] On 1 January 1999,[16] Nasser became president and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan.[17] At the time Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment by the simultaneously appointed chairman Bill Ford.[18] Nasser announced that he would transform Ford, according to The Economist, "from a boring old car maker" into a "consumer-products and services company".[19] He stated he would work to help Ford surpass GM in US market share, and would also try to make Ford less reliant on pickup truck sales.[13]
Initial changes at Ford (1999)[edit]
See also: Premier Automotive Group
Nasser promptly instituted a number of changes as CEO, closing plants that were losing money and selling unprofitable operations. He also instituted a new human resources policy[7] mandating that 10 percent of low-performing managers could be subject to termination, arguing that new people and turnover were good for the company.[7][20] He also instituted a program that gave internet access and home computers to employees.[7] Beyond human resources, Nasser's other focus was brand management,[19] and under Nasser's watch, in 1999 Ford formed Premier Automotive Group (PAG) to expand its market share in the luxury segment.[21][15] PAG was formed to oversee the business operations of Ford's high-end automotive marques,[22] and it grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands.[23] To reinvigorate certain brand lines, Nasser brought in car designer J Mays.[18] He also oversaw Ford's 1999 acquisition of Volvo for $6.45 billion, LandRover for $2.8 billion, and helped Ford start an "automotive e-business integrated supply chain."[24][25][26]
He diversified Ford's businesses to include e-commerce, junkyards, auto-repair shops,[18] and car distribution among others.[21][15] By August 1999, The Economist clarified that Nasser had already acquired the Kwik-Fit exhausts-and-brakes chain in Europe, American scrapyard businesses, the consumer-finance arm of Japan's Mazda, and had "even signed a deal to provide drivers with satellite-fed audio and other services for a monthly fee." The Economist pointed out the diversification was an attempt to increase profit margins, as "whereas car makers are lucky to scrape operating margins of more than 5% from actually making cars, other businesses such as leasing, renting, insurance, finance and car repair, can all achieve margins of 10-15%."[19] Also, by late 1999 Nasser was working to sell the underperforming in-house parts company, Visteon.[19] Ford of North America began marketing the Ford Focus in October 1999 for the 2000 model year as a surprise Christmas present for Nasser, with some changes from the European version.[27] Ford's profits in 1999 were USD $6.5 billion ($A9.94 billion), which Drive.com claims was the largest "ever made in the world car industry."[14]
Disputes and Firestone (2000–2001)[edit]
According to CNN, Nasser was "point man" in the dispute between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety.[15] After an investigation in early 2000 found that tread separation on Firestone tires[15] had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers,[22] Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall[22] allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others.[28] Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer as one of the safer SUVs on the market.[29] On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub-committee on the recall.[22] Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault.[22] On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, aruging Ford's tire recall was "casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires."[30] After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year,[31] with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion[14] of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles.[15] The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices.[14]
By late 2001, Nasser's efforts to diversify Ford's core business had met with mixed reactions in the press,[21][15] with analysts at The Economist and CNN arguing that diversification and recent recalls had hampered productivity.[21][15] Nasser's manager evaluation system had also proved controversial at Ford,[7] with allegations of reverse discrimination.[32] In July 2001, Nasser announced that the system was being changed[33] to "allow for more flexibility."[33] Ford settled several lawsuits over the system in late 2001 without admitting liability.[32] In October 2001,[24] the 53-year-old Nasser[14] retired from his position as Ford's CEO.[24] He was succeeded in both positions by William Clay Ford Jr,[24] who as Henry Ford's great-grandson had previously been chairman[16] and president.[14]
Recent positions (2010–present)[edit]
See also: BHP Billiton
In February 2001, Nasser became a member of the International Advisory Council of Allianz Aktiengeselischaft.[17] The following year he became a senior partner at One Equity Partners,[7] the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. Nasser was involved in 2006 when One Equity speculated on bidding for Jaguar Cars and Premier Automotive Group. [34] He also would serve as chairman of One Equity's Polaroid Corporation subsidiary[34] starting in July 2002,[7] before selling the company in 2005.[3] He remained a One Equity partner until 2014.[17] Nasser was on the board of British Sky Broadcasting from November 2002 to November 2012[17] and he served on the board of BuyTV.com.[7] In 2004, he began a four-year tenure on the board of directors at Brambles Limited, an Australian logistics company. In June 2006 he was appointed to the board the Australian mining company BHP Billiton, specifically BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc.[17]
He was elected as the next chairman of BHP Billiton in March 2010,[35] ending an 18-month search[36] to find a replacement for the retiring Don Argus.[37] The Wall Street Journal claimed that "analysts welcomed the appointment," and that Nasser had possibly been selected because BHP was "looking for the stability of another long-term chairman."[38] The Australian opined the next day that Nasser was "the right guy to lead BHP Billiton in the post-Argus era,"[9] writing about his time at Ford that "Nasser spent a good 15 years delivering Ford, with some internal reluctance, leadership of the reform agenda in the motor industry...Nasser is one reason why Ford is the one US major not to put its hand out for government money in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis."[9] He officially became chairman of BHP Billiton[17] on 13 March 2010.[17] Over the following years Nasser would help implement a number of policy changes at BHP, including a large demerger and a cap on growth projects.[2] Nasser also focused on maintaining the company's long-term financial goals, working to keep the balance sheet stable during a global downturn in the metals and oil markets, and revising the company's progressive annual dividend policy,[39] which The Australian Financial Review dubbed strategic for the "new era."[40]
On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the "most powerful people in Australian boardrooms."[1] At the time, Nasser ranked No. 18 on the Optimice Market Capitalisation Influence Index and at No. 17 on the MCII connectedness index.[1] He became a board member at 21st Century Fox in June 2013.[17] On 2 August 2015, it was confirmed that Nasser had joined the board of Koç Holding [2][17] a large Turkey-based conglomerate.[2] After the deadly Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil on 5 November 2015,[41] Nasser announced that BHP would be permitting an external investigation into the incident, with findings to be released publicly.[42]
In June 2017, BHP annonced that Nasser will be replaced by Ken MacKenzie as chairman effective on 1 September 2017.[43][44]
Honors and philanthropy[edit]
Nasser was named 'Automobile Industries Man of the Year' in 1999 by the Retail Motor Industry Organization.[7] In 2002[7] he was named an officer[4] of the National Order of the Cedar,[3] the highest honor in Lebanon.[4] Also that year Nasser[7] was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal for "his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology."[3] The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Nasser the Ellis Island Medal of Honor,[3] which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants.[5]
Nasser funds several scholarship programs[6] that assist individual students, including the Jacques Nasser Scholarship in Entrepreneurship at RMIT University in Melbourne, the Jacques Nasser Scholarship for MBA students at the American University of Beirut, and the Jacques Nasser Scholarship at the INSEAD School of Business.[3][third-party source needed] He also has been known to support organizations such as Focus: HOPE, a training center in Detroit.[3][third-party source needed]
Personal life[edit]
Nasser and his ex-wife Jennifer,[13] also an Australian,[7] married in 1970[13] and have four children together.[3][14] By 2009[38] Nasser was based primarily out of his home in Michigan,[1] though after becoming chairman of BHP Billiton[38] in 2010 he began spending equal time in Australia,[9] also having properties in New York City, London, and Melbourne. Described as a fan of racing,[13] Nasser has served as a periodic judge at Concours d'Elegance events.[45]
He has Australian-American dual citizenship, and is nicknamed "Jac".[11] He owns a 1961 Lincoln Continental. He has a sister named Betty.[46]

Early life and education[edit]
Jacques "Jac" A. Nasser was born in the city of Amyoun,[7] Lebanon[8] on 27 December 1947.[7] He is the son of a bus driver[9] and independent businessman, Abdo Nasser,[7] who served with the Australian armed forces in Lebanon during the second world war.[citation needed][10] At four years of age Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia.[3] He attended Northcote High School. He started a number of businesses as a teenager, including a bicycle-making operation[7] and several discotheques,[7] which he promoted in Melbourne[1] with his brother Jamie.[9] Nasser's first professional experience was at Ford of Australia as a student intern.[7] He graduated with a business degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1968,[11][7] where he would later be awarded with an honorary doctorate of technology.[12] He speaks four languages:[13] English, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese.[12]
Business career[edit]
Early Ford positions (1968–1997)[edit]
See also: Ford Motor Company
Upon graduating,[7] in 1968 the 20-year-old Nasser joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst,[3] working at the head office in Australia.[14] In 1973 he joined Ford's global financial staff and transferred to Ford's North American Truck Operations in the United States.[3] Afterwards, he returned to Australia to work as a manager of product programming and financial analysis, before joining Ford's International Automotive Operations.[3] While with the international division, he helped oversee Asia-Pacific and Latin American operations.[7] While working in Argentina, Nasser was notably kidnapped by political extremists, being returned to the Ford plant two days later.[11]
Nasser helped in the negotiations of Ford's South African joint venture program in 1982.[12] The following year, he developed a business and operating plan for Ford's Hermosillo Assembly Plant in Mexico.[12] In 1987 Nasser became the first director and vice president of Autolatina,[12] a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina.[3][7]
While remaining in charge of Autolatina,[3] in 1989 he also took charge of Ford Australia, where he had started his career.[14] He remained president and CEO of Ford Australia until 1993,[7] where he picked up the corporate nicknames "Jac the Knife" for costcutting[14] efforts with Ford's supplier base.[15] He was also dubbed "Black Jack" for his ability to keep numbers north of red.[13] On 1 January 1993, Nasser was elected chairman of the board of Ford Europe,[12] a role he maintained until 1996.[7] He was promoted to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993 as well,[12][3] becoming Ford's group vice president of product development in 1994.[3] While in his position of Ford's VP, Fortune writes that he developed a reputation for working 18 hour days and regularly interacting with Ford employees via a newsletter. Wrote Fortune about his time as VP, "if Ford is a religion, then Nasser is the head preacher."[13]
VP and CEO appointments (1996–1999)[edit]
On 1 November 1996,[12] he began heading Ford Automotive Operations.[15] Nasser was the featured speaker at the 1998 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS).[12] Bloomberg Businessweek described Nasser in late 1998 as a "scrappy, hard-nosed cost-cutter who is widely credited with Ford's turnaround." The magazine further opined that since becoming Ford's automotive president in October 1996, "the blunt-talking Australian has transformed Ford from struggling with the worst profit margins in the business to scoring record earnings last year - surpassing General Motors. Nasser has slashed over $4 billion in costs in the past 18 months... and this fall he will show a further 10% of Ford's 53,000 salaried staff the door. Nasser also has a flair for car design and has reinvigorated Ford's overseas operations."[16]
Fortune in June 1998 described Nasser as "heir apparent" to Ford CEO Alex Trotman, who was soon to retire.[13] The projected high-profile appointment met with a great deal of attention in the press, and largely positive reactions.[13] Before the role was finalized, Robert A. Lutz of Chrysler categorized Nasser as a "brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker" and opined "they'd be crazy not to give him the top job."[7] The president of BMW North America stated Nasser had energy and ideas but had "to avoid diluting Ford's brands-but I suspect he understands that."[13] On 1 January 1999,[16] Nasser became president and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan.[17] At the time Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment by the simultaneously appointed chairman Bill Ford.[18] Nasser announced that he would transform Ford, according to The Economist, "from a boring old car maker" into a "consumer-products and services company".[19] He stated he would work to help Ford surpass GM in US market share, and would also try to make Ford less reliant on pickup truck sales.[13]
Initial changes at Ford (1999)[edit]
See also: Premier Automotive Group
Nasser promptly instituted a number of changes as CEO, closing plants that were losing money and selling unprofitable operations. He also instituted a new human resources policy[7] mandating that 10 percent of low-performing managers could be subject to termination, arguing that new people and turnover were good for the company.[7][20] He also instituted a program that gave internet access and home computers to employees.[7] Beyond human resources, Nasser's other focus was brand management,[19] and under Nasser's watch, in 1999 Ford formed Premier Automotive Group (PAG) to expand its market share in the luxury segment.[21][15] PAG was formed to oversee the business operations of Ford's high-end automotive marques,[22] and it grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands.[23] To reinvigorate certain brand lines, Nasser brought in car designer J Mays.[18] He also oversaw Ford's 1999 acquisition of Volvo for $6.45 billion, LandRover for $2.8 billion, and helped Ford start an "automotive e-business integrated supply chain."[24][25][26]
He diversified Ford's businesses to include e-commerce, junkyards, auto-repair shops,[18] and car distribution among others.[21][15] By August 1999, The Economist clarified that Nasser had already acquired the Kwik-Fit exhausts-and-brakes chain in Europe, American scrapyard businesses, the consumer-finance arm of Japan's Mazda, and had "even signed a deal to provide drivers with satellite-fed audio and other services for a monthly fee." The Economist pointed out the diversification was an attempt to increase profit margins, as "whereas car makers are lucky to scrape operating margins of more than 5% from actually making cars, other businesses such as leasing, renting, insurance, finance and car repair, can all achieve margins of 10-15%."[19] Also, by late 1999 Nasser was working to sell the underperforming in-house parts company, Visteon.[19] Ford of North America began marketing the Ford Focus in October 1999 for the 2000 model year as a surprise Christmas present for Nasser, with some changes from the European version.[27] Ford's profits in 1999 were USD $6.5 billion ($A9.94 billion), which Drive.com claims was the largest "ever made in the world car industry."[14]
Disputes and Firestone (2000–2001)[edit]
According to CNN, Nasser was "point man" in the dispute between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety.[15] After an investigation in early 2000 found that tread separation on Firestone tires[15] had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers,[22] Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall[22] allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others.[28] Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer as one of the safer SUVs on the market.[29] On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub-committee on the recall.[22] Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault.[22] On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, aruging Ford's tire recall was "casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires."[30] After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year,[31] with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion[14] of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles.[15] The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices.[14]
By late 2001, Nasser's efforts to diversify Ford's core business had met with mixed reactions in the press,[21][15] with analysts at The Economist and CNN arguing that diversification and recent recalls had hampered productivity.[21][15] Nasser's manager evaluation system had also proved controversial at Ford,[7] with allegations of reverse discrimination.[32] In July 2001, Nasser announced that the system was being changed[33] to "allow for more flexibility."[33] Ford settled several lawsuits over the system in late 2001 without admitting liability.[32] In October 2001,[24] the 53-year-old Nasser[14] retired from his position as Ford's CEO.[24] He was succeeded in both positions by William Clay Ford Jr,[24] who as Henry Ford's great-grandson had previously been chairman[16] and president.[14]
Recent positions (2010–present)[edit]
See also: BHP Billiton
In February 2001, Nasser became a member of the International Advisory Council of Allianz Aktiengeselischaft.[17] The following year he became a senior partner at One Equity Partners,[7] the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. Nasser was involved in 2006 when One Equity speculated on bidding for Jaguar Cars and Premier Automotive Group. [34] He also would serve as chairman of One Equity's Polaroid Corporation subsidiary[34] starting in July 2002,[7] before selling the company in 2005.[3] He remained a One Equity partner until 2014.[17] Nasser was on the board of British Sky Broadcasting from November 2002 to November 2012[17] and he served on the board of BuyTV.com.[7] In 2004, he began a four-year tenure on the board of directors at Brambles Limited, an Australian logistics company. In June 2006 he was appointed to the board the Australian mining company BHP Billiton, specifically BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc.[17]
He was elected as the next chairman of BHP Billiton in March 2010,[35] ending an 18-month search[36] to find a replacement for the retiring Don Argus.[37] The Wall Street Journal claimed that "analysts welcomed the appointment," and that Nasser had possibly been selected because BHP was "looking for the stability of another long-term chairman."[38] The Australian opined the next day that Nasser was "the right guy to lead BHP Billiton in the post-Argus era,"[9] writing about his time at Ford that "Nasser spent a good 15 years delivering Ford, with some internal reluctance, leadership of the reform agenda in the motor industry...Nasser is one reason why Ford is the one US major not to put its hand out for government money in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis."[9] He officially became chairman of BHP Billiton[17] on 13 March 2010.[17] Over the following years Nasser would help implement a number of policy changes at BHP, including a large demerger and a cap on growth projects.[2] Nasser also focused on maintaining the company's long-term financial goals, working to keep the balance sheet stable during a global downturn in the metals and oil markets, and revising the company's progressive annual dividend policy,[39] which The Australian Financial Review dubbed strategic for the "new era."[40]
On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the "most powerful people in Australian boardrooms."[1] At the time, Nasser ranked No. 18 on the Optimice Market Capitalisation Influence Index and at No. 17 on the MCII connectedness index.[1] He became a board member at 21st Century Fox in June 2013.[17] On 2 August 2015, it was confirmed that Nasser had joined the board of Koç Holding [2][17] a large Turkey-based conglomerate.[2] After the deadly Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil on 5 November 2015,[41] Nasser announced that BHP would be permitting an external investigation into the incident, with findings to be released publicly.[42]
In June 2017, BHP annonced that Nasser will be replaced by Ken MacKenzie as chairman effective on 1 September 2017.[43][44]
Honors and philanthropy[edit]
Nasser was named 'Automobile Industries Man of the Year' in 1999 by the Retail Motor Industry Organization.[7] In 2002[7] he was named an officer[4] of the National Order of the Cedar,[3] the highest honor in Lebanon.[4] Also that year Nasser[7] was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal for "his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology."[3] The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Nasser the Ellis Island Medal of Honor,[3] which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants.[5]
Nasser funds several scholarship programs[6] that assist individual students, including the Jacques Nasser Scholarship in Entrepreneurship at RMIT University in Melbourne, the Jacques Nasser Scholarship for MBA students at the American University of Beirut, and the Jacques Nasser Scholarship at the INSEAD School of Business.[3][third-party source needed] He also has been known to support organizations such as Focus: HOPE, a training center in Detroit.[3][third-party source needed]
Personal life[edit]
Nasser and his ex-wife Jennifer,[13] also an Australian,[7] married in 1970[13] and have four children together.[3][14] By 2009[38] Nasser was based primarily out of his home in Michigan,[1] though after becoming chairman of BHP Billiton[38] in 2010 he began spending equal time in Australia,[9] also having properties in New York City, London, and Melbourne. Described as a fan of racing,[13] Nasser has served as a periodic judge at Concours d'Elegance events.[45]
He has Australian-American dual citizenship, and is nicknamed "Jac".[11] He owns a 1961 Lincoln Continental. He has a sister named Betty.[46]

Early life and education[edit]
Jacques "Jac" A. Nasser was born in the city of Amyoun,[7] Lebanon[8] on 27 December 1947.[7] He is the son of a bus driver[9] and independent businessman, Abdo Nasser,[7] who served with the Australian armed forces in Lebanon during the second world war.[citation needed][10] At four years of age Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia.[3] He attended Northcote High School. He started a number of businesses as a teenager, including a bicycle-making operation[7] and several discotheques,[7] which he promoted in Melbourne[1] with his brother Jamie.[9] Nasser's first professional experience was at Ford of Australia as a student intern.[7] He graduated with a business degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1968,[11][7] where he would later be awarded with an honorary doctorate of technology.[12] He speaks four languages:[13] English, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese.[12]
Business career[edit]

Upon graduating,[7] in 1968 the 20-year-old Nasser joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst,[3] working at the head office in Australia.[14] In 1973 he joined Ford's global financial staff and transferred to Ford's North American Truck Operations in the United States.[3] Afterwards, he returned to Australia to work as a manager of product programming and financial analysis, before joining Ford's International Automotive Operations.[3] While with the international division, he helped oversee Asia-Pacific and Latin American operations.[7] While working in Argentina, Nasser was notably kidnapped by political extremists, being returned to the Ford plant two days later.[11]
Nasser helped in the negotiations of Ford's South African joint venture program in 1982.[12] The following year, he developed a business and operating plan for Ford's Hermosillo Assembly Plant in Mexico.[12] In 1987 Nasser became the first director and vice president of Autolatina,[12] a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina.[3][7]
While remaining in charge of Autolatina,[3] in 1989 he also took charge of Ford Australia, where he had started his career.[14] He remained president and CEO of Ford Australia until 1993,[7] where he picked up the corporate nicknames "Jac the Knife" for costcutting[14] efforts with Ford's supplier base.[15] He was also dubbed "Black Jack" for his ability to keep numbers north of red.[13] On 1 January 1993, Nasser was elected chairman of the board of Ford Europe,[12] a role he maintained until 1996.[7] He was promoted to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993 as well,[12][3] becoming Ford's group vice president of product development in 1994.[3] While in his position of Ford's VP, Fortune writes that he developed a reputation for working 18 hour days and regularly interacting with Ford employees via a newsletter. Wrote Fortune about his time as VP, "if Ford is a religion, then Nasser is the head preacher."[13]
VP and CEO appointments (1996–1999)[edit]
On 1 November 1996,[12] he began heading Ford Automotive Operations.[15] Nasser was the featured speaker at the 1998 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS).[12] Bloomberg Businessweek described Nasser in late 1998 as a "scrappy, hard-nosed cost-cutter who is widely credited with Ford's turnaround." The magazine further opined that since becoming Ford's automotive president in October 1996, "the blunt-talking Australian has transformed Ford from struggling with the worst profit margins in the business to scoring record earnings last year - surpassing General Motors. Nasser has slashed over $4 billion in costs in the past 18 months... and this fall he will show a further 10% of Ford's 53,000 salaried staff the door. Nasser also has a flair for car design and has reinvigorated Ford's overseas operations."[16]
Fortune in June 1998 described Nasser as "heir apparent" to Ford CEO Alex Trotman, who was soon to retire.[13] The projected high-profile appointment met with a great deal of attention in the press, and largely positive reactions.[13] Before the role was finalized, Robert A. Lutz of Chrysler categorized Nasser as a "brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker" and opined "they'd be crazy not to give him the top job."[7] The president of BMW North America stated Nasser had energy and ideas but had "to avoid diluting Ford's brands-but I suspect he understands that."[13] On 1 January 1999,[16] Nasser became president and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan.[17] At the time Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment by the simultaneously appointed chairman Bill Ford.[18] Nasser announced that he would transform Ford, according to The Economist, "from a boring old car maker" into a "consumer-products and services company".[19] He stated he would work to help Ford surpass GM in US market share, and would also try to make Ford less reliant on pickup truck sales.[13]
Initial changes at Ford (1999)[edit]
See also: Premier Automotive Group
Nasser promptly instituted a number of changes as CEO, closing plants that were losing money and selling unprofitable operations. He also instituted a new human resources policy[7] mandating that 10 percent of low-performing managers could be subject to termination, arguing that new people and turnover were good for the company.[7][20] He also instituted a program that gave internet access and home computers to employees.[7] Beyond human resources, Nasser's other focus was brand management,[19] and under Nasser's watch, in 1999 Ford formed Premier Automotive Group (PAG) to expand its market share in the luxury segment.[21][15] PAG was formed to oversee the business operations of Ford's high-end automotive marques,[22] and it grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands.[23] To reinvigorate certain brand lines, Nasser brought in car designer J Mays.[18] He also oversaw Ford's 1999 acquisition of Volvo for $6.45 billion, LandRover for $2.8 billion, and helped Ford start an "automotive e-business integrated supply chain."[24][25][26]
He diversified Ford's businesses to include e-commerce, junkyards, auto-repair shops,[18] and car distribution among others.[21][15] By August 1999, The Economist clarified that Nasser had already acquired the Kwik-Fit exhausts-and-brakes chain in Europe, American scrapyard businesses, the consumer-finance arm of Japan's Mazda, and had "even signed a deal to provide drivers with satellite-fed audio and other services for a monthly fee." The Economist pointed out the diversification was an attempt to increase profit margins, as "whereas car makers are lucky to scrape operating margins of more than 5% from actually making cars, other businesses such as leasing, renting, insurance, finance and car repair, can all achieve margins of 10-15%."[19] Also, by late 1999 Nasser was working to sell the underperforming in-house parts company, Visteon.[19] Ford of North America began marketing the Ford Focus in October 1999 for the 2000 model year as a surprise Christmas present for Nasser, with some changes from the European version.[27] Ford's profits in 1999 were USD $6.5 billion ($A9.94 billion), which Drive.com claims was the largest "ever made in the world car industry."[14]
Disputes and Firestone (2000–2001)[edit]
According to CNN, Nasser was "point man" in the dispute between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety.[15] After an investigation in early 2000 found that tread separation on Firestone tires[15] had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers,[22] Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall[22] allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others.[28] Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer as one of the safer SUVs on the market.[29] On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub-committee on the recall.[22] Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault.[22] On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, aruging Ford's tire recall was "casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires."[30] After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year,[31] with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion[14] of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles.[15] The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices.[14]
By late 2001, Nasser's efforts to diversify Ford's core business had met with mixed reactions in the press,[21][15] with analysts at The Economist and CNN arguing that diversification and recent recalls had hampered productivity.[21][15] Nasser's manager evaluation system had also proved controversial at Ford,[7] with allegations of reverse discrimination.[32] In July 2001, Nasser announced that the system was being changed[33] to "allow for more flexibility."[33] Ford settled several lawsuits over the system in late 2001 without admitting liability.[32] In October 2001,[24] the 53-year-old Nasser[14] retired from his position as Ford's CEO.[24] He was succeeded in both positions by William Clay Ford Jr,[24] who as Henry Ford's great-grandson had previously been chairman[16] and president.[14]
Recent positions (2010–present)[edit]
See also: BHP Billiton
In February 2001, Nasser became a member of the International Advisory Council of Allianz Aktiengeselischaft.[17] The following year he became a senior partner at One Equity Partners,[7] the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. Nasser was involved in 2006 when One Equity speculated on bidding for Jaguar Cars and Premier Automotive Group. [34] He also would serve as chairman of One Equity's Polaroid Corporation subsidiary[34] starting in July 2002,[7] before selling the company in 2005.[3] He remained a One Equity partner until 2014.[17] Nasser was on the board of British Sky Broadcasting from November 2002 to November 2012[17] and he served on the board of BuyTV.com.[7] In 2004, he began a four-year tenure on the board of directors at Brambles Limited, an Australian logistics company. In June 2006 he was appointed to the board the Australian mining company BHP Billiton, specifically BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc.[17]
He was elected as the next chairman of BHP Billiton in March 2010,[35] ending an 18-month search[36] to find a replacement for the retiring Don Argus.[37] The Wall Street Journal claimed that "analysts welcomed the appointment," and that Nasser had possibly been selected because BHP was "looking for the stability of another long-term chairman."[38] The Australian opined the next day that Nasser was "the right guy to lead BHP Billiton in the post-Argus era,"[9] writing about his time at Ford that "Nasser spent a good 15 years delivering Ford, with some internal reluctance, leadership of the reform agenda in the motor industry...Nasser is one reason why Ford is the one US major not to put its hand out for government money in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis."[9] He officially became chairman of BHP Billiton[17] on 13 March 2010.[17] Over the following years Nasser would help implement a number of policy changes at BHP, including a large demerger and a cap on growth projects.[2] Nasser also focused on maintaining the company's long-term financial goals, working to keep the balance sheet stable during a global downturn in the metals and oil markets, and revising the company's progressive annual dividend policy,[39] which The Australian Financial Review dubbed strategic for the "new era."[40]
On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the "most powerful people in Australian boardrooms."[1] At the time, Nasser ranked No. 18 on the Optimice Market Capitalisation Influence Index and at No. 17 on the MCII connectedness index.[1] He became a board member at 21st Century Fox in June 2013.[17] On 2 August 2015, it was confirmed that Nasser had joined the board of Koç Holding [2][17] a large Turkey-based conglomerate.[2] After the deadly Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil on 5 November 2015,[41] Nasser announced that BHP would be permitting an external investigation into the incident, with findings to be released publicly.[42]
In June 2017, BHP annonced that Nasser will be replaced by Ken MacKenzie as chairman effective on 1 September 2017.[43][44]
Honors and philanthropy[edit]
Nasser was named 'Automobile Industries Man of the Year' in 1999 by the Retail Motor Industry Organization.[7] In 2002[7] he was named an officer[4] of the National Order of the Cedar,[3] the highest honor in Lebanon.[4] Also that year Nasser[7] was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal for "his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology."[3] The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Nasser the Ellis Island Medal of Honor,[3] which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants.[5]
Nasser funds several scholarship programs[6] that assist individual students, including the Jacques Nasser Scholarship in Entrepreneurship at RMIT University in Melbourne, the Jacques Nasser Scholarship for MBA students at the American University of Beirut, and the Jacques Nasser Scholarship at the INSEAD School of Business.[3][third-party source needed] He also has been known to support organizations such as Focus: HOPE, a training center in Detroit.[3][third-party source needed]
Personal life[edit]
Nasser and his ex-wife Jennifer,[13] also an Australian,[7] married in 1970[13] and have four children together.[3][14] By 2009[38] Nasser was based primarily out of his home in Michigan,[1] though after becoming chairman of BHP Billiton[38] in 2010 he began spending equal time in Australia,[9] also having properties in New York City, London, and Melbourne. Described as a fan of racing,[13] Nasser has served as a periodic judge at Concours d'Elegance events.[45]
He has Australian-American dual citizenship, and is nicknamed "Jac".[11] He owns a 1961 Lincoln Continental. He has a sister named Betty.[46]

Early life and education[edit]
Jacques "Jac" A. Nasser was born in the city of Amyoun,[7] Lebanon[8] on 27 December 1947.[7] He is the son of a bus driver[9] and independent businessman, Abdo Nasser,[7] who served with the Australian armed forces in Lebanon during the second world war.[citation needed][10] At four years of age Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia.[3] He attended Northcote High School. He started a number of businesses as a teenager, including a bicycle-making operation[7] and several discotheques,[7] which he promoted in Melbourne[1] with his brother Jamie.[9] Nasser's first professional experience was at Ford of Australia as a student intern.[7] He graduated with a business degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1968,[11][7] where he would later be awarded with an honorary doctorate of technology.[12] He speaks four languages:[13] English, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese.[12]
Business career[edit]
Early Ford positions (1968–1997)[edit]
See also: Ford Motor Company
Upon graduating,[7] in 1968 the 20-year-old Nasser joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst,[3] working at the head office in Australia.[14] In 1973 he joined Ford's global financial staff and transferred to Ford's North American Truck Operations in the United States.[3] Afterwards, he returned to Australia to work as a manager of product programming and financial analysis, before joining Ford's International Automotive Operations.[3] While with the international division, he helped oversee Asia-Pacific and Latin American operations.[7] While working in Argentina, Nasser was notably kidnapped by political extremists, being returned to the Ford plant two days later.[11]
Nasser helped in the negotiations of Ford's South African joint venture program in 1982.[12] The following year, he developed a business and operating plan for Ford's Hermosillo Assembly Plant in Mexico.[12] In 1987 Nasser became the first director and vice president of Autolatina,[12] a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina.[3][7]
While remaining in charge of Autolatina,[3] in 1989 he also took charge of Ford Australia, where he had started his career.[14] He remained president and CEO of Ford Australia until 1993,[7] where he picked up the corporate nicknames "Jac the Knife" for costcutting[14] efforts with Ford's supplier base.[15] He was also dubbed "Black Jack" for his ability to keep numbers north of red.[13] On 1 January 1993, Nasser was elected chairman of the board of Ford Europe,[12] a role he maintained until 1996.[7] He was promoted to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993 as well,[12][3] becoming Ford's group vice president of product development in 1994.[3] While in his position of Ford's VP, Fortune writes that he developed a reputation for working 18 hour days and regularly interacting with Ford employees via a newsletter. Wrote Fortune about his time as VP, "if Ford is a religion, then Nasser is the head preacher."[13]
VP and CEO appointments (1996–1999)[edit]
On 1 November 1996,[12] he began heading Ford Automotive Operations.[15] Nasser was the featured speaker at the 1998 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS).[12] Bloomberg Businessweek described Nasser in late 1998 as a "scrappy, hard-nosed cost-cutter who is widely credited with Ford's turnaround." The magazine further opined that since becoming Ford's automotive president in October 1996, "the blunt-talking Australian has transformed Ford from struggling with the worst profit margins in the business to scoring record earnings last year - surpassing General Motors. Nasser has slashed over $4 billion in costs in the past 18 months... and this fall he will show a further 10% of Ford's 53,000 salaried staff the door. Nasser also has a flair for car design and has reinvigorated Ford's overseas operations."[16]
Fortune in June 1998 described Nasser as "heir apparent" to Ford CEO Alex Trotman, who was soon to retire.[13] The projected high-profile appointment met with a great deal of attention in the press, and largely positive reactions.[13] Before the role was finalized, Robert A. Lutz of Chrysler categorized Nasser as a "brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker" and opined "they'd be crazy not to give him the top job."[7] The president of BMW North America stated Nasser had energy and ideas but had "to avoid diluting Ford's brands-but I suspect he understands that."[13] On 1 January 1999,[16] Nasser became president and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan.[17] At the time Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment by the simultaneously appointed chairman Bill Ford.[18] Nasser announced that he would transform Ford, according to The Economist, "from a boring old car maker" into a "consumer-products and services company".[19] He stated he would work to help Ford surpass GM in US market share, and would also try to make Ford less reliant on pickup truck sales.[13]
Initial changes at Ford (1999)[edit]
See also: Premier Automotive Group
Nasser promptly instituted a number of changes as CEO, closing plants that were losing money and selling unprofitable operations. He also instituted a new human resources policy[7] mandating that 10 percent of low-performing managers could be subject to termination, arguing that new people and turnover were good for the company.[7][20] He also instituted a program that gave internet access and home computers to employees.[7] Beyond human resources, Nasser's other focus was brand management,[19] and under Nasser's watch, in 1999 Ford formed Premier Automotive Group (PAG) to expand its market share in the luxury segment.[21][15] PAG was formed to oversee the business operations of Ford's high-end automotive marques,[22] and it grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands.[23] To reinvigorate certain brand lines, Nasser brought in car designer J Mays.[18] He also oversaw Ford's 1999 acquisition of Volvo for $6.45 billion, LandRover for $2.8 billion, and helped Ford start an "automotive e-business integrated supply chain."[24][25][26]
He diversified Ford's businesses to include e-commerce, junkyards, auto-repair shops,[18] and car distribution among others.[21][15] By August 1999, The Economist clarified that Nasser had already acquired the Kwik-Fit exhausts-and-brakes chain in Europe, American scrapyard businesses, the consumer-finance arm of Japan's Mazda, and had "even signed a deal to provide drivers with satellite-fed audio and other services for a monthly fee." The Economist pointed out the diversification was an attempt to increase profit margins, as "whereas car makers are lucky to scrape operating margins of more than 5% from actually making cars, other businesses such as leasing, renting, insurance, finance and car repair, can all achieve margins of 10-15%."[19] Also, by late 1999 Nasser was working to sell the underperforming in-house parts company, Visteon.[19] Ford of North America began marketing the Ford Focus in October 1999 for the 2000 model year as a surprise Christmas present for Nasser, with some changes from the European version.[27] Ford's profits in 1999 were USD $6.5 billion ($A9.94 billion), which Drive.com claims was the largest "ever made in the world car industry."[14]
Disputes and Firestone (2000–2001)[edit]
According to CNN, Nasser was "point man" in the dispute between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety.[15] After an investigation in early 2000 found that tread separation on Firestone tires[15] had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers,[22] Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall[22] allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others.[28] Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer as one of the safer SUVs on the market.[29] On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub-committee on the recall.[22] Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault.[22] On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, aruging Ford's tire recall was "casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires."[30] After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year,[31] with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion[14] of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles.[15] The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices.[14]
By late 2001, Nasser's efforts to diversify Ford's core business had met with mixed reactions in the press,[21][15] with analysts at The Economist and CNN arguing that diversification and recent recalls had hampered productivity.[21][15] Nasser's manager evaluation system had also proved controversial at Ford,[7] with allegations of reverse discrimination.[32] In July 2001, Nasser announced that the system was being changed[33] to "allow for more flexibility."[33] Ford settled several lawsuits over the system in late 2001 without admitting liability.[32] In October 2001,[24] the 53-year-old Nasser[14] retired from his position as Ford's CEO.[24] He was succeeded in both positions by William Clay Ford Jr,[24] who as Henry Ford's great-grandson had previously been chairman[16] and president.[14]
Recent positions (2010–present)[edit]
See also: BHP Billiton
In February 2001, Nasser became a member of the International Advisory Council of Allianz Aktiengeselischaft.[17] The following year he became a senior partner at One Equity Partners,[7] the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. Nasser was involved in 2006 when One Equity speculated on bidding for Jaguar Cars and Premier Automotive Group. [34] He also would serve as chairman of One Equity's Polaroid Corporation subsidiary[34] starting in July 2002,[7] before selling the company in 2005.[3] He remained a One Equity partner until 2014.[17] Nasser was on the board of British Sky Broadcasting from November 2002 to November 2012[17] and he served on the board of BuyTV.com.[7] In 2004, he began a four-year tenure on the board of directors at Brambles Limited, an Australian logistics company. In June 2006 he was appointed to the board the Australian mining company BHP Billiton, specifically BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc.[17]
He was elected as the next chairman of BHP Billiton in March 2010,[35] ending an 18-month search[36] to find a replacement for the retiring Don Argus.[37] The Wall Street Journal claimed that "analysts welcomed the appointment," and that Nasser had possibly been selected because BHP was "looking for the stability of another long-term chairman."[38] The Australian opined the next day that Nasser was "the right guy to lead BHP Billiton in the post-Argus era,"[9] writing about his time at Ford that "Nasser spent a good 15 years delivering Ford, with some internal reluctance, leadership of the reform agenda in the motor industry...Nasser is one reason why Ford is the one US major not to put its hand out for government money in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis."[9] He officially became chairman of BHP Billiton[17] on 13 March 2010.[17] Over the following years Nasser would help implement a number of policy changes at BHP, including a large demerger and a cap on growth projects.[2] Nasser also focused on maintaining the company's long-term financial goals, working to keep the balance sheet stable during a global downturn in the metals and oil markets, and revising the company's progressive annual dividend policy,[39] which The Australian Financial Review dubbed strategic for the "new era."[40]
On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the "most powerful people in Australian boardrooms."[1] At the time, Nasser ranked No. 18 on the Optimice Market Capitalisation Influence Index and at No. 17 on the MCII connectedness index.[1] He became a board member at 21st Century Fox in June 2013.[17] On 2 August 2015, it was confirmed that Nasser had joined the board of Koç Holding [2][17] a large Turkey-based conglomerate.[2] After the deadly Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil on 5 November 2015,[41] Nasser announced that BHP would be permitting an external investigation into the incident, with findings to be released publicly.[42]
In June 2017, BHP annonced that Nasser will be replaced by Ken MacKenzie as chairman effective on 1 September 2017.[43][44]
Honors and philanthropy[edit]
Nasser was named 'Automobile Industries Man of the Year' in 1999 by the Retail Motor Industry Organization.[7] In 2002[7] he was named an officer[4] of the National Order of the Cedar,[3] the highest honor in Lebanon.[4] Also that year Nasser[7] was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal for "his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology."[3] The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Nasser the Ellis Island Medal of Honor,[3] which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants.[5]
Nasser funds several scholarship programs[6] that assist individual students, including the Jacques Nasser Scholarship in Entrepreneurship at RMIT University in Melbourne, the Jacques Nasser Scholarship for MBA students at the American University of Beirut, and the Jacques Nasser Scholarship at the INSEAD School of Business.[3][third-party source needed] He also has been known to support organizations such as Focus: HOPE, a training center in Detroit.[3][third-party source needed]
Personal life[edit]
Nasser and his ex-wife Jennifer,[13] also an Australian,[7] married in 1970[13] and have four children together.[3][14] By 2009[38] Nasser was based primarily out of his home in Michigan,[1] though after becoming chairman of BHP Billiton[38] in 2010 he began spending equal time in Australia,[9] also having properties in New York City, London, and Melbourne. Described as a fan of racing,[13] Nasser has served as a periodic judge at Concours d'Elegance events.[45]
He has Australian-American dual citizenship, and is nicknamed "Jac".[11] He owns a 1961 Lincoln Continental. He has a sister named Betty.[46]

Early life and education[edit]
Jacques "Jac" A. Nasser was born in the city of Amyoun,[7] Lebanon[8] on 27 December 1947.[7] He is the son of a bus driver[9] and independent businessman, Abdo Nasser,[7] who served with the Australian armed forces in Lebanon during the second world war.[citation needed][10] At four years of age Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia.[3] He attended Northcote High School. He started a number of businesses as a teenager, including a bicycle-making operation[7] and several discotheques,[7] which he promoted in Melbourne[1] with his brother Jamie.[9] Nasser's first professional experience was at Ford of Australia as a student intern.[7] He graduated with a business degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1968,[11][7] where he would later be awarded with an honorary doctorate of technology.[12] He speaks four languages:[13] English, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese.[12]
Business career[edit]
Early Ford positions (1968–1997)[edit]
See also: Ford Motor Company
Upon graduating,[7] in 1968 the 20-year-old Nasser joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst,[3] working at the head office in Australia.[14] In 1973 he joined Ford's global financial staff and transferred to Ford's North American Truck Operations in the United States.[3] Afterwards, he returned to Australia to work as a manager of product programming and financial analysis, before joining Ford's International Automotive Operations.[3] While with the international division, he helped oversee Asia-Pacific and Latin American operations.[7] While working in Argentina, Nasser was notably kidnapped by political extremists, being returned to the Ford plant two days later.[11]
Nasser helped in the negotiations of Ford's South African joint venture program in 1982.[12] The following year, he developed a business and operating plan for Ford's Hermosillo Assembly Plant in Mexico.[12] In 1987 Nasser became the first director and vice president of Autolatina,[12] a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina.[3][7]
While remaining in charge of Autolatina,[3] in 1989 he also took charge of Ford Australia, where he had started his career.[14] He remained president and CEO of Ford Australia until 1993,[7] where he picked up the corporate nicknames "Jac the Knife" for costcutting[14] efforts with Ford's supplier base.[15] He was also dubbed "Black Jack" for his ability to keep numbers north of red.[13] On 1 January 1993, Nasser was elected chairman of the board of Ford Europe,[12] a role he maintained until 1996.[7] He was promoted to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993 as well,[12][3] becoming Ford's group vice president of product development in 1994.[3] While in his position of Ford's VP, Fortune writes that he developed a reputation for working 18 hour days and regularly interacting with Ford employees via a newsletter. Wrote Fortune about his time as VP, "if Ford is a religion, then Nasser is the head preacher."[13]
VP and CEO appointments (1996–1999)[edit]
On 1 November 1996,[12] he began heading Ford Automotive Operations.[15] Nasser was the featured speaker at the 1998 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS).[12] Bloomberg Businessweek described Nasser in late 1998 as a "scrappy, hard-nosed cost-cutter who is widely credited with Ford's turnaround." The magazine further opined that since becoming Ford's automotive president in October 1996, "the blunt-talking Australian has transformed Ford from struggling with the worst profit margins in the business to scoring record earnings last year - surpassing General Motors. Nasser has slashed over $4 billion in costs in the past 18 months... and this fall he will show a further 10% of Ford's 53,000 salaried staff the door. Nasser also has a flair for car design and has reinvigorated Ford's overseas operations."[16]
Fortune in June 1998 described Nasser as "heir apparent" to Ford CEO Alex Trotman, who was soon to retire.[13] The projected high-profile appointment met with a great deal of attention in the press, and largely positive reactions.[13] Before the role was finalized, Robert A. Lutz of Chrysler categorized Nasser as a "brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker" and opined "they'd be crazy not to give him the top job."[7] The president of BMW North America stated Nasser had energy and ideas but had "to avoid diluting Ford's brands-but I suspect he understands that."[13] On 1 January 1999,[16] Nasser became president and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan.[17] At the time Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment by the simultaneously appointed chairman Bill Ford.[18] Nasser announced that he would transform Ford, according to The Economist, "from a boring old car maker" into a "consumer-products and services company".[19] He stated he would work to help Ford surpass GM in US market share, and would also try to make Ford less reliant on pickup truck sales.[13]

See also: Premier Automotive Group
Nasser promptly instituted a number of changes as CEO, closing plants that were losing money and selling unprofitable operations. He also instituted a new human resources policy[7] mandating that 10 percent of low-performing managers could be subject to termination, arguing that new people and turnover were good for the company.[7][20] He also instituted a program that gave internet access and home computers to employees.[7] Beyond human resources, Nasser's other focus was brand management,[19] and under Nasser's watch, in 1999 Ford formed Premier Automotive Group (PAG) to expand its market share in the luxury segment.[21][15] PAG was formed to oversee the business operations of Ford's high-end automotive marques,[22] and it grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands.[23] To reinvigorate certain brand lines, Nasser brought in car designer J Mays.[18] He also oversaw Ford's 1999 acquisition of Volvo for $6.45 billion, LandRover for $2.8 billion, and helped Ford start an "automotive e-business integrated supply chain."[24][25][26]
He diversified Ford's businesses to include e-commerce, junkyards, auto-repair shops,[18] and car distribution among others.[21][15] By August 1999, The Economist clarified that Nasser had already acquired the Kwik-Fit exhausts-and-brakes chain in Europe, American scrapyard businesses, the consumer-finance arm of Japan's Mazda, and had "even signed a deal to provide drivers with satellite-fed audio and other services for a monthly fee." The Economist pointed out the diversification was an attempt to increase profit margins, as "whereas car makers are lucky to scrape operating margins of more than 5% from actually making cars, other businesses such as leasing, renting, insurance, finance and car repair, can all achieve margins of 10-15%."[19] Also, by late 1999 Nasser was working to sell the underperforming in-house parts company, Visteon.[19] Ford of North America began marketing the Ford Focus in October 1999 for the 2000 model year as a surprise Christmas present for Nasser, with some changes from the European version.[27] Ford's profits in 1999 were USD $6.5 billion ($A9.94 billion), which Drive.com claims was the largest "ever made in the world car industry."[14]
Disputes and Firestone (2000–2001)[edit]
According to CNN, Nasser was "point man" in the dispute between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety.[15] After an investigation in early 2000 found that tread separation on Firestone tires[15] had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers,[22] Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall[22] allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others.[28] Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer as one of the safer SUVs on the market.[29] On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub-committee on the recall.[22] Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault.[22] On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, aruging Ford's tire recall was "casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires."[30] After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year,[31] with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion[14] of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles.[15] The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices.[14]
By late 2001, Nasser's efforts to diversify Ford's core business had met with mixed reactions in the press,[21][15] with analysts at The Economist and CNN arguing that diversification and recent recalls had hampered productivity.[21][15] Nasser's manager evaluation system had also proved controversial at Ford,[7] with allegations of reverse discrimination.[32] In July 2001, Nasser announced that the system was being changed[33] to "allow for more flexibility."[33] Ford settled several lawsuits over the system in late 2001 without admitting liability.[32] In October 2001,[24] the 53-year-old Nasser[14] retired from his position as Ford's CEO.[24] He was succeeded in both positions by William Clay Ford Jr,[24] who as Henry Ford's great-grandson had previously been chairman[16] and president.[14]
Recent positions (2010–present)[edit]
See also: BHP Billiton
In February 2001, Nasser became a member of the International Advisory Council of Allianz Aktiengeselischaft.[17] The following year he became a senior partner at One Equity Partners,[7] the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. Nasser was involved in 2006 when One Equity speculated on bidding for Jaguar Cars and Premier Automotive Group. [34] He also would serve as chairman of One Equity's Polaroid Corporation subsidiary[34] starting in July 2002,[7] before selling the company in 2005.[3] He remained a One Equity partner until 2014.[17] Nasser was on the board of British Sky Broadcasting from November 2002 to November 2012[17] and he served on the board of BuyTV.com.[7] In 2004, he began a four-year tenure on the board of directors at Brambles Limited, an Australian logistics company. In June 2006 he was appointed to the board the Australian mining company BHP Billiton, specifically BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc.[17]
He was elected as the next chairman of BHP Billiton in March 2010,[35] ending an 18-month search[36] to find a replacement for the retiring Don Argus.[37] The Wall Street Journal claimed that "analysts welcomed the appointment," and that Nasser had possibly been selected because BHP was "looking for the stability of another long-term chairman."[38] The Australian opined the next day that Nasser was "the right guy to lead BHP Billiton in the post-Argus era,"[9] writing about his time at Ford that "Nasser spent a good 15 years delivering Ford, with some internal reluctance, leadership of the reform agenda in the motor industry...Nasser is one reason why Ford is the one US major not to put its hand out for government money in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis."[9] He officially became chairman of BHP Billiton[17] on 13 March 2010.[17] Over the following years Nasser would help implement a number of policy changes at BHP, including a large demerger and a cap on growth projects.[2] Nasser also focused on maintaining the company's long-term financial goals, working to keep the balance sheet stable during a global downturn in the metals and oil markets, and revising the company's progressive annual dividend policy,[39] which The Australian Financial Review dubbed strategic for the "new era."[40]
On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the "most powerful people in Australian boardrooms."[1] At the time, Nasser ranked No. 18 on the Optimice Market Capitalisation Influence Index and at No. 17 on the MCII connectedness index.[1] He became a board member at 21st Century Fox in June 2013.[17] On 2 August 2015, it was confirmed that Nasser had joined the board of Koç Holding [2][17] a large Turkey-based conglomerate.[2] After the deadly Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil on 5 November 2015,[41] Nasser announced that BHP would be permitting an external investigation into the incident, with findings to be released publicly.[42]
In June 2017, BHP annonced that Nasser will be replaced by Ken MacKenzie as chairman effective on 1 September 2017.[43][44]
Honors and philanthropy[edit]
Nasser was named 'Automobile Industries Man of the Year' in 1999 by the Retail Motor Industry Organization.[7] In 2002[7] he was named an officer[4] of the National Order of the Cedar,[3] the highest honor in Lebanon.[4] Also that year Nasser[7] was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal for "his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology."[3] The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Nasser the Ellis Island Medal of Honor,[3] which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants.[5]
Nasser funds several scholarship programs[6] that assist individual students, including the Jacques Nasser Scholarship in Entrepreneurship at RMIT University in Melbourne, the Jacques Nasser Scholarship for MBA students at the American University of Beirut, and the Jacques Nasser Scholarship at the INSEAD School of Business.[3][third-party source needed] He also has been known to support organizations such as Focus: HOPE, a training center in Detroit.[3][third-party source needed]
Personal life[edit]
Nasser and his ex-wife Jennifer,[13] also an Australian,[7] married in 1970[13] and have four children together.[3][14] By 2009[38] Nasser was based primarily out of his home in Michigan,[1] though after becoming chairman of BHP Billiton[38] in 2010 he began spending equal time in Australia,[9] also having properties in New York City, London, and Melbourne. Described as a fan of racing,[13] Nasser has served as a periodic judge at Concours d'Elegance events.[45]
He has Australian-American dual citizenship, and is nicknamed "Jac".[11] He owns a 1961 Lincoln Continental. He has a sister named Betty.[46]

      						As Ford Motor Co. struggles financially, the No. 1 guessing game in Detroit is: How long can CEO Jacques Nasser keep his job? Rumors swirl daily that Nasser will be gone by year end.The pressure increased last week when the board of directors cut the stock dividend in half. But that was just one more turn of the screw. The company has lost 1.5 points of market share this year. Quality slipped below General Motors, and Ford posted a $3 billion pre-tax charge to cover the cost of the Firestone tire recall.A company spokesman declined to comment on speculation about Nasser's future.Whether or not Nasser holds on, the question has turned a spotlight on his 3-year-old administration, revealing wrong turns, misjudgments and mistakes.Nasser lost his footing on six fundamental issues:1. Ford lost its focus as an automaker.
Under Nasser, Ford did not define itself as an automaker. Instead Ford became a consumer company providing automotive goods and services.The result: Ford began struggling in its core business of engineering, manufacturing and selling cars and trucks. Product quality slipped below GM and DaimlerChrysler. Product launches were botched.The fix: Ford's turnaround specialist, Nick Scheele, arrived from Europe Aug 1. This month, he signaled a change in course. "We are going back to the basics," Scheele, the new head of the Ford brand in North America, said. "Let me repeat that. First and foremost, we are going back to the basics. The company with the best cars and trucks wins."2. Nasser fell under the spell of the Internet.
In the late 1990s, the Internet bubble rose on the economic landscape, enticing companies with the lure of profits from e-businesses trading at huge price-earnings multiples. Nasser envisioned taking public various units of a newly created Ford e-commerce group, capitalizing on the phenomenal market value of Internet stocks and vaulting Ford into the Internet age.The result: The strategy collapsed with the Internet economy. The fallout spilled over to Ford's relations with a core constituency, its retailers. Dealers today still smart from Nasser's experiments in e-retailing, viewing attempts to sell and service vehicles on the Internet as a threat to the franchised dealer network.The fix: Last week, Ford's top-ranking Internet executive, Brian Kelley, was moved to an old-economy job, president of Lincoln Mercury. Ford Division executives are meeting in Orlando, Fla,  Wednesday, Oct. 17, through Friday, Oct.19, in an attempt to repair dealer relations.3. Nasser attempted to go on his own too much.
Nasser tried to oversee personally too many aspects of running a global corporation.The result: As many as 16 executives reported directly to the Ford CEO. Bent on single-handedly wielding power at the top, Nasser failed to create a strong operating executive to back up the CEO. Nasser's micromanaging slowed decision-making and created a company in organizational limbo awaiting direction.The fix: In July, the Ford board of directors moved to circumscribe Nasser's role and cultivate a new group of decision-makers. By the end of this year, only 12 executives will report to Nasser. Lines of authority were drawn more clearly. Ford granted Scheele autonomous power to rebuild the Ford brand in North America. The company also vested more power in manufacturing boss Jim Padilla to tackle the core problem of shoddy vehicle quality.4. Nasser neglected William Clay Ford Jr.
Nasser failed to develop a sensible working relationship with Bill Ford when the Ford scion became nonexecutive chairman in January 1999.The result: The company had an uneasy balance of leadership. Nasser's hands-on style failed to accommodate Bill Ford's growing influence.The fix: In July, the Ford board created an Office of the Chairman and CEO, increasing the authority and decision-making voice of Bill Ford. Bill Ford also has more face-to-face dealings with company executives. Bill Ford and Nasser meet regularly, relying on a formal agenda.5. Nasser underestimated Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. CEO John Lampe.
Nasser compounded the Firestone tire recall by underestimating Lampe, who refused to back down when Ford fingered 13 million additional Firestone tires as potentially faulty.The result: Nasser and Lampe engaged in corporate mudslinging and finger-pointing before the press, Congress and the public. The spectacle of Firestone blaming the Ford Explorer and Ford blaming the tire maker for road deaths damaged the reputations of both companies. Meanwhile, the enormous amount of time that Nasser spent on the crisis left other important tasks undone.The fix: The debate is not over. Bridgestone/Firestone is standing behind its tough tactics, despite the company's decision to recall more tires labeled defective by the federal government. Ford has yet to be exonerated in the court of public opinion.6. Nasser spent too much time on Premier Automotive Group.
As part of a lofty vision, Nasser acquired Volvo and Land Rover, hoping to leverage the big-name brands into a global luxury powerhouse under the Premier Automotive Group umbrella.The result: Core brands such as Ford in North America stood in line for management time, talent and money. Nasser's strategy made Ford more vulnerable in North America, the company's chief source of profits.The fix: The company empowered Scheele to rebuild the Ford brand. But overhauling product quality, enriching product offerings and re-establishing rapport with dealers will take time.

      ■ Jacques Nasser spent 1999 to 2001 as president and chief
      executive officer of Ford Motor Company, the automobile maker founded by
      Henry Ford and one of the best-known companies in the world. Nasser
      planned to transform Ford by changing its focus from automotive products
      to consumer goods while emphasizing global competitiveness. He was unable
      to reverse Ford's steady loss of market share in its core business
      and could not save the company from a product safety scandal.
      Nasser's harsh human resources policies antagonized Ford workers
      and their family members and contributed to his dismissal.
    

      OUTSIDER
    

      Born in Lebanon, Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia, at
      the age of four. His olive skin marked him as an outsider in an Australia
      unfriendly to immigrants. The experience of prejudice reinforced
      Nasser's ambition to succeed while imbuing him with a resistance to
      being bound by tradition. It would also later make him sensitive to the
      problems of women and minorities. Despite the difficulties in Australia,
      Nasser began to thrive as an entrepreneur. He spent his teenage years
      starting businesses, including a bicycle-making operation and a
      discotheque. His first professional experience came as a student intern at
      Ford of Australia. After being graduated from the Royal Melbourne
      Institute of Technology with a degree in business, Nasser joined Ford as a
      financial analyst.
    

      ON THE MOVE
    

      Gregarious, energetic, and persistent, Nasser moved rapidly through the
      ranks of Ford. He held positions in Australia, Thailand, the Philippines,
      Venezuela, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Europe by displaying wizardry
      with cost cutting. This global experience and leadership strength made
      Nasser an appealing choice for a company looking to expand its reach
      around the world. To almost universal acclaim, Nasser in 1999 was named
      president and chief executive officer of Ford Motor Company. Robert A.
      Lutz, vice chairman of rival Chrysler, categorized Nasser as a
      "brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker"
      before adding, "They'd be crazy not to give him the top
      job" (Zesiger, June 22, 1998). At the time Ford had 370,000
      employees in two hundred countries, sales and revenues of $143 billion,
      record earnings of $6.6 billion, and a stock price of $65 per share.
    

      PASSION FOR CHANGE
    

      Despite its success Ford had lost a considerable amount of market share by
      the 1990s. Nasser immediately began to
       streamline the company in an effort to create a giant that responded
      quickly to consumers. Nasser closed money-losing plants, discontinued
      models that did not generate adequate profits, sold unprofitable
      operations, and weeded out executives. He also instituted a human
      resources policy mandating that 10 percent of workers receive a
      "C" grade that could lead to termination. Nasser argued that
      new people, new philosophies, and new technologies were required to assure
      Ford's success in the new economy. Ford employees unflatteringly
      gave Nasser the nickname "Jac the Knife."
    

      Contrary to later complaints that he spent little time on the core car
      business, Nasser aimed to reinvigorate Ford's passenger car market.
      But Ford made most of its profits from trucks, and Nasser struggled to
      hold market share in the face of stiff Japanese competition. During his
      reign, Nasser oversaw the growth and acquisition of Jaguar, Aston Martin,
      Volvo, Land Rover, and Hertz. He added strength to Ford's light
      truck and sport utility vehicles and oversaw successes with the
      introduction of the Ford Ka and the Ford Focus as well as the sporty,
      two-seater Thunderbird.
    

      Along with brand and product development, Nasser focused on global
      competitiveness, closer connections to the consumer, increased diversity,
      and leadership development. He envisioned Ford not only as the potential
      leader in the world car market but also as a provider of rental vehicles,
      auto repair, and satellite radio. To facilitate communication and market
      awareness, Nasser instituted a program that provided home computers and
      Internet access to employees. Workers gained the power, in a very
      hierarchical company, to make decisions both small and large. Nasser also
      launched his own affirmative action program, ensuring that 30 percent of
      new employees came from minority groups.
    

      PRODUCT RECALL AND PERSONNEL DISASTERS
    

      Nasser's greatest challenge came in 2000 when Ford's
      flag-ship four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle, the Explorer, was
      involved in numerous rollover accidents. Two hundred deaths were
      ultimately linked to the Firestone Wilderness AT tires that were standard
      issue on the vehicle. Firestone recalled 6.5 million tires, and Ford
      committed itself to replace millions more. Nasser defended the integrity
      of Ford, even appearing in television commercials to protect the long-term
      corporate reputation of the company and its employees. In the short term,
      the company reported its first consecutive quarterly losses in nearly a
      decade.
    

      While the Explorer debacle soured Ford's fortunes and contributed
      to Nasser's removal in October 2001, plummeting employee morale was
      the factor that ensured his dismissal. The Ford family controlled 40
      percent of the company stock and had a paternal attitude toward employees.
      The family had serious disagreements with Nasser over his draconian
      personnel evaluation methods and the resulting employee lawsuits. When he
      replaced Nasser as CEO, William Ford Jr. announced that his first task
      would be healing the company.
    

      Although he was fired, Nasser regarded his Ford days as a positive
      experience because of the friends he made and lessons that he learned. In
      2002 Nasser became a senior partner in One Equity Partners, the private
      equity business of Bank One Corporation. He bore responsibility for
      identifying, evaluating, and implementing direct equity investments in
      various industries around the world. An affiliate of One Equity acquired
      Polaroid, the instant-imaging camera giant, in July 2002, following the
      company's voluntary bankruptcy filing in 2001. Nasser became the
      nonexecutive chairman of Polaroid. He also served on the boards of a
      number of companies, including Allianz, British Sky Broadcasting Group,
      and BuyTV.

NEW YORK (CNNmoney) - Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday that Jacques Nasser will be replaced as chief executive officer by William Clay Ford Jr. as the nation's No. 2 automaker struggles to stem losses.



In addition, Nick Scheele, the group vice president for North America, will become the new chief operating officer of Ford Motor, while Jim Padilla, 55, group vice president for manufacturing and quality, will take over Scheele's job as head of the North America unit.



And longtime Ford board member Carl Reichardt, the retired CEO and chairman of Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC: Research, Estimates), will take the title of vice chairman of the board and take an active role overseeing financial operations, including Ford Credit.







 


Jacques NasserFord CEO is out of a job.

The moves come as Ford has been cutting management positions and other jobs in recent months during a review of company operations as it struggles to return to profitability.

Ford (F: up $0.04 to $16.09, Research, Estimates) stock was little changed in midday trading after the long-anticipated announcement.



Scheele, who was brought to North America this summer after making improvements in Ford's European operations and luxury brands, was already conducting a review of the businesses looking for cost savings. Scheele said Tuesday that review was about halfway done, although he said that the pre-Christmas deadline for a final cost-cutting plan could be pushed back to early January. He and Ford told a Tuesday news conference that all parts of the company are under scrutiny.



"We won't hesitate to pull the trigger if something isn't fitting in well," said Ford. "I think we have lost the focus in a couple of areas."

Ford, 44, is the great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford and nephew of the late former chairman and CEO Henry Ford II. He also is great-grandson of Harvey Firestone, founder of the tire company that has clashed with Ford Motor Co. in the last year over which company is to blame for fatal rollover accidents involving the popular Ford Explorer sport/utility vehicles and Firestone tires.



A Princeton graduate with a master of science degree in management from MIT, the scion joined the company in 1979 as a product planning analyst and was elected chairman of the board in September 1998.



He admits he has a different kind of reputation than the typical CEO, as he said his strong pro-environmental views have given him a "tree-hugger" label. He insisted Tuesday his views on the environment are not at odds with company's core objectives and will be integrated into Ford products through use of improved technology.



He also has a relatively pro-employee, even pro-union, reputation, and he said improving relationships with the United Autoworkers union as well as other employees and constituency groups would be a key to his job going forward.



"You can't rebuild the business if you don't have strong partnerships," Ford said. "Dealers, UAW, white collar employees, suppliers, Wall Street - we have a lot of relationships that are important to us. A lot of those are broken or not healthy."



Ford becomes the third descendent of founder Henry Ford to hold the top executive job, but the first since his uncle Henry Ford II stepped down as CEO in 1979. Ford also said that while his name and his family's control of the company's voting stock was a factor in his selection, he didn't think it was the deciding factor.




 





William Clay Ford, great-grandson of Ford Motor Co. founder Henry Ford, is the new CEO of the world's No. 2 automaker.

"I would hope the board of directors takes their job more seriously than putting in the guy with the right last name," he said at the press conference. He insisted that despite reports of problems between him and Nasser, the two have a good relationship and had a cordial conversation Monday when discussing the change. While there has been speculation about Ford assuming the CEO for some time, he said it was "fairly recently" that he and others on the board decided it was time to make the change.



"Until very recently (Nasser) and I felt the model we had in place was going to work," he said. The recent problems at the company had raised the level of speculation about a change to such a level that a change became necessary, he said.



"To say we were distracted was an understatement," he said. "It was reaching a paralysis point for a lot of our management."



Ford also is a black belt in the martial art of tae kwon do and the vice chairman of the Detroit Lions football team, which his family also controls.



"You'd think the Lions won a game or something," he joked when he was greeted by applause before his remarks to employees.



Nasser, 53, joined Ford of Australia in 1968 as a financial analyst. Known as Jack, his cost-cutting efforts earned him the nickname "Jack the knife."



Some analysts said that Nasser's departure was a good thing for the company.



"Nasser's been the primary architect of a failed transformation of Ford from its core automotive heritage to some expansive consumer-centric organization, which we think employees, dealers, suppliers and investors have found to varying degrees to be somewhat incomprehensible," said Scott Hill, auto analyst with Sanford Bernstein, told CNNfn's Market Call Tuesday.



Nasser was the company's point man in the dispute with tiremaker Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over which company was responsible for the safety problems and hundreds of deaths linked to Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires. Ford Motor eventually decided to replace Firestone Wilderness AT tires on its vehicles at its own expense.



In addition to the replacement of Firestone tires, which cost Ford about $2.1 billion after taxes, the company has been hit in recent months with declining market share and narrowing of its competitive advantage over other U.S.-based automakers in measures of productivity amid a series of recalls and problems with the launches of new vehicles.

On Monday, the company announced it was following General Motors Corp. (GM: Research, Estimates) and DaimlerChryler AG (DCX: Research, Estimates) in extending popular but expensive zero-interest financing for many of its new cars. The company has pointed to the cost of those incentives as part of the reason for its losses in the third quarter, and warned it would have trouble making money in the fourth quarter as well. Ford executives confirmed that warning Tuesday without giving more specific financial guidance.



In his comments to employees Ford emphasized the continuation of much of Ford's other top management in his announcement.



"We have a strong, experienced management team in place," he said. "Ford Motor Company is not, and never has been, about one person."

The shake-up at Ford
Jacques knifed
Jacques Nasser may be gone, replaced at the wheel by a scion of the founding family. But the car maker's problems are far from over

SINCE the days of the first Henry Ford, outside managers have always had a precarious grip on power at the Ford Motor Company, in which the Ford family holds 40% of the voting shares. When Henry Ford II, known to friends as Hank the Deuce, fired his high-profile president, Lee Iacocca, a quarter of a century ago, he offered a mere five words in explanation: “I just don't like you.” On October 30th, the knife was out again at the world's second-biggest car maker, this time plunging into the back of Jacques Nasser, the company's chief executive.
Mr Nasser's place at Ford's helm is being taken by William Clay Ford Jr, great-grandson of the founder and part-time chairman for the past three years. The relationship between Mr Nasser and Mr Ford was never easy. One row a couple of years ago grew so heated that a frightened secretary, sitting outside Mr Nasser's office, summoned security. The rapport did not improve when, several months ago, Mr Ford became more closely involved in the running of the company after a power-sharing “office of the chairman and chief executive” was formed. 
This week, Mr Ford admitted that he had been plotting the removal of Mr Nasser for about a month. The company, he said, had become paralysed by the “cacophony” of speculation inside and out that the pair were not getting on, amid worsening performance as Ford racked up losses of $1.4 billion in the past six months, after a long run of profits. The stockmarket welcomed the changes, not because investors have developed a liking for nepotism, but because the company at last appears to be facing up to its problems—and because Mr Ford will be surrounded by some able lieutenants. These include Carl Reichardt, a former boss of the Wells Fargo bank and already a non-executive director at Ford, who becomes vice-chairman and finance supremo; and Sir Nick Scheele, head of Ford's North American operations, who becomes chief operating officer in the reshuffle. In effect, Sir Nick will run the company alongside Mr Ford.

Although Mr Nasser had built a reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter, his tenure as chief executive was marked by mistakes and mishaps. Modelling himself on General Electric's Jack Welch, he set out to transform a hidebound car company. Unlike Mr Welch, however, he failed to combine charisma with the charm that can make employees like even the toughest of leaders. He dared to try to overtake General Motors (GM) as the world's biggest car maker, largely by developing car-related service businesses. Instead, Ford's sales slipped as its products lost allure in both America and Europe. 
Mr Nasser's bold foray into e-commerce led to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses
Under Mr Nasser, the quality of Ford's vehicles, long the best in Detroit, deteriorated. So did productivity and profits. Ford cars now cost about $1,000 more to make than they did five years ago, but prices have meanwhile fallen in real terms. Mr Nasser's bold foray into e-commerce led to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. His move into car distribution, buying some big dealers, merely alienated the others. Inside the company, his performance-review system, which threatened laggard managers with dismissal, backfired and undermined morale. Like the dealer purchases, this policy had to be reversed.
All might have been forgiven or tolerated a little longer, were it not for the Firestone fiasco. In August 2000, and again in May 2001, Ford was forced to recall millions of Firestone tyres. It blamed the tyre manufacturer for a series of accidents that have now claimed more than 300 lives. Firestone insisted that the problem lay with design defects in Ford's Explorer sport-utility vehicle (SUV). Hauled before Congress and pilloried in the press, Ford faced a year of excoriation. The campaign greatly damaged the firm's reputation as being customer-friendly.

Heir transplant
Is Mr Ford the right person to get the company back on the road? The first family member at the wheel since 1979, he insisted this week, unconvincingly, that his newly expanded role was not just the result of “having the right last name”. The highest position he held before using family clout to get on the board was running the air-conditioning division. But those who question his credentials do so at their peril. The tenure of a former Ford chairman, Donald Peterson, came to an abrupt end in 1989 when he dared question the young Mr Ford's desire to take a board seat.
Going from chairman (“I manage the board, Jacques manages the company,” he used to say) to chief executive will test the mettle of the affable heir. He has benefited from a carefully crafted image as a family man and avowed environmentalist. Unlike Mr Nasser, he is popular in Ford: he got a standing ovation from staff after his appointment this week. He was highly visible at the scene of a power plant explosion that killed several Ford employees two years ago, but stayed clear of the Firestone flap, leaving Mr Nasser to take the heat. However, his criticism of the company's most profitable product, its gas-guzzling SUVs, vexed investors. In his new role, Mr Ford promises to use technology to benefit both shareholders and the environment.
Virtually everything Mr Nasser put in place is under scrutiny
His first challenge is to stop Ford's losses, which, in his words, requires the company to go “back to basics”. He was anything but kind this week about Mr Nasser's legacy: the abrasive Australian had, he said, “dropped the ball” and “lost focus”. Virtually everything Mr Nasser put in place is under scrutiny in a review that has been under way for some months, led by Sir Nick, who made his reputation turning round Jaguar after Ford bought it in 1989. (Jaguar also lost its boss this week: Jonathan Browning, who helped steer the division to record sales, resigned, apparently unhappy that it was being lumped with other British subsidiaries under an “operating committee”.)
Until three months ago, Sir Nick was overseeing the turnaround at Ford Europe, before being called to Detroit to run the North American operations and carry out a review of what was going wrong in the company. He also took over much of Mr Nasser's work. Sir Nick says he has been looking at much more than just capacity cuts. He points out that Ford became complacent in the light-truck market (minivans, SUVs and so on), where its dominance came to be challenged by superior new products from competitors such as Toyota. This hit Ford hard, because light trucks are where it makes most of its profits in North America. So developing new products in this area is a priority. Another big challenge will be rebuilding the company's relationships with customers, dealers, suppliers and employees.
“He was the right man in the right place at the wrong time”
Is Mr Nasser really to blame for all that has gone wrong? “He was the right man in the right place at the wrong time,” argues an admirer. But the reality now facing Ford is anything but the rosy picture of industry domination that Mr Nasser painted. The company will struggle to rebuild its market share and profits in the face of a withering assault from Japanese, European and South Korean car makers. Sir Nick says he will not disclose targets for market share—a sure sign that times are tough.
Worse still for Ford, GM is on its way to posting its first annual market-share gain in 30 years. Forced to match the market leader's interest-free customer finance scheme, Ford's losses are mounting. To make matters worse, its debt was recently downgraded by the main credit-rating agencies. The extra borrowing costs put Ford in a “very difficult period”, according to Mr Reichardt. With signs that the American economy—and car sales—will shrink in 2002, Mr Ford and his new team will struggle to find early remedies. When a car company slows down as much as Ford has, it takes a long time and lots of punchy new products to regain momentum.

Early life
Nasser was born in Amyoun, Lebanon, moving to Melbourne, Australia, with his family at the age of four. He graduated in business from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Melbourne. Nasser is the son of businessman, Abdo Nasser.

Career at Ford
40x40pxThis section is written like a personal reflection or opinion essay that states the Wikipedia editor's particular feelings about a topic, rather than the opinions of experts. Please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style. (April 2014)
Nasser joined Ford Motor Company in 1968 as a financial analyst in its Australian unit. He then joined Ford's International Automotive Operations in various management roles. 
In 1987 he became vice president of Finance and Administration for Autolatina, a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina. He was promoted to the chairman of the board of Ford Europe, to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993, group vice president of product development in 1994. In 1996, he headed Ford Automotive Operations. Nicknamed "Jacques the Knife", Nasser was known for his sharp cost-cutting efforts with Ford's component supplier base.[1]
On 1 January 1999, he became President and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan, USA. 
Nasser became CEO when Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment.[2]  Nasser proclaimed that he would transform Ford "from a boring old car maker whose shares achieve a price-earnings ratio of only ten, into a consumer-products and services company commanding a multiple of more like thirty".[1]  Nasser tried to model himself after General Electric's Jack Welch in remaking Ford but he lacked charisma.[3]
Under Nasser's watch, Ford acquired Volvo Cars and Land Rover and placed them under the newly Premier Automotive Group in order to expand its market share in the luxury segment. Nasser also aimed to overtake General Motors by developing car-related services, but hundreds of millions of dollars were wasted on e-commerce, car distribution, junkyards, and auto-repair shops. Meanwhile the productivity of plants and quality of Ford vehicles slipped. According to an analyst, "Nasser's been the primary architect of a failed transformation of Ford from its core automotive heritage to some expansive consumer-centric organization, which we think employees, dealers, suppliers and investors have found to varying degrees to be somewhat incomprehensible".[4][5]
His later tenure as CEO was tainted by the Firestone and Ford tire controversy. In September 2000, after initially trying to avoid appearing, Nasser fronted a US Congressional sub-committee over the recall of Firestone tires fitted to Ford's sports utility vehicles. The tires were estimated to have caused between 130 and 200 deaths through disintegration, and Ford is suspected to have known about problems well before the recall was issued.[2] Firestone blamed the problems on the Ford Explorer SUV, though Ford denied the accusation[3] The scandal was estimated to have cost Ford around A$4.4 billion with share prices and quarterly results also falling sharply shortly before Nasser left the company.[4]
Jacques Nasser was also the architect of the very controversial "Performance Management Process" evaluation system which ranked employee performance.  The evaluation system mandated that 5% of senior managers be given the lowest of three grades each year. Those who didn't improve after 2 years could be demoted or fired.  The controversy began when Nasser informed shareholders on May 13, 1999, that they could “expect to see accelerated change” in the “diversity of our employees.” That change was implemented very quickly.  Nasser stated in a videotaped address to top executives that he did not like the "sea of white faces in the audience, and that (the) Ford Motor Company must ensure that in the future, the company reflects the broad spectrum of Ford’s customers.  Numerous class-action lawsuits were filed against Ford accusing them of using the system to weed out employees on biases of skin color, age and gender – not because of job performance.  One of the suits accused Ford of systematically forcing out white males to satisfy minority quotas.  Nasser vigorously defended the ranking system stating that it "inspired the best performance of everyone on the management team."  The flawed evaluation system cost the Ford Motor Company tens of millions of dollars when the lawsuits were finally settled. Together, the suits represented one of the largest and potentially costliest white-collar civil actions against a major company in U.S. history and it cost Jacques Nasser his job.  Nasser submitted his resignation in October 2001, however some sources report he was dumped by Ford. Despite this Nasser received a US$17 million golden handshake when he left.[5] He was succeeded by William Clay Ford Jr.

Later career
Following his career with Ford Motor Company, Nasser worked with One Equity Partners the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase as a Partner from 2002 to 2010, a Non-Executive Advisory Partner from 2010 to 2013 and as a Consultant since 2013. There, he led a number of deals, including the sale of Polaroid Corporation.
In addition, Nasser has served as a Non-Executive Director on the boards of British Sky Broadcasting (2002 to 2012), Brambles Limited (2004 to 2008), BHP Billiton (2006 to present) and 21st Century Fox (2013 to present). In 2010 he was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman of BHP Billiton. Nasser also serves on the International Advisory Council of Allianz.[6]

Honors and philanthropy
In recognition of his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology, Nasser was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal. Nasser was also awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, and the National Order of the Cedar from Lebanon. Mr. Nasser funds several individual scholarship programs.

Nasser AC (Arabic: جاك نصر; born 12 December 1947) is an Australian business executive and philanthropist. Known for a management career at Ford Motor Company spanning several decades and continents, from 1999 to 2001 he served as Ford's CEO and president. He subsequently was a partner at One Equity Partners (JPMorgan) and on the board of British Sky Broadcasting. In 2010 he was appointed chairman of the Australian mining company BHP Billiton. On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the "most powerful people in Australian boardrooms."[1] Beyond BHP Billiton, he currently serves on the boards of 21st Century Fox and Koç Holding.[2] A member of both the National Order of the Cedar[3] in Lebanon[4] and the Order of Australia,[3] Nasser was also awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor,[3] which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants.[5] Nasser funds several scholarship programs[6] that assist individual students.[3]Contents1 Early life and education2 Business career2.1 Early Ford positions (1968–1997)2.2 VP and CEO appointments (1996–1999)2.3 Initial changes at Ford (1999)2.4 Disputes and Firestone (2000–2001)2.5 Recent positions (2010–present)3 Honors and philanthropy4 Personal life5 See also6 References7 External linksEarly life and educationJacques "Jac" A. Nasser was born in the city of Amyoun,[7] Lebanon[8] on 27 December 1947.[7] He is the son of a bus driver[9] and independent businessman, Abdo Nasser,[7] who served with the Australian armed forces in Lebanon during the second world war.[citation needed][10] At four years of age Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia.[3] He attended Northcote High School. He started a number of businesses as a teenager, including a bicycle-making operation[7] and several discotheques,[7] which he promoted in Melbourne[1] with his brother Jamie.[9] Nasser's first professional experience was at Ford of Australia as a student intern.[7] He graduated with a business degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1968,[11][7] where he would later be awarded with an honorary doctorate of technology.[12] He speaks four languages:[13] English, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese.[12]Business careerEarly Ford positions (1968–1997)See also: Ford Motor CompanyUpon graduating,[7] in 1968 the 20-year-old Nasser joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst,[3] working at the head office in Australia.[14] In 1973 he joined Ford's global financial staff and transferred to Ford's North American Truck Operations in the United States.[3] Afterwards, he returned to Australia to work as a manager of product programming and financial analysis, before joining Ford's International Automotive Operations.[3] While with the international division, he helped oversee Asia-Pacific and Latin American operations.[7] While working in Argentina, Nasser was notably kidnapped by political extremists, being returned to the Ford plant two days later.[11]Nasser helped in the negotiations of Ford's South African joint venture program in 1982.[12] The following year, he developed a business and operating plan for Ford's Hermosillo Assembly Plant in Mexico.[12] In 1987 Nasser became the first director and vice president of Autolatina,[12] a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina.[3][7]While remaining in charge of Autolatina,[3] in 1989 he also took charge of Ford Australia, where he had started his career.[14] He remained president and CEO of Ford Australia until 1993,[7] where he picked up the corporate nicknames "Jac the Knife" for costcutting[14] efforts with Ford's supplier base.[15] He was also dubbed "Black Jack" for his ability to keep numbers north of red.[13] On 1 January 1993, Nasser was elected chairman of the board of Ford Europe,[12] a role he maintained until 1996.[7] He was promoted to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993 as well,[12][3] becoming Ford's group vice president of product development in 1994.[3] While in his position of Ford's VP, Fortune writes that he developed a reputation for working 18 hour days and regularly interacting with Ford employees via a newsletter. Wrote Fortune about his time as VP, "if Ford is a religion, then Nasser is the head preacher."[13]VP and CEO appointments (1996–1999)On 1 November 1996,[12] he began heading Ford Automotive Operations.[15] Nasser was the featured speaker at the 1998 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS).[12] Bloomberg Businessweek described Nasser in late 1998 as a "scrappy, hard-nosed cost-cutter who is widely credited with Ford's turnaround." The magazine further opined that since becoming Ford's automotive president in October 1996, "the blunt-talking Australian has transformed Ford from struggling with the worst profit margins in the business to scoring record earnings last year - surpassing General Motors. Nasser has slashed over $4 billion in costs in the past 18 months... and this fall he will show a further 10% of Ford's 53,000 salaried staff the door. Nasser also has a flair for car design and has reinvigorated Ford's overseas operations."[16]Fortune in June 1998 described Nasser as "heir apparent" to Ford CEO Alex Trotman, who was soon to retire.[13] The projected high-profile appointment met with a great deal of attention in the press, and largely positive reactions.[13] Before the role was finalized, Robert A. Lutz of Chrysler categorized Nasser as a "brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker" and opined "they'd be crazy not to give him the top job."[7] The president of BMW North America stated Nasser had energy and ideas but had "to avoid diluting Ford's brands-but I suspect he understands that."[13] On 1 January 1999,[16] Nasser became president and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan.[17] At the time Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment by the simultaneously appointed chairman Bill Ford.[18] Nasser announced that he would transform Ford, according to The Economist, "from a boring old car maker" into a "consumer-products and services company".[19] He stated he would work to help Ford surpass GM in US market share, and would also try to make Ford less reliant on pickup truck sales.[13]Initial changes at Ford (1999)See also: Premier Automotive GroupNasser promptly instituted a number of changes as CEO, closing plants that were losing money and selling unprofitable operations. He also instituted a new human resources policy[7] mandating that 10 percent of low-performing managers could be subject to termination, arguing that new people and turnover were good for the company.[7][20] He also instituted a program that gave internet access and home computers to employees.[7] Beyond human resources, Nasser's other focus was brand management,[19] and under Nasser's watch, in 1999 Ford formed Premier Automotive Group (PAG) to expand its market share in the luxury segment.[21][15] PAG was formed to oversee the business operations of Ford's high-end automotive marques,[22] and it grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands.[23] To reinvigorate certain brand lines, Nasser brought in car designer J Mays.[18] He also oversaw Ford's 1999 acquisition of Volvo for $6.45 billion, LandRover for $2.8 billion, and helped Ford start an "automotive e-business integrated supply chain."[24][25][26]He diversified Ford's businesses to include e-commerce, junkyards, auto-repair shops,[18] and car distribution among others.[21][15] By August 1999, The Economist clarified that Nasser had already acquired the Kwik-Fit exhausts-and-brakes chain in Europe, American scrapyard businesses, the consumer-finance arm of Japan's Mazda, and had "even signed a deal to provide drivers with satellite-fed audio and other services for a monthly fee." The Economist pointed out the diversification was an attempt to increase profit margins, as "whereas car makers are lucky to scrape operating margins of more than 5% from actually making cars, other businesses such as leasing, renting, insurance, finance and car repair, can all achieve margins of 10-15%."[19] Also, by late 1999 Nasser was working to sell the underperforming in-house parts company, Visteon.[19] Ford of North America began marketing the Ford Focus in October 1999 for the 2000 model year as a surprise Christmas present for Nasser, with some changes from the European version.[27] Ford's profits in 1999 were USD $6.5 billion ($A9.94 billion), which Drive.com claims was the largest "ever made in the world car industry."[14]Disputes and Firestone (2000–2001)According to CNN, Nasser was "point man" in the dispute between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety.[15] After an investigation in early 2000 found that tread separation on Firestone tires[15] had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers,[22] Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall[22] allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others.[28] Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer as one of the safer SUVs on the market.[29] On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub-committee on the recall.[22] Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault.[22] On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, aruging Ford's tire recall was "casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires."[30] After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year,[31] with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion[14] of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles.[15] The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices.[14]By late 2001, Nasser's efforts to diversify Ford's core business had met with mixed reactions in the press,[21][15] with analysts at The Economist and CNN arguing that diversification and recent recalls had hampered productivity.[21][15] Nasser's manager evaluation system had also proved controversial at Ford,[7] with allegations of reverse discrimination.[32] In July 2001, Nasser announced that the system was being changed[33] to "allow for more flexibility."[33] Ford settled several lawsuits over the system in late 2001 without admitting liability.[32] In October 2001,[24] the 53-year-old Nasser[14] retired from his position as Ford's CEO.[24] He was succeeded in both positions by William Clay Ford Jr,[24] who as Henry Ford's great-grandson had previously been chairman[16] and president.[14]Recent positions (2010–present)See also: BHP BillitonIn February 2001, Nasser became a member of the International Advisory Council of Allianz Aktiengeselischaft.[17] The following year he became a senior partner at One Equity Partners,[7] the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. Nasser was involved in 2006 when One Equity speculated on bidding for Jaguar Cars and Premier Automotive Group. [34] He also would serve as chairman of One Equity's Polaroid Corporation subsidiary[34] starting in July 2002,[7] before selling the company in 2005.[3] He remained a One Equity partner until 2014.[17] Nasser was on the board of British Sky Broadcasting from November 2002 to November 2012[17] and he served on the board of BuyTV.com.[7] In 2004, he began a four-year tenure on the board of directors at Brambles Limited, an Australian logistics company. In June 2006 he was appointed to the board the Australian mining company BHP Billiton, specifically BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc.[17]He was elected as the next chairman of BHP Billiton in March 2010,[35] ending an 18-month search[36] to find a replacement for the retiring Don Argus.[37] The Wall Street Journal claimed that "analysts welcomed the appointment," and that Nasser had possibly been selected because BHP was "looking for the stability of another long-term chairman."[38] The Australian opined the next day that Nasser was "the right guy to lead BHP Billiton in the post-Argus era,"[9] writing about his time at Ford that "Nasser spent a good 15 years delivering Ford, with some internal reluctance, leadership of the reform agenda in the motor industry...Nasser is one reason why Ford is the one US major not to put its hand out for government money in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis."[9] He officially became chairman of BHP Billiton[17] on 13 March 2010.[17] Over the following years Nasser would help implement a number of policy changes at BHP, including a large demerger and a cap on growth projects.[2] Nasser also focused on maintaining the company's long-term financial goals, working to keep the balance sheet stable during a global downturn in the metals and oil markets, and revising the company's progressive annual dividend policy,[39] which The Australian Financial Review dubbed strategic for the "new era."[40]On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the "most powerful people in Australian boardrooms."[1] At the time, Nasser ranked No. 18 on the Optimice Market Capitalisation Influence Index and at No. 17 on the MCII connectedness index.[1] He became a board member at 21st Century Fox in June 2013.[17] On 2 August 2015, it was confirmed that Nasser had joined the board of Koç Holding [2][17] a large Turkey-based conglomerate.[2] After the deadly Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil on 5 November 2015,[41] Nasser announced that BHP would be permitting an external investigation into the incident, with findings to be released publicly.[42]In June 2017, BHP annonced that Nasser will be replaced by Ken MacKenzie as chairman effective on 1 September 2017.[43][44]Honors and philanthropyNasser was named 'Automobile Industries Man of the Year' in 1999 by the Retail Motor Industry Organization.[7] In 2002[7] he was named an officer[4] of the National Order of the Cedar,[3] the highest honor in Lebanon.[4] Also that year Nasser[7] was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal for "his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology."[3] The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Nasser the Ellis Island Medal of Honor,[3] which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants.[5]Nasser funds several scholarship programs[6] that assist individual students, including the Jacques Nasser Scholarship in Entrepreneurship at RMIT University in Melbourne, the Jacques Nasser Scholarship for MBA students at the American University of Beirut, and the Jacques Nasser Scholarship at the INSEAD School of Business.[3][third-party source needed] He also has been known to support organizations such as Focus: HOPE, a training center in Detroit.[3][third-party source needed]Personal lifeNasser and his ex-wife Jennifer,[13] also an Australian,[7] married in 1970[13] and have four children together.[3][14] By 2009[38] Nasser was based primarily out of his home in Michigan,[1] though after becoming chairman of BHP Billiton[38] in 2010 he began spending equal time in Australia,[9] also having properties in New York City, London, and Melbourne. Described as a fan of racing,[13] Nasser has served as a periodic judge at Concours d'Elegance events.[45]He has Australian-American dual citizenship, and is nicknamed "Jac".[11] He owns a 1961 Lincoln Continental. He has a sister named Betty.[46]See alsoAustralia portalCars portalBusiness portalList of CEOs of Ford Motor CompanyList of alumni and faculty of the Royal Melbourne Institute of TechnologyList of Lebanese Australians / Australian Americans / Lebanese AmericansList of Lebanese people / in Australia / by net worthReferences^ a b c d e Densley, Jaclyn (5 December 2012).

Early life and education[edit]
Jacques "Jac" A. Nasser was born in the city of Amyoun,[7] Lebanon[8] on 27 December 1947.[7] He is the son of a bus driver[9] and independent businessman, Abdo Nasser,[7] who served with the Australian armed forces in Lebanon during the second world war.[citation needed][10] At four years of age Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia.[3] He attended Northcote High School. He started a number of businesses as a teenager, including a bicycle-making operation[7] and several discotheques,[7] which he promoted in Melbourne[1] with his brother Jamie.[9] Nasser's first professional experience was at Ford of Australia as a student intern.[7] He graduated with a business degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1968,[11][7] where he would later be awarded with an honorary doctorate of technology.[12] He speaks four languages:[13] English, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese.[12]
Business career[edit]
Early Ford positions (1968–1997)[edit]
See also: Ford Motor Company
Upon graduating,[7] in 1968 the 20-year-old Nasser joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst,[3] working at the head office in Australia.[14] In 1973 he joined Ford's global financial staff and transferred to Ford's North American Truck Operations in the United States.[3] Afterwards, he returned to Australia to work as a manager of product programming and financial analysis, before joining Ford's International Automotive Operations.[3] While with the international division, he helped oversee Asia-Pacific and Latin American operations.[7] While working in Argentina, Nasser was notably kidnapped by political extremists, being returned to the Ford plant two days later.[11]
Nasser helped in the negotiations of Ford's South African joint venture program in 1982.[12] The following year, he developed a business and operating plan for Ford's Hermosillo Assembly Plant in Mexico.[12] In 1987 Nasser became the first director and vice president of Autolatina,[12] a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina.[3][7]
While remaining in charge of Autolatina,[3] in 1989 he also took charge of Ford Australia, where he had started his career.[14] He remained president and CEO of Ford Australia until 1993,[7] where he picked up the corporate nicknames "Jac the Knife" for costcutting[14] efforts with Ford's supplier base.[15] He was also dubbed "Black Jack" for his ability to keep numbers north of red.[13] On 1 January 1993, Nasser was elected chairman of the board of Ford Europe,[12] a role he maintained until 1996.[7] He was promoted to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993 as well,[12][3] becoming Ford's group vice president of product development in 1994.[3] While in his position of Ford's VP, Fortune writes that he developed a reputation for working 18 hour days and regularly interacting with Ford employees via a newsletter. Wrote Fortune about his time as VP, "if Ford is a religion, then Nasser is the head preacher."[13]
VP and CEO appointments (1996–1999)[edit]
On 1 November 1996,[12] he began heading Ford Automotive Operations.[15] Nasser was the featured speaker at the 1998 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS).[12] Bloomberg Businessweek described Nasser in late 1998 as a "scrappy, hard-nosed cost-cutter who is widely credited with Ford's turnaround." The magazine further opined that since becoming Ford's automotive president in October 1996, "the blunt-talking Australian has transformed Ford from struggling with the worst profit margins in the business to scoring record earnings last year - surpassing General Motors. Nasser has slashed over $4 billion in costs in the past 18 months... and this fall he will show a further 10% of Ford's 53,000 salaried staff the door. Nasser also has a flair for car design and has reinvigorated Ford's overseas operations."[16]
Fortune in June 1998 described Nasser as "heir apparent" to Ford CEO Alex Trotman, who was soon to retire.[13] The projected high-profile appointment met with a great deal of attention in the press, and largely positive reactions.[13] Before the role was finalized, Robert A. Lutz of Chrysler categorized Nasser as a "brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker" and opined "they'd be crazy not to give him the top job."[7] The president of BMW North America stated Nasser had energy and ideas but had "to avoid diluting Ford's brands-but I suspect he understands that."[13] On 1 January 1999,[16] Nasser became president and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan.[17] At the time Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment by the simultaneously appointed chairman Bill Ford.[18] Nasser announced that he would transform Ford, according to The Economist, "from a boring old car maker" into a "consumer-products and services company".[19] He stated he would work to help Ford surpass GM in US market share, and would also try to make Ford less reliant on pickup truck sales.[13]
Initial changes at Ford (1999)[edit]
See also: Premier Automotive Group
Nasser promptly instituted a number of changes as CEO, closing plants that were losing money and selling unprofitable operations. He also instituted a new human resources policy[7] mandating that 10 percent of low-performing managers could be subject to termination, arguing that new people and turnover were good for the company.[7][20] He also instituted a program that gave internet access and home computers to employees.[7] Beyond human resources, Nasser's other focus was brand management,[19] and under Nasser's watch, in 1999 Ford formed Premier Automotive Group (PAG) to expand its market share in the luxury segment.[21][15] PAG was formed to oversee the business operations of Ford's high-end automotive marques,[22] and it grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands.[23] To reinvigorate certain brand lines, Nasser brought in car designer J Mays.[18] He also oversaw Ford's 1999 acquisition of Volvo for $6.45 billion, LandRover for $2.8 billion, and helped Ford start an "automotive e-business integrated supply chain."[24][25][26]
He diversified Ford's businesses to include e-commerce, junkyards, auto-repair shops,[18] and car distribution among others.[21][15] By August 1999, The Economist clarified that Nasser had already acquired the Kwik-Fit exhausts-and-brakes chain in Europe, American scrapyard businesses, the consumer-finance arm of Japan's Mazda, and had "even signed a deal to provide drivers with satellite-fed audio and other services for a monthly fee." The Economist pointed out the diversification was an attempt to increase profit margins, as "whereas car makers are lucky to scrape operating margins of more than 5% from actually making cars, other businesses such as leasing, renting, insurance, finance and car repair, can all achieve margins of 10-15%."[19] Also, by late 1999 Nasser was working to sell the underperforming in-house parts company, Visteon.[19] Ford of North America began marketing the Ford Focus in October 1999 for the 2000 model year as a surprise Christmas present for Nasser, with some changes from the European version.[27] Ford's profits in 1999 were USD $6.5 billion ($A9.94 billion), which Drive.com claims was the largest "ever made in the world car industry."[14]
Disputes and Firestone (2000–2001)[edit]
According to CNN, Nasser was "point man" in the dispute between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety.[15] After an investigation in early 2000 found that tread separation on Firestone tires[15] had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers,[22] Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall[22] allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others.[28] Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer as one of the safer SUVs on the market.[29] On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub-committee on the recall.[22] Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault.[22] On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, aruging Ford's tire recall was "casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires."[30] After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year,[31] with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion[14] of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles.[15] The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices.[14]
By late 2001, Nasser's efforts to diversify Ford's core business had met with mixed reactions in the press,[21][15] with analysts at The Economist and CNN arguing that diversification and recent recalls had hampered productivity.[21][15] Nasser's manager evaluation system had also proved controversial at Ford,[7] with allegations of reverse discrimination.[32] In July 2001, Nasser announced that the system was being changed[33] to "allow for more flexibility."[33] Ford settled several lawsuits over the system in late 2001 without admitting liability.[32] In October 2001,[24] the 53-year-old Nasser[14] retired from his position as Ford's CEO.[24] He was succeeded in both positions by William Clay Ford Jr,[24] who as Henry Ford's great-grandson had previously been chairman[16] and president.[14]
Recent positions (2010–present)[edit]
See also: BHP Billiton
In February 2001, Nasser became a member of the International Advisory Council of Allianz Aktiengeselischaft.[17] The following year he became a senior partner at One Equity Partners,[7] the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. Nasser was involved in 2006 when One Equity speculated on bidding for Jaguar Cars and Premier Automotive Group. [34] He also would serve as chairman of One Equity's Polaroid Corporation subsidiary[34] starting in July 2002,[7] before selling the company in 2005.[3] He remained a One Equity partner until 2014.[17] Nasser was on the board of British Sky Broadcasting from November 2002 to November 2012[17] and he served on the board of BuyTV.com.[7] In 2004, he began a four-year tenure on the board of directors at Brambles Limited, an Australian logistics company. In June 2006 he was appointed to the board the Australian mining company BHP Billiton, specifically BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc.[17]
He was elected as the next chairman of BHP Billiton in March 2010,[35] ending an 18-month search[36] to find a replacement for the retiring Don Argus.[37] The Wall Street Journal claimed that "analysts welcomed the appointment," and that Nasser had possibly been selected because BHP was "looking for the stability of another long-term chairman."[38] The Australian opined the next day that Nasser was "the right guy to lead BHP Billiton in the post-Argus era,"[9] writing about his time at Ford that "Nasser spent a good 15 years delivering Ford, with some internal reluctance, leadership of the reform agenda in the motor industry...Nasser is one reason why Ford is the one US major not to put its hand out for government money in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis."[9] He officially became chairman of BHP Billiton[17] on 13 March 2010.[17] Over the following years Nasser would help implement a number of policy changes at BHP, including a large demerger and a cap on growth projects.[2] Nasser also focused on maintaining the company's long-term financial goals, working to keep the balance sheet stable during a global downturn in the metals and oil markets, and revising the company's progressive annual dividend policy,[39] which The Australian Financial Review dubbed strategic for the "new era."[40]
On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the "most powerful people in Australian boardrooms."[1] At the time, Nasser ranked No. 18 on the Optimice Market Capitalisation Influence Index and at No. 17 on the MCII connectedness index.[1] He became a board member at 21st Century Fox in June 2013.[17] On 2 August 2015, it was confirmed that Nasser had joined the board of Koç Holding [2][17] a large Turkey-based conglomerate.[2] After the deadly Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil on 5 November 2015,[41] Nasser announced that BHP would be permitting an external investigation into the incident, with findings to be released publicly.[42]
In June 2017, BHP annonced that Nasser will be replaced by Ken MacKenzie as chairman effective on 1 September 2017.[43][44]
Honors and philanthropy[edit]
Nasser was named 'Automobile Industries Man of the Year' in 1999 by the Retail Motor Industry Organization.[7] In 2002[7] he was named an officer[4] of the National Order of the Cedar,[3] the highest honor in Lebanon.[4] Also that year Nasser[7] was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal for "his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology."[3] The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Nasser the Ellis Island Medal of Honor,[3] which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants.[5]
Nasser funds several scholarship programs[6] that assist individual students, including the Jacques Nasser Scholarship in Entrepreneurship at RMIT University in Melbourne, the Jacques Nasser Scholarship for MBA students at the American University of Beirut, and the Jacques Nasser Scholarship at the INSEAD School of Business.[3][third-party source needed] He also has been known to support organizations such as Focus: HOPE, a training center in Detroit.[3][third-party source needed]
Personal life[edit]
Nasser and his ex-wife Jennifer,[13] also an Australian,[7] married in 1970[13] and have four children together.[3][14] By 2009[38] Nasser was based primarily out of his home in Michigan,[1] though after becoming chairman of BHP Billiton[38] in 2010 he began spending equal time in Australia,[9] also having properties in New York City, London, and Melbourne. Described as a fan of racing,[13] Nasser has served as a periodic judge at Concours d'Elegance events.[45]
He has Australian-American dual citizenship, and is nicknamed "Jac".[11] He owns a 1961 Lincoln Continental. He has a sister named Betty.[46]

Early life and education[edit]
Jacques "Jac" A. Nasser was born in the city of Amyoun,[7] Lebanon[8] on 27 December 1947.[7] He is the son of a bus driver[9] and independent businessman, Abdo Nasser,[7] who served with the Australian armed forces in Lebanon during the second world war.[citation needed][10] At four years of age Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia.[3] He attended Northcote High School. He started a number of businesses as a teenager, including a bicycle-making operation[7] and several discotheques,[7] which he promoted in Melbourne[1] with his brother Jamie.[9] Nasser's first professional experience was at Ford of Australia as a student intern.[7] He graduated with a business degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1968,[11][7] where he would later be awarded with an honorary doctorate of technology.[12] He speaks four languages:[13] English, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese.[12]
Business career[edit]
Early Ford positions (1968–1997)[edit]
See also: Ford Motor Company
Upon graduating,[7] in 1968 the 20-year-old Nasser joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst,[3] working at the head office in Australia.[14] In 1973 he joined Ford's global financial staff and transferred to Ford's North American Truck Operations in the United States.[3] Afterwards, he returned to Australia to work as a manager of product programming and financial analysis, before joining Ford's International Automotive Operations.[3] While with the international division, he helped oversee Asia-Pacific and Latin American operations.[7] While working in Argentina, Nasser was notably kidnapped by political extremists, being returned to the Ford plant two days later.[11]
Nasser helped in the negotiations of Ford's South African joint venture program in 1982.[12] The following year, he developed a business and operating plan for Ford's Hermosillo Assembly Plant in Mexico.[12] In 1987 Nasser became the first director and vice president of Autolatina,[12] a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina.[3][7]
While remaining in charge of Autolatina,[3] in 1989 he also took charge of Ford Australia, where he had started his career.[14] He remained president and CEO of Ford Australia until 1993,[7] where he picked up the corporate nicknames "Jac the Knife" for costcutting[14] efforts with Ford's supplier base.[15] He was also dubbed "Black Jack" for his ability to keep numbers north of red.[13] On 1 January 1993, Nasser was elected chairman of the board of Ford Europe,[12] a role he maintained until 1996.[7] He was promoted to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993 as well,[12][3] becoming Ford's group vice president of product development in 1994.[3] While in his position of Ford's VP, Fortune writes that he developed a reputation for working 18 hour days and regularly interacting with Ford employees via a newsletter. Wrote Fortune about his time as VP, "if Ford is a religion, then Nasser is the head preacher."[13]
VP and CEO appointments (1996–1999)[edit]
On 1 November 1996,[12] he began heading Ford Automotive Operations.[15] Nasser was the featured speaker at the 1998 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS).[12] Bloomberg Businessweek described Nasser in late 1998 as a "scrappy, hard-nosed cost-cutter who is widely credited with Ford's turnaround." The magazine further opined that since becoming Ford's automotive president in October 1996, "the blunt-talking Australian has transformed Ford from struggling with the worst profit margins in the business to scoring record earnings last year - surpassing General Motors. Nasser has slashed over $4 billion in costs in the past 18 months... and this fall he will show a further 10% of Ford's 53,000 salaried staff the door. Nasser also has a flair for car design and has reinvigorated Ford's overseas operations."[16]
Fortune in June 1998 described Nasser as "heir apparent" to Ford CEO Alex Trotman, who was soon to retire.[13] The projected high-profile appointment met with a great deal of attention in the press, and largely positive reactions.[13] Before the role was finalized, Robert A. Lutz of Chrysler categorized Nasser as a "brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker" and opined "they'd be crazy not to give him the top job."[7] The president of BMW North America stated Nasser had energy and ideas but had "to avoid diluting Ford's brands-but I suspect he understands that."[13] On 1 January 1999,[16] Nasser became president and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan.[17] At the time Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment by the simultaneously appointed chairman Bill Ford.[18] Nasser announced that he would transform Ford, according to The Economist, "from a boring old car maker" into a "consumer-products and services company".[19] He stated he would work to help Ford surpass GM in US market share, and would also try to make Ford less reliant on pickup truck sales.[13]
Initial changes at Ford (1999)[edit]
See also: Premier Automotive Group
Nasser promptly instituted a number of changes as CEO, closing plants that were losing money and selling unprofitable operations. He also instituted a new human resources policy[7] mandating that 10 percent of low-performing managers could be subject to termination, arguing that new people and turnover were good for the company.[7][20] He also instituted a program that gave internet access and home computers to employees.[7] Beyond human resources, Nasser's other focus was brand management,[19] and under Nasser's watch, in 1999 Ford formed Premier Automotive Group (PAG) to expand its market share in the luxury segment.[21][15] PAG was formed to oversee the business operations of Ford's high-end automotive marques,[22] and it grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands.[23] To reinvigorate certain brand lines, Nasser brought in car designer J Mays.[18] He also oversaw Ford's 1999 acquisition of Volvo for $6.45 billion, LandRover for $2.8 billion, and helped Ford start an "automotive e-business integrated supply chain."[24][25][26]
He diversified Ford's businesses to include e-commerce, junkyards, auto-repair shops,[18] and car distribution among others.[21][15] By August 1999, The Economist clarified that Nasser had already acquired the Kwik-Fit exhausts-and-brakes chain in Europe, American scrapyard businesses, the consumer-finance arm of Japan's Mazda, and had "even signed a deal to provide drivers with satellite-fed audio and other services for a monthly fee." The Economist pointed out the diversification was an attempt to increase profit margins, as "whereas car makers are lucky to scrape operating margins of more than 5% from actually making cars, other businesses such as leasing, renting, insurance, finance and car repair, can all achieve margins of 10-15%."[19] Also, by late 1999 Nasser was working to sell the underperforming in-house parts company, Visteon.[19] Ford of North America began marketing the Ford Focus in October 1999 for the 2000 model year as a surprise Christmas present for Nasser, with some changes from the European version.[27] Ford's profits in 1999 were USD $6.5 billion ($A9.94 billion), which Drive.com claims was the largest "ever made in the world car industry."[14]
Disputes and Firestone (2000–2001)[edit]
According to CNN, Nasser was "point man" in the dispute between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety.[15] After an investigation in early 2000 found that tread separation on Firestone tires[15] had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers,[22] Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall[22] allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others.[28] Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer as one of the safer SUVs on the market.[29] On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub-committee on the recall.[22] Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault.[22] On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, aruging Ford's tire recall was "casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires."[30] After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year,[31] with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion[14] of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles.[15] The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices.[14]
By late 2001, Nasser's efforts to diversify Ford's core business had met with mixed reactions in the press,[21][15] with analysts at The Economist and CNN arguing that diversification and recent recalls had hampered productivity.[21][15] Nasser's manager evaluation system had also proved controversial at Ford,[7] with allegations of reverse discrimination.[32] In July 2001, Nasser announced that the system was being changed[33] to "allow for more flexibility."[33] Ford settled several lawsuits over the system in late 2001 without admitting liability.[32] In October 2001,[24] the 53-year-old Nasser[14] retired from his position as Ford's CEO.[24] He was succeeded in both positions by William Clay Ford Jr,[24] who as Henry Ford's great-grandson had previously been chairman[16] and president.[14]
Recent positions (2010–present)[edit]
See also: BHP Billiton
In February 2001, Nasser became a member of the International Advisory Council of Allianz Aktiengeselischaft.[17] The following year he became a senior partner at One Equity Partners,[7] the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. Nasser was involved in 2006 when One Equity speculated on bidding for Jaguar Cars and Premier Automotive Group. [34] He also would serve as chairman of One Equity's Polaroid Corporation subsidiary[34] starting in July 2002,[7] before selling the company in 2005.[3] He remained a One Equity partner until 2014.[17] Nasser was on the board of British Sky Broadcasting from November 2002 to November 2012[17] and he served on the board of BuyTV.com.[7] In 2004, he began a four-year tenure on the board of directors at Brambles Limited, an Australian logistics company. In June 2006 he was appointed to the board the Australian mining company BHP Billiton, specifically BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc.[17]
He was elected as the next chairman of BHP Billiton in March 2010,[35] ending an 18-month search[36] to find a replacement for the retiring Don Argus.[37] The Wall Street Journal claimed that "analysts welcomed the appointment," and that Nasser had possibly been selected because BHP was "looking for the stability of another long-term chairman."[38] The Australian opined the next day that Nasser was "the right guy to lead BHP Billiton in the post-Argus era,"[9] writing about his time at Ford that "Nasser spent a good 15 years delivering Ford, with some internal reluctance, leadership of the reform agenda in the motor industry...Nasser is one reason why Ford is the one US major not to put its hand out for government money in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis."[9] He officially became chairman of BHP Billiton[17] on 13 March 2010.[17] Over the following years Nasser would help implement a number of policy changes at BHP, including a large demerger and a cap on growth projects.[2] Nasser also focused on maintaining the company's long-term financial goals, working to keep the balance sheet stable during a global downturn in the metals and oil markets, and revising the company's progressive annual dividend policy,[39] which The Australian Financial Review dubbed strategic for the "new era."[40]
On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the "most powerful people in Australian boardrooms."[1] At the time, Nasser ranked No. 18 on the Optimice Market Capitalisation Influence Index and at No. 17 on the MCII connectedness index.[1] He became a board member at 21st Century Fox in June 2013.[17] On 2 August 2015, it was confirmed that Nasser had joined the board of Koç Holding [2][17] a large Turkey-based conglomerate.[2] After the deadly Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil on 5 November 2015,[41] Nasser announced that BHP would be permitting an external investigation into the incident, with findings to be released publicly.[42]
In June 2017, BHP annonced that Nasser will be replaced by Ken MacKenzie as chairman effective on 1 September 2017.[43][44]
Honors and philanthropy[edit]
Nasser was named 'Automobile Industries Man of the Year' in 1999 by the Retail Motor Industry Organization.[7] In 2002[7] he was named an officer[4] of the National Order of the Cedar,[3] the highest honor in Lebanon.[4] Also that year Nasser[7] was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal for "his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology."[3] The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Nasser the Ellis Island Medal of Honor,[3] which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants.[5]
Nasser funds several scholarship programs[6] that assist individual students, including the Jacques Nasser Scholarship in Entrepreneurship at RMIT University in Melbourne, the Jacques Nasser Scholarship for MBA students at the American University of Beirut, and the Jacques Nasser Scholarship at the INSEAD School of Business.[3][third-party source needed] He also has been known to support organizations such as Focus: HOPE, a training center in Detroit.[3][third-party source needed]
Personal life[edit]
Nasser and his ex-wife Jennifer,[13] also an Australian,[7] married in 1970[13] and have four children together.[3][14] By 2009[38] Nasser was based primarily out of his home in Michigan,[1] though after becoming chairman of BHP Billiton[38] in 2010 he began spending equal time in Australia,[9] also having properties in New York City, London, and Melbourne. Described as a fan of racing,[13] Nasser has served as a periodic judge at Concours d'Elegance events.[45]
He has Australian-American dual citizenship, and is nicknamed "Jac".[11] He owns a 1961 Lincoln Continental. He has a sister named Betty.[46]

Early life and education[edit]
Jacques "Jac" A. Nasser was born in the city of Amyoun,[7] Lebanon[8] on 27 December 1947.[7] He is the son of a bus driver[9] and independent businessman, Abdo Nasser,[7] who served with the Australian armed forces in Lebanon during the second world war.[citation needed][10] At four years of age Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia.[3] He attended Northcote High School. He started a number of businesses as a teenager, including a bicycle-making operation[7] and several discotheques,[7] which he promoted in Melbourne[1] with his brother Jamie.[9] Nasser's first professional experience was at Ford of Australia as a student intern.[7] He graduated with a business degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1968,[11][7] where he would later be awarded with an honorary doctorate of technology.[12] He speaks four languages:[13] English, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese.[12]
Business career[edit]
Early Ford positions (1968–1997)[edit]
See also: Ford Motor Company
Upon graduating,[7] in 1968 the 20-year-old Nasser joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst,[3] working at the head office in Australia.[14] In 1973 he joined Ford's global financial staff and transferred to Ford's North American Truck Operations in the United States.[3] Afterwards, he returned to Australia to work as a manager of product programming and financial analysis, before joining Ford's International Automotive Operations.[3] While with the international division, he helped oversee Asia-Pacific and Latin American operations.[7] While working in Argentina, Nasser was notably kidnapped by political extremists, being returned to the Ford plant two days later.[11]
Nasser helped in the negotiations of Ford's South African joint venture program in 1982.[12] The following year, he developed a business and operating plan for Ford's Hermosillo Assembly Plant in Mexico.[12] In 1987 Nasser became the first director and vice president of Autolatina,[12] a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina.[3][7]
While remaining in charge of Autolatina,[3] in 1989 he also took charge of Ford Australia, where he had started his career.[14] He remained president and CEO of Ford Australia until 1993,[7] where he picked up the corporate nicknames "Jac the Knife" for costcutting[14] efforts with Ford's supplier base.[15] He was also dubbed "Black Jack" for his ability to keep numbers north of red.[13] On 1 January 1993, Nasser was elected chairman of the board of Ford Europe,[12] a role he maintained until 1996.[7] He was promoted to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993 as well,[12][3] becoming Ford's group vice president of product development in 1994.[3] While in his position of Ford's VP, Fortune writes that he developed a reputation for working 18 hour days and regularly interacting with Ford employees via a newsletter. Wrote Fortune about his time as VP, "if Ford is a religion, then Nasser is the head preacher."[13]
VP and CEO appointments (1996–1999)[edit]
On 1 November 1996,[12] he began heading Ford Automotive Operations.[15] Nasser was the featured speaker at the 1998 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS).[12] Bloomberg Businessweek described Nasser in late 1998 as a "scrappy, hard-nosed cost-cutter who is widely credited with Ford's turnaround." The magazine further opined that since becoming Ford's automotive president in October 1996, "the blunt-talking Australian has transformed Ford from struggling with the worst profit margins in the business to scoring record earnings last year - surpassing General Motors. Nasser has slashed over $4 billion in costs in the past 18 months... and this fall he will show a further 10% of Ford's 53,000 salaried staff the door. Nasser also has a flair for car design and has reinvigorated Ford's overseas operations."[16]
Fortune in June 1998 described Nasser as "heir apparent" to Ford CEO Alex Trotman, who was soon to retire.[13] The projected high-profile appointment met with a great deal of attention in the press, and largely positive reactions.[13] Before the role was finalized, Robert A. Lutz of Chrysler categorized Nasser as a "brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker" and opined "they'd be crazy not to give him the top job."[7] The president of BMW North America stated Nasser had energy and ideas but had "to avoid diluting Ford's brands-but I suspect he understands that."[13] On 1 January 1999,[16] Nasser became president and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan.[17] At the time Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment by the simultaneously appointed chairman Bill Ford.[18] Nasser announced that he would transform Ford, according to The Economist, "from a boring old car maker" into a "consumer-products and services company".[19] He stated he would work to help Ford surpass GM in US market share, and would also try to make Ford less reliant on pickup truck sales.[13]
Initial changes at Ford (1999)[edit]
See also: Premier Automotive Group
Nasser promptly instituted a number of changes as CEO, closing plants that were losing money and selling unprofitable operations. He also instituted a new human resources policy[7] mandating that 10 percent of low-performing managers could be subject to termination, arguing that new people and turnover were good for the company.[7][20] He also instituted a program that gave internet access and home computers to employees.[7] Beyond human resources, Nasser's other focus was brand management,[19] and under Nasser's watch, in 1999 Ford formed Premier Automotive Group (PAG) to expand its market share in the luxury segment.[21][15] PAG was formed to oversee the business operations of Ford's high-end automotive marques,[22] and it grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands.[23] To reinvigorate certain brand lines, Nasser brought in car designer J Mays.[18] He also oversaw Ford's 1999 acquisition of Volvo for $6.45 billion, LandRover for $2.8 billion, and helped Ford start an "automotive e-business integrated supply chain."[24][25][26]
He diversified Ford's businesses to include e-commerce, junkyards, auto-repair shops,[18] and car distribution among others.[21][15] By August 1999, The Economist clarified that Nasser had already acquired the Kwik-Fit exhausts-and-brakes chain in Europe, American scrapyard businesses, the consumer-finance arm of Japan's Mazda, and had "even signed a deal to provide drivers with satellite-fed audio and other services for a monthly fee." The Economist pointed out the diversification was an attempt to increase profit margins, as "whereas car makers are lucky to scrape operating margins of more than 5% from actually making cars, other businesses such as leasing, renting, insurance, finance and car repair, can all achieve margins of 10-15%."[19] Also, by late 1999 Nasser was working to sell the underperforming in-house parts company, Visteon.[19] Ford of North America began marketing the Ford Focus in October 1999 for the 2000 model year as a surprise Christmas present for Nasser, with some changes from the European version.[27] Ford's profits in 1999 were USD $6.5 billion ($A9.94 billion), which Drive.com claims was the largest "ever made in the world car industry."[14]
Disputes and Firestone (2000–2001)[edit]
According to CNN, Nasser was "point man" in the dispute between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety.[15] After an investigation in early 2000 found that tread separation on Firestone tires[15] had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers,[22] Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall[22] allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others.[28] Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer as one of the safer SUVs on the market.[29] On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub-committee on the recall.[22] Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault.[22] On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, aruging Ford's tire recall was "casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires."[30] After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year,[31] with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion[14] of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles.[15] The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices.[14]
By late 2001, Nasser's efforts to diversify Ford's core business had met with mixed reactions in the press,[21][15] with analysts at The Economist and CNN arguing that diversification and recent recalls had hampered productivity.[21][15] Nasser's manager evaluation system had also proved controversial at Ford,[7] with allegations of reverse discrimination.[32] In July 2001, Nasser announced that the system was being changed[33] to "allow for more flexibility."[33] Ford settled several lawsuits over the system in late 2001 without admitting liability.[32] In October 2001,[24] the 53-year-old Nasser[14] retired from his position as Ford's CEO.[24] He was succeeded in both positions by William Clay Ford Jr,[24] who as Henry Ford's great-grandson had previously been chairman[16] and president.[14]
Recent positions (2010–present)[edit]
See also: BHP Billiton
In February 2001, Nasser became a member of the International Advisory Council of Allianz Aktiengeselischaft.[17] The following year he became a senior partner at One Equity Partners,[7] the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. Nasser was involved in 2006 when One Equity speculated on bidding for Jaguar Cars and Premier Automotive Group. [34] He also would serve as chairman of One Equity's Polaroid Corporation subsidiary[34] starting in July 2002,[7] before selling the company in 2005.[3] He remained a One Equity partner until 2014.[17] Nasser was on the board of British Sky Broadcasting from November 2002 to November 2012[17] and he served on the board of BuyTV.com.[7] In 2004, he began a four-year tenure on the board of directors at Brambles Limited, an Australian logistics company. In June 2006 he was appointed to the board the Australian mining company BHP Billiton, specifically BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc.[17]
He was elected as the next chairman of BHP Billiton in March 2010,[35] ending an 18-month search[36] to find a replacement for the retiring Don Argus.[37] The Wall Street Journal claimed that "analysts welcomed the appointment," and that Nasser had possibly been selected because BHP was "looking for the stability of another long-term chairman."[38] The Australian opined the next day that Nasser was "the right guy to lead BHP Billiton in the post-Argus era,"[9] writing about his time at Ford that "Nasser spent a good 15 years delivering Ford, with some internal reluctance, leadership of the reform agenda in the motor industry...Nasser is one reason why Ford is the one US major not to put its hand out for government money in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis."[9] He officially became chairman of BHP Billiton[17] on 13 March 2010.[17] Over the following years Nasser would help implement a number of policy changes at BHP, including a large demerger and a cap on growth projects.[2] Nasser also focused on maintaining the company's long-term financial goals, working to keep the balance sheet stable during a global downturn in the metals and oil markets, and revising the company's progressive annual dividend policy,[39] which The Australian Financial Review dubbed strategic for the "new era."[40]
On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the "most powerful people in Australian boardrooms."[1] At the time, Nasser ranked No. 18 on the Optimice Market Capitalisation Influence Index and at No. 17 on the MCII connectedness index.[1] He became a board member at 21st Century Fox in June 2013.[17] On 2 August 2015, it was confirmed that Nasser had joined the board of Koç Holding [2][17] a large Turkey-based conglomerate.[2] After the deadly Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil on 5 November 2015,[41] Nasser announced that BHP would be permitting an external investigation into the incident, with findings to be released publicly.[42]
In June 2017, BHP annonced that Nasser will be replaced by Ken MacKenzie as chairman effective on 1 September 2017.[43][44]
Honors and philanthropy[edit]
Nasser was named 'Automobile Industries Man of the Year' in 1999 by the Retail Motor Industry Organization.[7] In 2002[7] he was named an officer[4] of the National Order of the Cedar,[3] the highest honor in Lebanon.[4] Also that year Nasser[7] was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal for "his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology."[3] The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Nasser the Ellis Island Medal of Honor,[3] which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants.[5]
Nasser funds several scholarship programs[6] that assist individual students, including the Jacques Nasser Scholarship in Entrepreneurship at RMIT University in Melbourne, the Jacques Nasser Scholarship for MBA students at the American University of Beirut, and the Jacques Nasser Scholarship at the INSEAD School of Business.[3][third-party source needed] He also has been known to support organizations such as Focus: HOPE, a training center in Detroit.[3][third-party source needed]
Personal life[edit]
Nasser and his ex-wife Jennifer,[13] also an Australian,[7] married in 1970[13] and have four children together.[3][14] By 2009[38] Nasser was based primarily out of his home in Michigan,[1] though after becoming chairman of BHP Billiton[38] in 2010 he began spending equal time in Australia,[9] also having properties in New York City, London, and Melbourne. Described as a fan of racing,[13] Nasser has served as a periodic judge at Concours d'Elegance events.[45]
He has Australian-American dual citizenship, and is nicknamed "Jac".[11] He owns a 1961 Lincoln Continental. He has a sister named Betty.[46]

Early life and education[edit]
Jacques "Jac" A. Nasser was born in the city of Amyoun,[7] Lebanon[8] on 27 December 1947.[7] He is the son of a bus driver[9] and independent businessman, Abdo Nasser,[7] who served with the Australian armed forces in Lebanon during the second world war.[citation needed][10] At four years of age Nasser moved with his family to Melbourne, Australia.[3] He attended Northcote High School. He started a number of businesses as a teenager, including a bicycle-making operation[7] and several discotheques,[7] which he promoted in Melbourne[1] with his brother Jamie.[9] Nasser's first professional experience was at Ford of Australia as a student intern.[7] He graduated with a business degree from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Melbourne in 1968,[11][7] where he would later be awarded with an honorary doctorate of technology.[12] He speaks four languages:[13] English, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese.[12]
Business career[edit]
Early Ford positions (1968–1997)[edit]
See also: Ford Motor Company
Upon graduating,[7] in 1968 the 20-year-old Nasser joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst,[3] working at the head office in Australia.[14] In 1973 he joined Ford's global financial staff and transferred to Ford's North American Truck Operations in the United States.[3] Afterwards, he returned to Australia to work as a manager of product programming and financial analysis, before joining Ford's International Automotive Operations.[3] While with the international division, he helped oversee Asia-Pacific and Latin American operations.[7] While working in Argentina, Nasser was notably kidnapped by political extremists, being returned to the Ford plant two days later.[11]
Nasser helped in the negotiations of Ford's South African joint venture program in 1982.[12] The following year, he developed a business and operating plan for Ford's Hermosillo Assembly Plant in Mexico.[12] In 1987 Nasser became the first director and vice president of Autolatina,[12] a joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina.[3][7]
While remaining in charge of Autolatina,[3] in 1989 he also took charge of Ford Australia, where he had started his career.[14] He remained president and CEO of Ford Australia until 1993,[7] where he picked up the corporate nicknames "Jac the Knife" for costcutting[14] efforts with Ford's supplier base.[15] He was also dubbed "Black Jack" for his ability to keep numbers north of red.[13] On 1 January 1993, Nasser was elected chairman of the board of Ford Europe,[12] a role he maintained until 1996.[7] He was promoted to vice president of Ford Motor Company in 1993 as well,[12][3] becoming Ford's group vice president of product development in 1994.[3] While in his position of Ford's VP, Fortune writes that he developed a reputation for working 18 hour days and regularly interacting with Ford employees via a newsletter. Wrote Fortune about his time as VP, "if Ford is a religion, then Nasser is the head preacher."[13]
VP and CEO appointments (1996–1999)[edit]
On 1 November 1996,[12] he began heading Ford Automotive Operations.[15] Nasser was the featured speaker at the 1998 New York International Auto Show (NYIAS).[12] Bloomberg Businessweek described Nasser in late 1998 as a "scrappy, hard-nosed cost-cutter who is widely credited with Ford's turnaround." The magazine further opined that since becoming Ford's automotive president in October 1996, "the blunt-talking Australian has transformed Ford from struggling with the worst profit margins in the business to scoring record earnings last year - surpassing General Motors. Nasser has slashed over $4 billion in costs in the past 18 months... and this fall he will show a further 10% of Ford's 53,000 salaried staff the door. Nasser also has a flair for car design and has reinvigorated Ford's overseas operations."[16]
Fortune in June 1998 described Nasser as "heir apparent" to Ford CEO Alex Trotman, who was soon to retire.[13] The projected high-profile appointment met with a great deal of attention in the press, and largely positive reactions.[13] Before the role was finalized, Robert A. Lutz of Chrysler categorized Nasser as a "brilliant automotive executive and unconventional thinker" and opined "they'd be crazy not to give him the top job."[7] The president of BMW North America stated Nasser had energy and ideas but had "to avoid diluting Ford's brands-but I suspect he understands that."[13] On 1 January 1999,[16] Nasser became president and CEO, as well as a member of the board of directors, of Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan.[17] At the time Ford was the world's most profitable automaker, with profits of $7.2 billion on sales of $163 billion, so he was given free rein to experiment by the simultaneously appointed chairman Bill Ford.[18] Nasser announced that he would transform Ford, according to The Economist, "from a boring old car maker" into a "consumer-products and services company".[19] He stated he would work to help Ford surpass GM in US market share, and would also try to make Ford less reliant on pickup truck sales.[13]
Initial changes at Ford (1999)[edit]
See also: Premier Automotive Group
Nasser promptly instituted a number of changes as CEO, closing plants that were losing money and selling unprofitable operations. He also instituted a new human resources policy[7] mandating that 10 percent of low-performing managers could be subject to termination, arguing that new people and turnover were good for the company.[7][20] He also instituted a program that gave internet access and home computers to employees.[7] Beyond human resources, Nasser's other focus was brand management,[19] and under Nasser's watch, in 1999 Ford formed Premier Automotive Group (PAG) to expand its market share in the luxury segment.[21][15] PAG was formed to oversee the business operations of Ford's high-end automotive marques,[22] and it grew to include responsibility for the Lincoln, Mercury, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo brands.[23] To reinvigorate certain brand lines, Nasser brought in car designer J Mays.[18] He also oversaw Ford's 1999 acquisition of Volvo for $6.45 billion, LandRover for $2.8 billion, and helped Ford start an "automotive e-business integrated supply chain."[24][25][26]
He diversified Ford's businesses to include e-commerce, junkyards, auto-repair shops,[18] and car distribution among others.[21][15] By August 1999, The Economist clarified that Nasser had already acquired the Kwik-Fit exhausts-and-brakes chain in Europe, American scrapyard businesses, the consumer-finance arm of Japan's Mazda, and had "even signed a deal to provide drivers with satellite-fed audio and other services for a monthly fee." The Economist pointed out the diversification was an attempt to increase profit margins, as "whereas car makers are lucky to scrape operating margins of more than 5% from actually making cars, other businesses such as leasing, renting, insurance, finance and car repair, can all achieve margins of 10-15%."[19] Also, by late 1999 Nasser was working to sell the underperforming in-house parts company, Visteon.[19] Ford of North America began marketing the Ford Focus in October 1999 for the 2000 model year as a surprise Christmas present for Nasser, with some changes from the European version.[27] Ford's profits in 1999 were USD $6.5 billion ($A9.94 billion), which Drive.com claims was the largest "ever made in the world car industry."[14]
Disputes and Firestone (2000–2001)[edit]
According to CNN, Nasser was "point man" in the dispute between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. over tire safety.[15] After an investigation in early 2000 found that tread separation on Firestone tires[15] had led to fatalities in some Ford Explorers,[22] Nasser appeared on prime-time television to announce a product recall[22] allowing Ford owners to change the affected tires for others.[28] Firestone responded by arguing that Ford Explorers had caused the accidents, not its tires, while Nasser defended the Explorer as one of the safer SUVs on the market.[29] On 6 September 2000, Nasser and Bridgestone executive Masatoshi Ono confronted a US Congressional sub-committee on the recall.[22] Dispute arose in the hearings over whether Ford and Firestone had known about similar problems in the 1970s and 1990s. Nasser again denied that Ford had responsibility in the accidents, with Ono admitting some fault.[22] On 22 May 2001, Bridgestone's CEO wrote to Nasser canceling the 100-year supply relationship between their companies, aruging Ford's tire recall was "casting doubt on the quality of Firestone tires."[30] After numerous class action lawsuits, Firestone ultimately recalled millions of tires later that year,[31] with Ford Motor using AUS$4.4 billion[14] of its own funds to replace Firestone tires on its vehicles.[15] The scandal helped lead to a sharp dip in Ford's 2001 quarterly share prices.[14]
By late 2001, Nasser's efforts to diversify Ford's core business had met with mixed reactions in the press,[21][15] with analysts at The Economist and CNN arguing that diversification and recent recalls had hampered productivity.[21][15] Nasser's manager evaluation system had also proved controversial at Ford,[7] with allegations of reverse discrimination.[32] In July 2001, Nasser announced that the system was being changed[33] to "allow for more flexibility."[33] Ford settled several lawsuits over the system in late 2001 without admitting liability.[32] In October 2001,[24] the 53-year-old Nasser[14] retired from his position as Ford's CEO.[24] He was succeeded in both positions by William Clay Ford Jr,[24] who as Henry Ford's great-grandson had previously been chairman[16] and president.[14]
Recent positions (2010–present)[edit]
See also: BHP Billiton
In February 2001, Nasser became a member of the International Advisory Council of Allianz Aktiengeselischaft.[17] The following year he became a senior partner at One Equity Partners,[7] the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase. Nasser was involved in 2006 when One Equity speculated on bidding for Jaguar Cars and Premier Automotive Group. [34] He also would serve as chairman of One Equity's Polaroid Corporation subsidiary[34] starting in July 2002,[7] before selling the company in 2005.[3] He remained a One Equity partner until 2014.[17] Nasser was on the board of British Sky Broadcasting from November 2002 to November 2012[17] and he served on the board of BuyTV.com.[7] In 2004, he began a four-year tenure on the board of directors at Brambles Limited, an Australian logistics company. In June 2006 he was appointed to the board the Australian mining company BHP Billiton, specifically BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc.[17]
He was elected as the next chairman of BHP Billiton in March 2010,[35] ending an 18-month search[36] to find a replacement for the retiring Don Argus.[37] The Wall Street Journal claimed that "analysts welcomed the appointment," and that Nasser had possibly been selected because BHP was "looking for the stability of another long-term chairman."[38] The Australian opined the next day that Nasser was "the right guy to lead BHP Billiton in the post-Argus era,"[9] writing about his time at Ford that "Nasser spent a good 15 years delivering Ford, with some internal reluctance, leadership of the reform agenda in the motor industry...Nasser is one reason why Ford is the one US major not to put its hand out for government money in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis."[9] He officially became chairman of BHP Billiton[17] on 13 March 2010.[17] Over the following years Nasser would help implement a number of policy changes at BHP, including a large demerger and a cap on growth projects.[2] Nasser also focused on maintaining the company's long-term financial goals, working to keep the balance sheet stable during a global downturn in the metals and oil markets, and revising the company's progressive annual dividend policy,[39] which The Australian Financial Review dubbed strategic for the "new era."[40]
On 5 December 2012, Smart Company named Nasser No. 6 on a list of the "most powerful people in Australian boardrooms."[1] At the time, Nasser ranked No. 18 on the Optimice Market Capitalisation Influence Index and at No. 17 on the MCII connectedness index.[1] He became a board member at 21st Century Fox in June 2013.[17] On 2 August 2015, it was confirmed that Nasser had joined the board of Koç Holding [2][17] a large Turkey-based conglomerate.[2] After the deadly Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil on 5 November 2015,[41] Nasser announced that BHP would be permitting an external investigation into the incident, with findings to be released publicly.[42]
In June 2017, BHP annonced that Nasser will be replaced by Ken MacKenzie as chairman effective on 1 September 2017.[43][44]
Honors and philanthropy[edit]
Nasser was named 'Automobile Industries Man of the Year' in 1999 by the Retail Motor Industry Organization.[7] In 2002[7] he was named an officer[4] of the National Order of the Cedar,[3] the highest honor in Lebanon.[4] Also that year Nasser[7] was awarded the Order of Australia and a Centenary Medal for "his contribution to Australian industry, as an Advisor to Government, and for education in the areas of technology."[3] The National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) awarded Nasser the Ellis Island Medal of Honor,[3] which pays homage to contributions made to America by immigrants.[5]
Nasser funds several scholarship programs[6] that assist individual students, including the Jacques Nasser Scholarship in Entrepreneurship at RMIT University in Melbourne, the Jacques Nasser Scholarship for MBA students at the American University of Beirut, and the Jacques Nasser Scholarship at the INSEAD School of Business.[3][third-party source needed] He also has been known to support organizations such as Focus: HOPE, a training center in Detroit.[3][third-party source needed]
Personal life[edit]
Nasser and his ex-wife Jennifer,[13] also an Australian,[7] married in 1970[13] and have four children together.[3][14] By 2009[38] Nasser was based primarily out of his home in Michigan,[1] though after becoming chairman of BHP Billiton[38] in 2010 he began spending equal time in Australia,[9] also having properties in New York City, London, and Melbourne. Described as a fan of racing,[13] Nasser has served as a periodic judge at Concours d'Elegance events.[45]
He has Australian-American dual citizenship, and is nicknamed "Jac".[11] He owns a 1961 Lincoln Continental. He has a sister named Betty.[46]

Jacques Nasser: Neues Spiel, neues Glück?

Jacques Nasser
Neues Spiel, neues Glück?





















Der geschasste Ex-Ford-Chef steht wieder in Lohn und Brot. Er stieg als Senior-Partner bei der US-Investmentfirma One Equity Partners ein. Die filetiert marode Unternehmen und sorgte kürzlich mit dem Kauf der für ihre U-Boote berühmten Kieler Werft HDW für Schlagzeilen.

Detroit - Jacques Nasser, der im Oktober 2001 nach nur
34 Monaten seinen Posten als Chef der Ford verloren hatte, ist Senior-Partner bei der amerikanischen Investmentfirma One Equity Partners LLC geworden.





AP
 
Globalen Erfahrungen: Jacques Nasser
 Dies gab One Equity am Montag bekannt. One Equity ist die private Investmentsparte der US-Großbank Bank One Corp.





One Equity hat in Deutschland eine 100-prozentige Beteiligung an der Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG erworben. Zunächst hatte sich die US-Investmentfirma mit 75 Prozent an HDW beteiligt. Sie hatte die HDW-Restanteile dann im Sommer dieses Jahres übernommen.





Nasser (54) war im vergangenen Jahr bei Ford gefeuert worden. Ford hatte im Jahr 2001 einen Riesenverlust von 5,45 Milliarden Dollar verbucht. Der Autokonzern hatte unter Nassers Regiment auf der einen Seite Volvo, Land Rover und andere Unternehmen aufgekauft - auf der anderen Seite mußte das Branchenschwergewicht Milliardenbeträge für den Rückruf von Firestone-Reifen ausgegeben. Nasser war nach nur 32 Monaten Amtszeit von Bill Ford Jr. abgelöst worden, dem Urenkel des Firmengründers Henry Ford.


Verwaltungsratchef bei Polaroid


Jetzt wird Nasser gleichzeitig Verwaltungsratsvorsitzender der Fotofirma Polaroid. Equity One hatte im Sommer die Vermögenswerte des vom Konkurs bedrohten Unternehmens für 255 Millionen Dollar übernommen. Das Unternehmen erhofft sich aufgrund des eingeführten Polaroid-Markennamens und neuer Produkte einen hohen Profit.





Investmentfirmen wie Equity One beteiligen sich an angeschlagenen Firmen oder übernehmen Unternehmen, um sie auf Vordermann zu bringen. Sie werden dann häufig einige Jahres später Gewinn bringend veräußert. Equity One hat Büros in Detroit, New York, Chicago und Frankfurt.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
