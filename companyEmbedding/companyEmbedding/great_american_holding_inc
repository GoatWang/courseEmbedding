About Us
Our History
Vision & Values Statement
Great American Ball Park





Great American Insurance Group is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance ("P&C"), focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses, and in the sale of traditional fixed and fixed-indexed annuities.

Property & Casualty Operations

The Property and Casualty Group is among the oldest in the United States, dating from the founding of our flagship company, Great American Insurance Company, in 1872. The P&C Group is made up of approximately 30 niche specialty insurance industries that focus on specialized commercial products and services for businesses.
Helping Businesses Focus on Business – Not Risk
Strong businesses play a crucial role in our communities. But their owners face more risks than ever. A lawsuit or a stroke of bad luck could set them back—or wipe them out completely—if they don’t have the right coverage. They count on knowledgeable insurance agents to help them manage the risks inherent in their industry, as well as their unique business circumstances.
Great American Insurance can help you provide innovative and affordable insurance solutions for your customers’ insurance needs. We’ve been insuring businesses—and strengthening great communities—for generations.
An Entrepreneurial Approach to Business
You’ll find that Great American is structured like a network of small businesses. All of our companies and divisions design products and build relationships in the markets and communities they serve. That means less red tape for you, and faster answers for your customers. You’ll always work directly with the experts in each specialty line, and get the personal attention you deserve.
Visit Specialty Property & Casualty to learn more. 
Annuity Operations
The Annuity Group provides consumers a broad range of financial resources, including traditional fixed and indexed annuities, sold in the education, financial institution, and retail markets.
