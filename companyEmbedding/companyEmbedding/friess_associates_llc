GREENVILLE, Del., June 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Friess Associates LLC today announced the launch of Friess Small Cap Growth Fund.  Friess Small Cap Growth Fund represents the first time Friess Associates makes its small-cap services widely available.  








Smaller companies played such a significant role in the early growth of Friess Associates that the firm began dedicating specialized attention to the small-cap category in 1982.  Over the next 35 years, only institutions and high-net-worth individuals able to meet substantial investment minimums could access the firm's small-cap services.
Friess Small Cap Growth Fund's investment minimum is $2,000 in the fund's investor class, which will trade under the ticker symbol SCGNX.  Led by Chief Investment Officer Scott Gates, Friess researchers cooperate to manage the portfolio as a team utilizing the firm's time-tested investment strategy.
"Friess Small Cap Growth Fund operates in a fruitful hunting ground for our earnings-driven investment approach," Scott said.  "Exhaustive research is at the core of our investment strategy, and we believe the small-cap category offers some of the best opportunities to find underappreciated companies through bottom-up legwork."
Friess Small Cap Growth Fund is designed to capitalize on the relationship between earnings performance and stock prices by holding companies experiencing above-average earnings growth that also show promise to exceed consensus earnings expectations.  While the fund's market-cap characteristics reflect its small-cap focus, the portfolio's sector weightings result from a true bottom-up, company-by-company approach and do not reflect the composition of any market index.  
"Friess Small Cap Growth Fund aims to beat benchmarks, not mimic them," Scott added.  
The fund's investment objective is to seek capital appreciation.  Institutional class shares of Friess Small Cap Growth Fund will trade under the ticker symbol SCGFX.
Founded in 1974, Friess Associates manages growth-equity portfolios that span the market-cap spectrum.  Every Friess-managed portfolio follows the same time-tested investment strategy emphasizing the relationship between each company's earnings performance and its share price.  Friess Associates manages separate portfolios for institutions and high-net-worth individuals.  The firm also serves as subadvisor to AMG Managers Brandywine Fund (BRWIX), AMG Managers Brandywine Blue Fund (BLUEX) and AMG Managers Brandywine Advisors Mid Cap Growth Fund (BWAFX).
Mutual fund investing involves risk.  Principal loss is possible.  Friess Small Cap Growth Fund invests in small-cap companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Fund may also invest in depositary receipts, which are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities because their values depend on the performance of the underlying foreign securities.
The funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing.  For this and other information related to Friess Small Cap Growth Fund, please call (855) 656-3017 or visit www.friessfunds.com for a free prospectus.  Prospectuses for the AMG Managers Brandywine Funds are available at (800) 835-3879 and www.amgfunds.com.  Read the appropriate prospectus carefully before investing. 
Friess Small Cap Growth Fund is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.  AMG Managers Brandywine Funds are distributed by AMG Distributors, Inc., a member of FINRA/SIPC.

Strategies

Investors enjoy countless options in terms of choosing the best path to reach their financial goals.  We consider growth to be the key ingredient to any successful long-term investment plan. Growth equity investing has been our hallmark since our founding.
Growth strategy at a glance

Rapidly growing companies
Reasonable valuations
Focus on companies likely to exceed earnings estimates
Emphasis on lesser-known companies rather than industry leaders


All Cap Growth

All Cap Growth
Portfolios that capture the full reach of our research effort.  Covering the entire market-cap spectrum, the All Cap portfolios we manage nimbly shift to emerging pockets of earnings strength as the environment evolves.  The Friess All Cap Composite was created on December 31, 1977 to measure the collective performance of the All Cap portfolios we manage.
Small Cap Growth

Small Cap Growth
The Small Cap category is one of our most fruitful hunting grounds since the core of our investment strategy is developing an information edge through exhaustive research legwork. In general, smaller companies are not as widely followed as companies higher up the market-cap ladder. That means gathering grassroots insights about trends in a company’s operational “food chain” can be especially valuable in terms of assessing a stock’s potential. The Friess Small Cap Composite was launched on December 31, 1981.
Mid Cap Growth

Mid Cap Growth
Mid-sized companies are among our most frequent targets given our earnings-growth requirements. Mid Cap companies play a significant role in the All Cap portfolios we manage. We began offering Mid Cap-only options in response to advisors and investors with more defined market-cap parameters. Friess Associates began managing its first Mid Cap portfolio on October 31, 2000.
Large Cap Growth

Large Cap Growth
Portfolios that take an unique approach to large company investing. The portfolios reflect a focus on uncovering companies that capture market share rather than industry leaders that must fend off competition. The portfolios regularly hold well-known companies as well. The Large Cap portfolios we manage tend to show lower correlations versus large cap benchmarks due to our bottom-up investment approach. Friess Associates launched its first Large Cap portfolio on January 10, 1991.
Concentrated Growth

Concentrated Growth
Friess Associates began managing its first concentrated portfolio on December 31, 1996 as a subadvisory mandate. Our separately managed concentrated offerings grew out of that experience. While limiting the number of holdings in a portfolio affects its risk-reward profile, our concentrated portfolios consist of high-conviction investment ideas.

Portfolio Construction




































 
Friess Associates Home | Contact Us


Portfolio Construction
Portfolios positioned to beat the benchmarks, not mimic them
Friess Associates is an active, bottom-up manager. We build portfolios one company at a time without regard to the composition of any particular index. Our individual-company focus results in portfolios that typically offer lower correlations to passive benchmarks.

The Friess Associates investment strategy is based on each company’s ability to influence its share price through operational performance. Our portfolio management style is consistent with that individual-company focus. The goal is to outperform the indexes, not mimic them.
Collections of our best ideas
Existing holdings must continuously earn their keep by showing more upside potential than new candidates for purchase based on their respective fundamental outlooks. We follow a forced displacement discipline that leads us to continue to upgrade the portfolio with new opportunities that investors have yet to fully reward. The goal is to replace good investments with great ones, resulting in a portfolio that represents a collection of our best ideas.

Philosophy Overview




































 
Friess Associates Home | Contact Us


Philosophy Overview

Individual-company fundamentals determine stock prices
While interest rates, geopolitical events and other macro forces can move “the market” for fleeting periods, each company influences the long-term direction of its share price through operational execution.
Companies that top expectations attract positive attention
As growth investors, we view earnings growth as the ultimate sign of a company’s success. We believe companies with earnings power that the broader investment community underestimates offer the best potential for share price appreciation.

Exhaustive research legwork isolates companies with the most potential to positively surprise
We believe the best way to gain insight into individual-company earnings trends is to stay connected to the front lines of the economy through ongoing interviews with management teams, customers, competitors and suppliers. Exhaustive research is our firm’s central focus.
Each company earns its space in the portfolio by showing greater promise than an existing holding
Consistent with our individual-company focus, a portfolio position is prime space only available to a company with a better fundamental profile than an existing holding. Portfolio construction is a function of our continuous search for individual-company earnings strength.
Valuation sensitivity is critical to investment success
High valuations invite risk. To maximize upside potential and mitigate downside risk, we focus on rapidly growing companies that also sell at reasonable share prices relative to earnings.

Bottom-Up Research




































 
Friess Associates Home | Contact Us


Bottom-Up Research
Exhaustive, company-by-company research is the Friess advantage
We dedicate our resources to conducting research legwork, which entails regular interaction with people on the front lines of the economy. Friess Associates coined the term “trade check” to describe the interviews we conduct with company executives, managers, customers, competitors and suppliers. Trade checks include in-person company visits, trade shows, user conferences and discussions via phone.

The Friess research team conducts hundreds of trade checks each month in its ongoing effort to glean insights on existing and potential holdings. Trade checks represent one of our most fruitful methods of idea generation, with research legwork often uncovering promising opportunities outside of the initial direction of our investigation.
