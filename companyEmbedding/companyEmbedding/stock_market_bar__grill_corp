A stock fund or ETF with a higher beta than the S&P 500 will rise or fall to a greater degree. In contrast, a stock fund or ETF with a low beta will rise or fall less.

3 Big Stock Charts for Wednesday: Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG), Intel Corporation (INTC) and Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe earnings season continues to feed the market with fuel, allowing the broader indices to inch higher on a daily basis. While the results have been positive, there are still a few companies that our analysis is telling us to be weary of as they're falling into the "have not" category.Today's three big stock charts look at Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ), Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG ) as three companies that the earnings season is not providing any help for as their charts continue to warn of lower prices.Intel Corporation (INTC)For more than a year we've watched Intel struggle in a changing environment for semiconductor stocks. On a year-to-date basis, INTC shares have lost almost 3% compared to the semiconductor sector's gains of almost 20%, putting it in the bottom decile in terms of performance. The company is set to announce earnings results on Thursday after the close, but the charts aren't showing much hope for a rally.The recent jump in Intel shares represents a "buy the rumor" rally as earnings approach. This signals that the market may be getting ahead of itself by pricing excessive earnings results into INTC's price. Any failure to impress with results will lead to a "sell the news" correction.The rally has brought Intel shares to their respective 50-day moving average. This trendline has been relatively staunch resistance for the stock as traders have been trading off of the clearly bearish trend.Volume on INTC stock is on the decline as earnings approach, indicating that the market's interest in Intel is waning as companies like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) are the clear market and sector leaders.Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM)Another technology company that continues to struggle with the chart and technical traders is Qualcomm. The company operates in some of the same circles as INTC and it is feeling the same pressures.10 Dogs of 2017 That Will Become 2018's Best Stocks to BuyQCOM shares are down more than 18% YTD and they continue to see pressure from the technicals after their earnings report last week.Overhead, the 50-day moving average is combining with the 100-day trendline at $56.50 - the same level that rejected Qualcomm stock last week.Both the 50- and 200-day moving averages are trending lower, indicating that the intermediate-term outlook remains bearish for QCOM.From a long-term perspective, Qualcomm has broken back into a long-term bear market trend. This indicated a target of $43 for the stock over the long run.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG)After another Norovirus outbreak and other negative headlines, Chipotle shares are breaking lower, despite another positive earnings report.Is Twitter, Inc. (TWTR) Stock Ready for a Big Comeback?The company estimated that it has seen a 7% decline in revenue over the last week as a result of the headline scares, but the techncials appear to indicate that CMG stock has yet to see a bottom.After trading above their 20-month moving average, putting it in a bull market, Chipotle shares have broken back below this critical trendline and returned to a bear market. This will increase pressure on CMG stock.Shares of Chipotle had already broken into an intermediate-term bearish trend in mid-June as the stock's 50-day moving average rolled over and started trending lower. This indicates that the technical traders are increasing their selling of the shares on any rally.CMG stock has now broken below the October 2016 lows - the point where most investors thought that the worst had been priced into the stock. This critical chart support giving way opens the sellers to take Chipotle down to the $275 target.As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace10 Stocks That Will Rocket Higher on Short Squeeze Power7 Recent IPO Stocks to Sell While You Still Can7 Stocks With Huge Spinoff PotentialThe post 3 Big Stock Charts for Wednesday: Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

Let the market decide, says a new restaurant in Manhattan where prices for food and beverages will fluctuate like stock prices in increments according to demand.  The Exchange Bar & Grill, set amid the bustling shops and pubs of the Grammercy Park neighborhood, is replete with a ticker tape flashing menu prices in red lettering as demand forces them to fluctuate.  Customers can move prices for all beverages and bar snacks such as hot wings ($7 for 6 pieces) or fried calamari ($9). The prices will fluctuate in $.25 cent increments, but will most likely plateau at a $2 change in either direction.  A glass of Guinness starts at $6 but could be pushed to a high of $8 or a low of $4, depending on popularity.  So if one drink is in heavy demand, its price will rise, causing the cost of other equivalent drinks to drop. A rush on a particular beer would increase its price, and cause other beers to drop.  Owners Levent Cakar and Damon Bae admit the stock exchange theme is a gimmick but hope a good deal on drinks and their hamburger's tastiness will win over customers.  "Its definitely something a little bit different," said Bae. "There is a little bit of a twist."  <p>A ticker showing current prices of drinks runs behind the bar of The Exchange Bar &amp; Grill in New York March 24, 2010.Lucas Jackson</p>Bae, 35, who has an MBA from Georgetown University and Cakar, a veteran restaurant hand, combined forces to open the airy lounge, which serves up to 60 people.  The Exchange Bar & Grill has a long bar facing the ticker tape -- and flat screen televisions -- as well as a few tables in the back where patrons can eat in greater comfort.  Restaurants in New York and across America have had a tough year because consumers have slashed discretionary spending in a tough economic climate. New York has about 23,000 restaurants, with about 4,400 opening each year according to the city's Department of Health, which tracks establishment licenses.  Slideshow (3 Images)The number of sit-down restaurants in New York dropped 9 percent from the fall of 2008 to 2009, according to market research firm NPD Group.  Good prices and a good location should be enough to make their project work, Bae said. And, Cakar added, put in a dash of speculation and you've got a winning recipe.  "Why couldn't we play with the prices like a stock market?" said Cakar, who explained that when he mentioned the bar's concept to his liquor distributors, they laughed at him.  "One day you are all going to come to me to put your drinks on my ticker tape," he told them.  The restaurant opens April 1.

Going OutRestaurants Stock Exchange theme bar with fluctuating drinks prices is coming to the City 

The more popular a drink is, the more expensive it will be at this new bar in London's financial district, says Ben Norum

              A numbers game: stock market ticker in Canary Wharf            




A bar themed on the stock exchange will open in the City next week, selling drinks at prices that change in line with their popularity that evening.Owner Alan Grant explained that the concept is supposed to be “all about having fun”, but that the technology behind it is quite serious. “We’ve worked with companies in Berlin and Mumbai to develop a pricing algorithm that is the closest thing you’ll find to real-time markets,” he said. “Effectively, if someone buys three beers then the price of that beer will rise and the price of others will decrease. The more popular a drink is, the more expensive it will be – it’s market economics.”Reserve Bar Stock Exchange opens on Gresham Street next Thursday (June 18) spread across three floors, and will run from 5pm-2am every Monday to Thursday and until 3am on Fridays and Saturdays.It will operate a ‘beer market’, a ‘spirits market’ and an ‘alternative market’, with big screens and a ticker showing the current prices of drinks. There will also be an app which allows at-table ordering, ensuring the price hasn’t changed by the time you get served.Street kitchen: Bloom Kitchen will provide foodLike in real stock exchange offices in times gone by, bells will be rung and sirens sounded to signal a crash, but in this case it’s a good thing – it means cheap drinks.“Buying the right things at the right time will mean you can get drinks for as little as half the price they’d usually sell for,” says Grant. “There will be some very good deals to be had, and this is the only place in London where you can – almost – control the prices.”As well as covering all the usual bases, the bar will serve its own-branded Reserve Brew beer (rather sexistly labelled Real Man’s Brew) which has been made for it by big brewer Molson Coors. It will be available in three-pint growlers – sometimes for as little as £6 a go.There will also be a changing range of house cocktails, including the Black Tuesday – a twist on a mojito made with raspberries, mint, chambord and bourbon.Read more...The 50 best bars in LondonSoho House to launch two egg-themed restaurants in LondonKettner's restaurant to be restored in Soho House plan for hotelA rotating selection of street food residencies will provide food, starting with Bloom Kitchen which offers flatbreads topped with pulled beef brisket and other meats.While the bar is the first of its kind in London, Exchange Bar & Grill in New York and Bar Dow Jones in Barcelona both work in a similar way.Follow Ben Norum on Twitter @BenNorumFollow Going Out on Facebook and on Twitter @ESgoingout

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
