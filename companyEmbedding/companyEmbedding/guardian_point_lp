6’ Leash$33.00

Keeping important training and operational gear in order is essential. Having this in mind we designed our Handler Kit Bags using a modular concept. Our bags are made of Cardura Nylon and also include Flat Mesh sections for breathability. The modular design allows functionality, organization and ample storage space. The bottom of each bag is improved using Reinforced 1750 Travelers Denier Cardura, which provides durability and extends the life of the bag. Heavy-duty one-piece Mil-Spec 1 ¾ inch Nylon Webbing is used for the handles, which fully encompass the circumference of the bag. HAND MADE in the USA.

Gauntlets$135.00

Conducting multiple bite sessions wearing a suit can be strenuous on a decoy. Added support can save your helper but still allow for realistic training. Our Gauntlets are made using strong Cardura fabric that is lined with a layer of Nufoam Densified Polyester Padding sewn into the sleeves for added protection. Adjustable straps are included on the sleeves and between the shoulder blades to accommodate adjustability for different sizes.
