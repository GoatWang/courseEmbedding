Catchmark Timber Trust :: Home






















Skip to navigation
Skip to content









 










 






 



CatchMark (NYSE: CTT) is a public company that strives to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns for all stakeholders through disciplined acquisitions, sustainable harvests, and well-timed sales. 





Strategy
Our objective is to maximize total returns for our shareholders by providing ongoing dividends derived from sustainable harvesting from our existing portfolios of high-quality U.S. timberlands.  We also intend to selectively pursue timberland acquisition opportunities with focused efforts in the most commercially desirable timber-producing regions of the U.S. South and U.S. Pacific Northwest, although we may also pursue opportunistic acquisitions outside of these regions. The current housing market recovery and supply disruptions in Canadian timber markets bode well for increasing demand for our timber products from domestic as well as offshore users over the long-term. We do not engage in timber-related manufacturing operations, which allows us to focus on optimal management of our timberlands and prevents us from being exposed to the risks inherent in direct ownership of timber-related manufacturing operations. More




Property Highlights
CatchMark manages approximately 496,800 acres of high-quality commercial timberland located in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The portfolio is well diversified by species and product mix (74% pine/26% hardwood by acreage and 49% sawtimber/51% pulpwood by volume).  Our timberlands are located in proximity to a variety of established wood products, pulp, and paper manufacturing facilities, which provide a steady source of competitive demand for both pulpwood and higher-value sawtimber products.  More
All data as of 03/31/2017.




Sustainability
Conscientious forest management serves investors by preserving the integrity of the land and forest habitats, which enhances the market value of timberland assets while promoting a healthier environment. CatchMark is committed to sustainable forest practices across our entire portfolio and we are proud that since 2008 our timberlands have been certified by the Sustainable Forestry Initiative®. More
