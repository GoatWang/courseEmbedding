Our services are organized into
 three boxes.
You won’t fit neatly
 into any of them.





Come to Aspiriant if you want true customization and personalization, drawing on an immense range of services. The specific blend is dictated 100-percent by you.
Every client gets institutional-grade investment management, masterminded by our deep in-house research team. From there, we add some of the most meticulous and invigorating financial planning you can find, performed by your own dedicated team of caring specialists. There’s much more, if and when you need it: tax management, estate planning, philanthropy. The list goes on and on.
Our services fall into three broad categories:
Investing
 Investing & Wealth Planning
 Family Office
It’s likely you’ll use something from each of these. The situation is fluid. What we do for you evolves as you and your life evolve. But the underlying structure and support you receive remain constant. That’s real wealth management.

        May 11, 2017.
        
          AGENCY:
Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”).
ACTION:
Notice.
Notice of an application for an order under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Act”) for an exemption from sections 12(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C) of the Act; under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Act; and under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption from rule 12d1-2(a) under the Act. The requested order would: (a) Permit certain registered open-end investment companies to acquire shares of certain registered open-end investment companies, registered closed-end investment companies, business development companies, as defined in section 2(a)(48) of the Act, and unit investment trusts (collectively, “Underlying Funds”) that are within and outside the same group of investment companies as the acquiring investment companies, in excess of the limits in section 12(d)(1) of the Act; and (b) permit certain registered open-end management investment companies relying on rule 12d1-2 under the Act to invest in certain financial instruments.

Applicants: Aspiriant Trust, a Delaware statutory trust that is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company with multiple series; Aspiriant, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and UMB Distribution Services, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company that is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Filing Dates: The application was filed on May 20, 2015, and amended on September 3, 2015, March 16, 2016, September 26, 2016, September 27, 2016, and March 13, 2017.

Hearing or Notification of Hearing: An order granting the requested relief will be issued unless the Commission orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a hearing by writing to the Commission's Secretary and serving applicants with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing requests should be received by the Commission Start Printed Page 22690by 5:30 p.m. on June 5, 2017 and should be accompanied by proof of service on the applicants, in the form of an affidavit, or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Pursuant to rule 0-5 under the Act, hearing requests should state the nature of the writer's interest, any facts bearing upon the desirability of a hearing on the matter, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons who wish to be notified of a hearing may request notification by writing to the Commission's Secretary.

Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE., Washington, DC 20549-1090. Applicants: Benjamin D. Schmidt, Aspiriant, LLC, 1111 East Kilbourn Avenue, Suite 1700, Milwaukee, WI 53202.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm, or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Summary of the Application
1. Applicants request an order to permit (a) each Fund [1] 
           (each a “Fund of Funds”) to acquire shares of Underlying Funds [2] 
           in excess of the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act and (b) each Underlying Fund, any principal underwriter for the Underlying Fund, and any broker or dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to sell shares of the Underlying Fund to a Fund of Funds, in excess of the limits in section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act.[3] 
           Applicants also request an order of exemption under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act from the prohibition on certain affiliated transactions in section 17(a) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Underlying Funds to sell their shares to, and redeem their shares from, the Funds of Funds.[4] 
           Applicants state that such transactions will be consistent with the policies of each Fund of Funds and each Underlying Fund and with the general purposes of the Act and will be based on the net asset values of the Underlying Funds.
2. Applicants further request an exemption under section 6(c) from rule 12d1-2 under the Act to permit any Fund that relies on section 12(d)(1)(G) of the Act (“Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund”) and that otherwise complies with rule 12d1-2 under the Act, to also invest, to the extent consistent with its investment objective, policies, strategies and limitations, in financial instruments that may not be securities within the meaning of section 2(a)(36) of the Act (“Other Investments”).
3. Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the application. Such terms and conditions are designed to, among other things, help prevent any potential (i) undue influence over an Underlying Fund that is not in the same “group of investment companies” as the Fund of Funds through control or voting power, or in connection with certain services, transactions, and underwritings, (ii) excessive layering of fees, and (iii) overly complex fund structures, which are the concerns underlying the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C) of the Act. Applicants assert that permitting a Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund to invest in Other Investments as described in the application would not raise any of the concerns that section 12(d)(1) of the Act was intended to address.
3. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any persons or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

1.
     Applicants request that the order apply to each existing and future series of Aspiriant Trust and to each existing and future registered open-end investment company or series thereof that is advised by Aspiriant, LLC or its successor or by any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with Aspiriant, LLC or its successor and is part of the same “group of investment companies” as Aspiriant Trust (each, a “Fund”). Applicants further request that the order also apply to any future principal underwriter and distributor for a Fund. For purposes of the requested order, “successor” is limited to an entity that results from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization. For purposes of the request for relief, the term “group of investment companies” means any two or more registered investment companies, including closed-end investment companies, and business development companies, that hold themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of investment and investor services.

        Back to Citation
      


2.
     Certain of the Underlying Funds have obtained exemptions from the Commission necessary to permit their shares to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange at negotiated prices and, accordingly, to operate as an exchange-traded fund (“ETF”).

        Back to Citation
      


3.
     Applicants are not requesting relief for a Fund of Funds to invest in business development companies and registered closed-end investment companies that are not listed on a national securities exchange.

        Back to Citation
      


4.
     Applicants note that a Fund of Funds generally would purchase and sell shares of an Underlying Fund that operates as an ETF, closed-end fund, or business development company through secondary market transactions rather than through principal transactions with the Underlying Fund. Applicants nevertheless request relief from sections 17(a)(1) and (2) to permit each Fund of Funds that is an affiliated person, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of an ETF, closed-end fund, or business development company to purchase or redeem shares from the ETF or to acquire shares from the closed-end fund or business development company in connection with an underwritten initial or follow-on offering made by such closed-end fund or business development company as described in the application.

alternative trading systems that have
been exempted from compliance with
the statutory standards applicable to
exchanges. Because competitors are free
to modify their own fees and credits in
response, and because market
participants may readily adjust their
order routing practices, the Exchange
believes that the degree to which fee
changes in this market may impose any
burden on competition is extremely
limited. As a result of all of these
considerations, the Exchange does not
believe that the proposed changes will
impair the ability of ETP Holders or
competing order execution venues to
maintain their competitive standing in
the financial markets.
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Comments on the
Proposed Rule Change Received From
Members, Participants, or Others
No written comments were solicited
or received with respect to the proposed
rule change.
III. Date of Effectiveness of the
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for
Commission Action
The foregoing rule change is effective
upon filing pursuant to Section
19(b)(3)(A) 11 of the Act and
subparagraph (f)(2) of Rule 19b–4 12
thereunder, because it establishes a due,
fee, or other charge imposed by the
Exchange.
At any time within 60 days of the
filing of such proposed rule change, the
Commission summarily may
temporarily suspend such rule change if
it appears to the Commission that such
action is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest, for the protection of
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of
the purposes of the Act. If the
Commission takes such action, the
Commission shall institute proceedings
under Section 19(b)(2)(B) 13 of the Act to
determine whether the proposed rule
change should be approved or
disapproved.

Aspiriant, LLC, 1111 East Kilbourn
Avenue, Suite 1700, Milwaukee, WI
53202.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

Kieran G. Brown, Senior Counsel, at
(202) 551–6773, or David Marcinkus,
Branch Chief, at (202) 551–6821
(Division of Investment Management,
Chief Counsel’s Office).
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The
following is a summary of the

www.sec.gov/search/search.htm, or by

Summary of the Application
1. Applicants request an order to
permit (a) each Fund 1 (each a ‘‘Fund of
Funds’’) to acquire shares of Underlying
Funds 2 in excess of the limits in
sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act
and (b) each Underlying Fund, any
principal underwriter for the

nlaroche on DSK30NT082PROD with NOTICES

1 Applicants

request that the order apply to each
existing and future series of Aspiriant Trust and to
each existing and future registered open-end
investment company or series thereof that is
advised by Aspiriant, LLC or its successor or by any
entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with Aspiriant, LLC or its successor and is
part of the same ‘‘group of investment companies’’
as Aspiriant Trust (each, a ‘‘Fund’’). Applicants
further request that the order also apply to any
future principal underwriter and distributor for a
Fund. For purposes of the requested order,
‘‘successor’’ is limited to an entity that results from
a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a
change in the type of business organization. For
purposes of the request for relief, the term ‘‘group
of investment companies’’ means any two or more
registered investment companies, including closedend investment companies, and business
development companies, that hold themselves out
to investors as related companies for purposes of
investment and investor services.
2 Certain of the Underlying Funds have obtained
exemptions from the Commission necessary to
permit their shares to be listed and traded on a
national securities exchange at negotiated prices
and, accordingly, to operate as an exchange-traded
fund (‘‘ETF’’).

Underlying Fund, and any broker or
dealer registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 to sell shares of
the Underlying Fund to a Fund of
Funds, in excess of the limits in section
12(d)(1)(B) of the Act.3 Applicants also
request an order of exemption under
sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act from
the prohibition on certain affiliated
transactions in section 17(a) of the Act
to the extent necessary to permit the
Underlying Funds to sell their shares to,
and redeem their shares from, the Funds
of Funds.4 Applicants state that such
transactions will be consistent with the
policies of each Fund of Funds and each
Underlying Fund and with the general
purposes of the Act and will be based
on the net asset values of the
Underlying Funds.
2. Applicants further request an
exemption under section 6(c) from rule
12d1–2 under the Act to permit any
Fund that relies on section 12(d)(1)(G)
of the Act (‘‘Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund’’)
and that otherwise complies with rule
12d1–2 under the Act, to also invest, to
the extent consistent with its investment
objective, policies, strategies and
limitations, in financial instruments that
may not be securities within the
meaning of section 2(a)(36) of the Act
(‘‘Other Investments’’).
3. Applicants agree that any order
granting the requested relief will be
subject to the terms and conditions
stated in the application. Such terms
and conditions are designed to, among
other things, help prevent any potential
(i) undue influence over an Underlying
Fund that is not in the same ‘‘group of
investment companies’’ as the Fund of
Funds through control or voting power,
or in connection with certain services,
transactions, and underwritings, (ii)
excessive layering of fees, and (iii)
overly complex fund structures, which
are the concerns underlying the limits
in sections 12(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C) of
3 Applicants are not requesting relief for a Fund
of Funds to invest in business development
companies and registered closed-end investment
companies that are not listed on a national
securities exchange.
4 Applicants note that a Fund of Funds generally
would purchase and sell shares of an Underlying
Fund that operates as an ETF, closed-end fund, or
business development company through secondary
market transactions rather than through principal
transactions with the Underlying Fund. Applicants
nevertheless request relief from sections 17(a)(1)
and (2) to permit each Fund of Funds that is an
affiliated person, or an affiliated person of an
affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the
Act, of an ETF, closed-end fund, or business
development company to purchase or redeem
shares from the ETF or to acquire shares from the
closed-end fund or business development company
in connection with an underwritten initial or
follow-on offering made by such closed-end fund or
business development company as described in the
application.

the Act. Applicants assert that
permitting a Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund to
invest in Other Investments as described
in the application would not raise any
of the concerns that section 12(d)(1) of
the Act was intended to address.
3. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act
provides that the Commission may
exempt any person, security, or
transaction, or any class or classes of
persons, securities, or transactions, from
any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the
exemption is consistent with the public
interest and the protection of investors.
Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the
Commission to grant an order
permitting a transaction otherwise
prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds
that (a) the terms of the proposed
transaction are fair and reasonable and
do not involve overreaching on the part
of any person concerned; (b) the
proposed transaction is consistent with
the policies of each registered
investment company involved; and (c)
the proposed transaction is consistent
with the general purposes of the Act.
Section 6(c) of the Act permits the
Commission to exempt any persons or
transactions from any provision of the
Act if such exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest and
consistent with the protection of
investors and the purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of
the Act.
For the Commission, by the Division of
Investment Management, pursuant to
delegated authority.

application. The complete application may be obtained via the 
Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an 
applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm, or by calling (202) 551-8090.

Summary of the Application

    1. Applicants request an order to permit (a) each Fund \1\ (each a 
``Fund of Funds'') to acquire shares of Underlying Funds \2\ in excess 
of the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act and (b) each 
Underlying Fund, any principal underwriter for the Underlying Fund, and 
any broker or dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 to sell shares of the Underlying Fund to a Fund of Funds, in 
excess of the limits in section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act.\3\ Applicants 
also request an order of exemption under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the 
Act from the prohibition on certain affiliated transactions in section 
17(a) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Underlying Funds 
to sell their shares to, and redeem their shares from, the Funds of 
Funds.\4\ Applicants state that such transactions will be consistent 
with the policies of each Fund of Funds and each Underlying Fund and 
with the general purposes of the Act and will be based on the net asset 
values of the Underlying Funds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Applicants request that the order apply to each existing and 
future series of Aspiriant Trust and to each existing and future 
registered open-end investment company or series thereof that is 
advised by Aspiriant, LLC or its successor or by any entity 
controlling, controlled by or under common control with Aspiriant, 
LLC or its successor and is part of the same ``group of investment 
companies'' as Aspiriant Trust (each, a ``Fund''). Applicants 
further request that the order also apply to any future principal 
underwriter and distributor for a Fund. For purposes of the 
requested order, ``successor'' is limited to an entity that results 
from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the 
type of business organization. For purposes of the request for 
relief, the term ``group of investment companies'' means any two or 
more registered investment companies, including closed-end 
investment companies, and business development companies, that hold 
themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of 
investment and investor services.
    \2\ Certain of the Underlying Funds have obtained exemptions 
from the Commission necessary to permit their shares to be listed 
and traded on a national securities exchange at negotiated prices 
and, accordingly, to operate as an exchange-traded fund (``ETF'').
    \3\ Applicants are not requesting relief for a Fund of Funds to 
invest in business development companies and registered closed-end 
investment companies that are not listed on a national securities 
exchange.
    \4\ Applicants note that a Fund of Funds generally would 
purchase and sell shares of an Underlying Fund that operates as an 
ETF, closed-end fund, or business development company through 
secondary market transactions rather than through principal 
transactions with the Underlying Fund. Applicants nevertheless 
request relief from sections 17(a)(1) and (2) to permit each Fund of 
Funds that is an affiliated person, or an affiliated person of an 
affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of an 
ETF, closed-end fund, or business development company to purchase or 
redeem shares from the ETF or to acquire shares from the closed-end 
fund or business development company in connection with an 
underwritten initial or follow-on offering made by such closed-end 
fund or business development company as described in the 
application.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. Applicants further request an exemption under section 6(c) from 
rule 12d1-2 under the Act to permit any Fund that relies on section 
12(d)(1)(G) of the Act (``Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund'') and that 
otherwise complies with rule 12d1-2 under the Act, to also invest, to 
the extent consistent with its investment objective, policies, 
strategies and limitations, in financial instruments that may not be 
securities within the meaning of section 2(a)(36) of the Act (``Other 
Investments'').
    3. Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief 
will be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the application. 
Such terms and conditions are designed to, among other things, help 
prevent any potential (i) undue influence over an Underlying Fund that 
is not in the same ``group of investment companies'' as the Fund of 
Funds through control or voting power, or in connection with certain 
services, transactions, and underwritings, (ii) excessive layering of 
fees, and (iii) overly complex fund structures, which are the concerns 
underlying the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C) of the Act. 
Applicants assert that permitting a Section 12(d)(1)(G) Fund to invest 
in Other Investments as described in the application would not raise 
any of the concerns that section 12(d)(1) of the Act was intended to 
address.
    3. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may 
exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of 
persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision of section 
12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and 
the protection of investors. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the 
Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise 
prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) the terms of the 
proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve 
overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed 
transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered 
investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is 
consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the 
Act permits the Commission to exempt any persons or transactions from 
any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate 
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors 
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 
Act.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
pursuant to delegated authority.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household
