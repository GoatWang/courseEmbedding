Corporate Policies
WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY
Procedures for the Submission of Complaints Regarding Financial Statement or other Disclosures, Accounting, Internal Accounting or Disclosure Controls, Auditing Matters or Violations of the First Trinity Financial Corporation Code of Conduct
Overview:
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our Audit Committee to establish procedures for: (a) the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters; and (b) the submission by employees of the Company and others, on a confidential and anonymous basis, of good faith concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. Accordingly, First Trinity Financial Corporation will promptly forward to the Audit Committee any complaints that it has received, whether from an employee or a third party, regarding any of these matters, subject to and consistent with this detailed Policy.
Employee Procedures:
Any employee or agent(associate) of the Company may submit, on a confidential, anonymous basis if the associate so desires, any good faith concerns regarding financial statement or other disclosure, accounting, internal accounting or disclosure controls, auditing matters or violations of the Company’s Code of Conduct. Associates are encouraged to assist in eliminating any Code of Conduct violations by bringing concerns to their designated Ethics Point of Contact but if, for any reason, an associate wishes to remain anonymous while filing a complaint, a toll free telephone number is provided by the Company. Associates must be able to file a complaint in confidence. So for instance, First Trinity Financial Corporation assures its associates that it cannot track caller i.d. for this number. Sufficient information should be provided to allow initiation of an investigation. The toll-free telephone number is known as The Associate Assistance Line, and it is 1-888-883-1499. Associates may also use the toll free number to report complaints regarding accounting, auditing, internal controls, securities fraud and our corporate disclosure policies. Any complaints submitted through the toll free number relating to any of these matters will be presented by the Chief legal officer to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Alternatively, any such concerns may be forwarded in writing to the chairman of the Audit Committee, in care of the Company’s Chief legal officer, in an envelope labeled with a legend such as: “Submitted pursuant to the whistleblower policy.” In the event a member of management other than the Chief legal officer receives an accounting or fraud complaint, he or she must forward it to the Chief legal officer.
Third Parties:
Outside parties, including shareholders, who wish to bring issues regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters to the attention of the Audit Committee may also either (a) call the Associate Assistance Line or (b) write to the chairman of the Audit Committee, in care of the Company’s Chief legal officer, in an envelope labeled with a legend such as: “Submitted pursuant to the whistleblower policy.” Again, sufficient information should be provided to allow initiation of an investigation. Also, in the event a member of management other than the Chief legal officer receives an accounting or fraud complaint, he or she must forward it to the Chief legal officer.
Investigations:
The Company’s Chief legal officer shall regularly provide a summary of any such complaints to the Audit Committee, and it is the policy of the Committee that one or more of its members shall from time to time examine the originals of all such complaints received by the Company. The Chief legal officer has the responsibility to ensure that the complaints which are not required to be reported to the Audit Committee pursuant to this policy or pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act shall be handled in the regular and appropriate fashion and shall not be referred to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee will consider each matter reported to it and, as appropriate, investigate the complaint and take any necessary and appropriate corrective and disciplinary actions The Audit Committee Chairperson will determine who should lead the investigation, and whether to use an independent third party or an associate of First Trinity Financial Corporation. Investigators may include, but are not limited to, the Chief legal officer, Director –Internal Audit, VP-Human Resources, external auditors or external legal counsel. If a third party investigator is chosen, the Company will provide the Audit Committee with funding to compensate the third party investigator. The Audit Committee Chairperson will seek to assure that the investigator is fully independent. The investigator will prepare a report of findings and recommendations based on the results of the investigation. Copies of the report will be provided to the Audit Committee and the Chief legal officer. If the findings indicate the complaint has validity, the Audit Committee will determine the action required, which could include disciplining the responsible person(s), and/or establishing new processes to prevent further violations. The Audit Committee Chairperson will discuss the findings with the Chief legal officer to determine whether public disclosure or disclosure to outside agencies and/or reporting to the full Board of Directors, is necessary or appropriate. In conducting any investigation, the Audit Committee shall use all appropriate efforts to protect the confidentiality and anonymity of any associate who has filed a complaint. The Company does not permit retaliation of any kind against its associates for complaints submitted hereunder that are made in good faith. Additionally, no employee shall be adversely affected because the employee refuses to carry out a directive that, in fact, constitutes corporate fraud, or is a violation of state or federal law or the Company’s Code of Conduct. The Audit Committee shall retain as a part of the records of the Audit Committee any such complaints or concerns, and the reports of any investigation, for a period of no less than three (3) years.

TULSA, Okla., April 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Tulsa based First Trinity Financial Corp, along with its subsidiaries, Trinity Life Insurance Company and Family Benefit Life Insurance Company, saw a significant increase in growth, expansion and profits in 2014. 
Consolidated Revenues and Net Income
Net Income more than doubled in 2014, with a 116.5 percent increase from $889,323 in 2013 to $1.9 million in 2014. Net income in 2014 was First Trinity Financial's highest earnings year-to-date excluding the 2011 net income which included a net gain of $6.9 million from the acquisition of Family Benefit Life Insurance Company.
Revenues for 2014 reached an all-time high for the company. First Trinity Financial reported consolidated revenue of $17.8 million, up more than 10.7 percent over 2013. Revenue was driven by life insurance premiums, investment income and realized gains on investments. 
"First Trinity had a great year in 2014," Gregg Zahn, CEO of First Trinity Financial said. "Our strength and sustainability shows in our numbers."
Assets
First Trinity Financial's combined assets grew 19.6 percent, from $183 million to $219 million an increase of $35 million. This growth in assets was primarily attributed to the organic growth of its life companies. First Trinity Financial's asset growth has exceeded all projections to date.        
"First Trinity has grown substantially over the past couple years and 2014 was no different," said Zahn. "We have great momentum heading into 2015."
Investments
Over the past several years, First Trinity Financial has seen steady growth in both net investment income and realized investment gains. In 2014, net investment income and net realized gains increased to $9.7 million from $8.1 million in 2013, resulting in an 18.9% increase.
"We've seen an increase in our net investment income and net realized gains due to several factors including the exponential increase in invested assets over the past several years and the decision to diversify our investment portfolio," Zahn said. 
Statutory Life and Annuity Premiums
The combined statutory premiums and annuity considerations from First Trinity Financial's life insurance operations grew 31 percent from $29.4 million in 2013 to $38.6 million in 2014, an increase of $9.2 million. This increase was a direct result of the organic growth of First Trinity Financial's life insurance subsidiaries, Trinity Life Insurance Company and Family Benefit Life Insurance Company.
States of Operations
Trinity Life Insurance Company and Family Benefit Life Insurance Company are now licensed in 24 states. In 2014, Family Benefit Life Insurance Company was approved to conduct business in Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and pending approval in Alabama. This more than exceeds Zahn's expectations from the past years.  
"After successfully expanding our services through the south and southeastern portion of the United States, I have never been so optimistic for the company's future," Zahn said. "We have additional expansion plans and look forward to better serving our customers."

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 01/19/2005
            

                BBB has determined that First Trinity Financial Corp. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.

First Trinity Financial Company First Trinity Financial Corporation ( FTFC ) is a financial holding company with its home office in Tulsa, Oklahoma. FTFC has two wholly owned subsidiaries: Trinity Life Insurance Company ( TLIC ) and First Trinity Capital Corporation ( FTCC ). FTFC successfully raised $15, 475, 000 through Private Placement and a public stock offering that was completed February 23, 2007. FTFC is currently owned by over 3700 Oklahoma residents. Since inception FTFC has dedicated itself to help stem the outflow of capital from our state by providing a broadly held Oklahoma financial services corporation offering innovative, attractive and competitive financial products and financial services. Our premium finance and life insurance subsidiaries began operations in early 2007, and shortly thereafter our country and the entire financial sector faced tremendous economic challenges and uncertainty. We have seen both the bond and stock market suffer tremendous losses along with the demise of several large financial institutions. As a result, the consumer confidence in our country's financial institutions has been shaken. However in spite of these turbulent economic times, First Trinity Financial has continued to grow. From December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2009, FTFC's assets grew from $12, 529, 238 to $49, 816, 843 an increase of $37, 287, 605 or 298%. Revenues during the same period have grown from $1, 635, 956 to $8, 542, 792 an increase of 422% while shareholder equity increased from $11, 779, 815 to $13, 250, 690 or 12.5 % To enhance our ability to meet our goals, FTFC plans to raise additional capital. In December 2009, documents were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Oklahoma Department of Securities to raise $10, 000, 000 of additional capital by selling new shares of common stock at $7.50 per share. We anticipate that this offering will become effective within the next few months.
