IPO Preview: VOC Energy Trust - VOC Energy Trust (NYSE:VOC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»IPO Preview: VOC Energy TrustMay. 2.11 | About: VOC Energy (VOC) IPOdesktop Value, IPOs, long onlyIPOpremiumVOC Energy Trust (NYSE:VOC) is scheduling a $222 million IPO with a market capitalization of $340 million at a proposed price range mid-point of $20 for Thursday 5, 2011. The  IPO calendar includes seven others for this week.
CONCLUSION -- Based in Austin, Texas, VOC offers an attractive 10.5% expected yield for 2011.  VOC, however, doesn’t have a (strong) parent similar to other successful trusts & partnerships, and VOC’s growth plan is not visible. In addition, 88% of the IPO proceeds revert directly to the sponsor.
SUMMARY -- VOC is a stand-alone trust oil without a strong parent.  VOC intends to sell 65% of the company on the IPO. VOC’s sponsors and related parties will retain 48% of the net proceeds from the underlying properties until the trust expires, then will retain 100% of the net proceeds.
The VOC trust has a 20 year life span and expires in 2030, or when 10.6 MMBoe (which is the equivalent of 8.5 MMBoe in respect of the Net Profits Interest) have been produced from the Underlying Properties and sold.
VOC Comparisons
Trusts and Limited Partnerships with strong parents typically sell a smaller percentage on the IPO than VOC.  For example two recent IPOs with strong parents increased in price after their IPOs.  Sandridge Mississippian Trust (NYSE:SDT) is up 23% to $25.72 from the IPO price of $21 on April 6, 2011.  See our pre-IPOreport on SDT
 Tesoro Logistics (NYSE:TLLP) is up 14% to $24 from the IPO price of $21 on April 19, 2011.  See our pre-IPOreport on TLLP
  CASH DISTRIBUTIONS -- Projected to be 10.5% or $2.09 per trust unit for the year ending December 31. 2011.  See page 56 in the S-1  You can read about the ‘significant assumptions used to prepare the projected cash distributions’ on pages 57-59 in the S-1, especially the table on page 60
INCOME TAX -- “The trust is not subject to income tax; trust unit holders are subject to income tax on their pro rata share of trust income, gain, loss and deduction.” Page 101 S-1
GROWTH PLAN -- VOC's growth plan is filled with disclaimers.  Trusts and Partnerships in the oil production and development business offer more visibility if they are spin-offs of a strong parent.
 
 
“The primary goals of VOC Sponsor’s development and workover program have been to develop proved undeveloped reserves, manage workovers and minimize the natural decline in production in areas in which it operates. However, VOC Sponsor is not obligated to undertake any development activities, so any drilling and completing activities will be subject to the reasonable discretion of VOC Sponsor. No assurance can be given, however, that any development well will produce in commercially paying quantities or that the characteristics of any development well will match the characteristics of VOC Sponsor’s existing wells or VOC Sponsor’s historical drilling success rate.”  Page 74, S-1  After giving effect to the conveyance of the Net Profits Interest to the trust, VOC Sponsor’s interest in the Underlying Properties will entitle it to 20% of the net proceeds from the sale of production of oil and natural gas attributable to the Underlying Properties during the term of the trust, and 100% thereafter.
MANAGEMENT -- Certain members of VOC Sponsor’s management team were involved in the formation and initial public offering of MV Oil Trust (NYSE:MVO) a publicly traded trust that is similar to VOC Energy Trust.  MVO has a market capitalization of $475 and the trust yield is 7.4%
VOC SPONSOR & THE OPERATOR -- Notice below that Vess Oil is the contract operator, not the sponsor. The trust units do not represent interests in, or obligations of, VOC Sponsor.
As of December 31, 2010, Vess Oil employed 19 full-time employees, three contract professionals and 14 contract personnel in its Wichita, office and in five field and satellite offices.
VOC's Sponsor believes that its retained interests in the Underlying Properties combined with VOC Partners, LLC’s ownership of trust units representing a 34.8% beneficial interest in the trust collectively entitles VOC Sponsor and VOC Partners, LLC to receive an aggregate of approximately 48% of the net proceeds from the Underlying Properties, which will provide sufficient incentive to operate and develop the oil and natural gas properties comprising the Underlying Properties in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

As of December 31, 2010, based on PV-10 value, the VOC Operators were the operators or contract operators of approximately 98% of the total proved reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties with Vess Oil operating, on behalf of VOC Sponsor, approximately 91% of the total proved reserves and L.D. Drilling Inc. and Davis Petroleum, Inc. operating approximately 7% of the total proved reserves.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS --  As of December 31, 2010, the VOC Operators, which includes Vess Oil, L.D. Drilling, Inc. and Davis Petroleum, Inc., operated or operated on a contract basis, approximately 98% of the total proved reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties based on PV-10 value.
Vess Oil operates approximately 91% of the total proved reserves for which VOC Sponsor is the designated operator and L.D. Drilling Inc. and Davis Petroleum, Inc. operates approximately 7% of the total proved reserves.
Vess Oil is controlled by J. Michael Vess, L.D. Drilling Inc. is controlled by L.D. Davis and Davis Petroleum, Inc. is controlled by both Mr. Vess and Mr. Davis. Under the terms of the operating arrangement among VOC Sponsor and Vess Oil, all expenses of Vess Oil incurred on behalf of VOC Sponsor are paid by VOC Sponsor at the cost incurred.
USE OF PROCEEDS of $204 million.  Repay $24.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, repurchase $65 million certain outstanding equity interests in the VOC sponsor, and make cash distributions to its remaining limited partners.
Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.About this article:ExpandTagged: Investing Ideas, IPO Analysis, Basic Materials, Independent Oil & GasWant to share your opinion on this article?

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

VOC Sponsor is offering all of the trust units to be sold in this offering, 
including the trust units to be sold upon the exercise of the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option. VOC Sponsor expects to receive net proceeds from the 
sale of 11,085,000 trust units offered by this prospectus of approximately 
$214.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, 
structuring fees and offering expenses, and an additional $32.5 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional trust units in full. 
Forty-five days following the closing of this offering, VOC Sponsor will sell 
any trust units not sold in this offering to VOC Partners, LLC at the initial 
public offering price. 
  
VOC Sponsor intends to use the net proceeds from this offering, including any 
proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional 
trust units and the sale of trust units to VOC Partners, LLC, to repay 
approximately $24.0 million of outstanding borrowings under its credit 
facility, to repurchase certain outstanding equity interests in VOC sponsor 
for approximately $67.9 million and to make cash distributions to its 
remaining limited partners. VOC Sponsor is deemed to be an underwriter with 
respect to the trust units offered hereby.


The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. VOC Sponsor competes 
with major oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas 
companies for oil and natural gas, equipment, personnel and markets for the 
sale of oil and natural gas. Many of these competitors are financially 
stronger than VOC Sponsor, but even financially troubled competitors can 
affect the market because of their need to sell oil and natural gas at any 
price to attempt to maintain cashflow. The trust will be subject to the same 
competitive conditions as VOC Sponsor and other companies in the oil and 
natural gas industry.
 
Oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, 
primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, 
coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil, natural gas 
or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, 
legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and 
other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas.
 
Future price fluctuations for oil and natural gas will directly impact trust 
distributions, estimates of reserves attributable to the trust’s interests 
and estimated and actual future net revenues to the trust. In view of the 
many uncertainties that affect the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, 
neither the trust nor VOC Sponsor can make reliable predictions of future oil 
and natural gas supply and demand, future product prices or the effect of 
future product prices on the trust.


Company Description
VOC Energy Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed in November 2010 by VOC 
Sponsor to own a term net profits interest representing the right to receive 
80% of the net proceeds (calculated as described below) from production from 
substantially all of the interests in oil and natural gas


 properties in the 
states of Kansas and Texas held by VOC Sponsor as of the date of the 
conveyance of the net profits interest to the trust. We refer to the conveyed
interest as the “Net Profits Interest.” The Net Profits Interest will 
terminate on the later to occur of (1) December 31, 2030, or (2) the time 
from and after January 1, 2011 when 10.6 MMBoe (which is the equivalent of 
8.5 MMBoe in respect of the Net Profits Interest) have been produced from the 
Underlying Properties and sold.

As of December 31, 2010, the Underlying Properties produced predominantly oil 
From approximately 881 gross (545.7 net) wells located in 191 fields. As of 
December 31, 2010, the Underlying Properties had a weighted average age 
(calculated on a PV-10 basis) of approximately 38 years, and assuming an 
average price of $79.43 per Bbl (the average per Bbl price for 2010), the 
weighted average expected remaining reserve life (calculated on a PV-10 basis)
of the reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties was approximately 
39 years as of December 31, 2010. Substantially all of the Underlying 
Properties are located in mature oil fields that are characterized by long
production histories and several additional development opportunities, which 
may help to diminish natural declines in production from the Underlying 
Properties. As of December 31, 2010, the total proved reserves attributable 
to the Underlying Properties were 13.7 MMBoe, of which approximately 84% were
classified as proved developed producing reserves, and approximately 92% were 
oil and approximately 8% were natural gas. Based on the reserve reports, the 
Net Profits Interest would entitle the trust to receive net proceeds from the
sale of production of 8.5 MMBoe of proved reserves during the term of the 
trust, calculated as 80% of the proved reserves attributable to the Underlying
Properties expected to be produced during the term of the trust. During the 
year ended December 31, 2010, average net production from the Underlying 
Properties was approximately 2,547 Boe per day (or 2,038 Boe per day 
attributable to the trust) comprised of approximately 88% oil and
approximately 12% natural gas. 
  
As of December 31, 2010, approximately 98% of the total proved reserves 
relating to the Underlying Properties, based on pre-tax present value of 
estimated future net revenue using a discount rate of ten percent per annum 
(“PV-10”), were operated, or operated on a contract operator basis, by Vess 
Oil Corporation (which we refer to as “Vess Oil”), L. D. Drilling Inc. or 
Davis Petroleum, Inc. (which we refer to collectively with Vess Oil as the 
“VOC Operators”). 

For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, VOC Sponsor has entered into swap 
contracts, which we refer to as the “hedge contracts,” at weighted average 
prices ranging from $94.90 to $100.87 per barrel of oil that hedge 
approximately 66% of expected oil production for such years from the proved
developed producing reserves attributable to the Underlying Properties in the 
summary reserve reports. The hedge contracts should help mitigate the impact
of any crude oil price volatility on distributions made on the trust units 
during the term of the hedge contracts. Upon expiration in 2013, unitholder 
exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices will increase significantly. 
  
The trust will make quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its
quarterly cash receipts, after deduction of fees and expenses for the
administration of the trust (which are estimated to be approximately $900,000 
in 2011), to holders of its trust units during the term of the trust. The 
first quarterly distribution is expected to be made on or about August 15, 
2011, to trust unitholders owning trust units on or about August 1, 2011. 
The trust’s first quarterly distribution will consist of an amount in cash 
paid by VOC Sponsor equal to the amount that would have been payable to the 
trust had the Net Profits Interest been in effect during the period from 
January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2011, less any general and administrative 
expenses and reserves of the trust. As a result of the extended period of 
time that will be included in the first quarterly distribution, subsequent 
quarterly distributions are likely to be less than the initial distribution. 
Because payments to the trust will be generated by depleting assets and the 
trust has a finite life with the production from the Underlying Properties 
diminishing over time, a portion of each distribution will represent, in 
effect, a return of your original investment. 
  
The trust will receive quarterly cash receipts from the net proceeds 
attributable to the Net Profits Interest, with such net proceeds generally 
being equal to 80% of the gross proceeds received from sales of oil and 
natural gas attributable to the Underlying Properties for each calendar 
quarter, less production and development costs and amounts that may be 
reserved for future development, maintenance or operating expenditures 
(which reserve amounts may not exceed $1.0 million in the aggregate at any 
given time), and after giving effect to the impact of the hedge contracts. 
Net proceeds payable to the trust will generally depend upon, among other 
things, the impact of hedge contracts, volumes produced, wellhead prices,
price differentials and production and development costs. If the trust does 
not receive net proceeds pursuant to the Net Profits Interest, or if such 
net proceeds are reduced, the trust will not be able to distribute cash to 
the trust unitholders, or such cash distributions will be reduced, 
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, lease operating expenses 
were $14.76 per Boe and production and property taxes were $4.45 per Boe, for 
an aggregate production cost for the Underlying Properties of $19.21 per Boe.
As substantially all of the Underlying Properties are located in mature 
fields, VOC Sponsor does not expect its total future production costs for the
Underlying Properties to change significantly as compared to recent historical
costs other than changes in costs due to any increases in the cost of general 
oilfield services in its operating areas. 
  
The amount of cash available for distribution by the trust will be reduced by 
the general and administrative costs of the trust. The business and affairs 
of the trust will be managed by The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, 
N.A. as trustee, and VOC Sponsor and its affiliates will have no ability to 
manage or influence the operations of the trust. 

--------

The principal offices of the trustee are located at 919 Congress Avenue, Suite 
500, Austin, Texas 78701, and its telephone number is  (512) 236-6599.
