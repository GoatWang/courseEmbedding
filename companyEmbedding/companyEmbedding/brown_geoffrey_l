Research
I am interested in social and emotional development in infancy and early childhood. My research has focused on the ways in which family relationships may mutually influence one another, and the contributions of family functioning to children's early development. I have a particular interest in fathering, and much of my research has explored the development of the early father-child relationship. Past work has examined the correlates of father involvement, paternal sensitivity, and father-child attachment security. Relatedly, I have also explored aspects of triadic (mother, father, and child) family interactions as important contexts for adaptive family functioning and child development. I am also interested in the role that family relationships play in the development of young children’s self-concepts. My current research is examining father-child relationships, emotion socialization, and children’s representations of attachment figures in diverse populations. It is my hope that this work will continue to make important contributions to our understanding of the family system as a crucial context for the social and emotional development of young children from a variety of racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds.

Geoff Goes In Depth
Sex, Lies, & Alibis: Pilot | Hotel Room

  "Sometimes when you go into a job with the smallest of budgets, options instantly cease to exist, but creativity can then be allowed to fly without fear of consequences. In this case, a four star hotel room was needed to be created inside of an empty home in Reseda, CA that was up for sale. With no choice but to find used furniture, I spent a day at a local outlet searching for hotel furniture. Knowing filming would focus on the entirety of the room, I focused on the key set pieces to bring the idea to life including a floating headboard, telescoping wall sconces, salvaged hotel drapery which coordinated with a matching chair and ottoman, and individual hospitality essentials. Out of money and still without the rest of the furniture, I negotiated with the previous owner to release left behind bedroom items meant for craigslist. The color of these items was straight out of the east coast in the '80's: pale cream. I needed a cheap but luxurious looking solution. I decided upon a rich espresso spray paint capable of hiding imperfections, yet creating a modern feel. Hired painters came in and rolled out a warm white with a hint of gold to compliment the strong green and brown earth tones established within the room. With a borrowed flat screen, office chairs, bedding and found carpet, the room eventually came together and we ended up with one of my favorite sets I've designed. This set is a case of knowing that having virtually no budget doesn't have to mean an empty room.”



Lost Coast Tapes | Drybeck's Cabin
 
 "Partnered with Chris Davis (Production Designer) we travelled up and into the Redwoods of upper Northern California and the towns of Arcata, Eureka and Ferndale. We were given just a week to source real wood items and supporting set pieces needed for a cabin interior, home to a "slightly off" hunter and woodsman. Our search was concentrated around local antique stores and second-hand shops. On a hunch, we walked into a gold store with an attached antique room for show. The room turned out to be a gold-mine of its own, revealing buffets, tables, a banker's desks, and a mail cabinet. The small shop also held a key find, a vintage table-top display case which would be used in the film to house a key hero prop. We negotiated with the gold store's owner who was more than hesitant to rent out these one of a kind items. Eventually I was able to negotiate a fair rental cost with the request to us that he would be allowed to visit the set for a day. In addition to the furniture, we really needed to show off how accomplished a local game hunter this character in the film was. With the assistance of the Wildlife Department located at Cal State University, Humboldt, we made a donation to their foundation and in exchange they released a group of beautiful local taxidermy to be displayed proudly by the film’s most unique character. (Please see black and white photos in Portfolio on this site.) This set turned out to be better than we imagined after an exhaustive search of local resources." 




Backwoods Pawn: Pilot | Exterior
 
"I was brought on to do a pilot in the town of London, Kentucky, an hour north of the Smokey Mountains. My vision was to redesign and update the exterior of the town's popular pawn shop with elements from the region’s history. The most important need was replacement of old vinyl signage with a new painted surface. In my design, I went with a University of Kentucky blue. Prior to leaving L.A., I called around to local paint stores to find a scenic painter who could turn my SketchUp design into real life. The property sits at the bottom of a hill one-quarter of a mile from a major local interstate off-ramp. As a result, a block san serif font was the logical choice for maximum readability, making "PAWN" easily seen. Along with the front reading "Highway 192 Pawn", I incorporated a regional Highway 192 sign into the garage facade, reflecting the local pride the people have for their highway that runs down into Tennessee. During my online research, I discovered a company two hours from London that builds and sells original whiskey barrels, often purchased in volume by Hollywood studios and Disney resorts. This find was meant to be. We braved a long drive into the mountains where signs and road markers ceased to exist. After finally finding the home business without an address or cell service, we purchased three barrels and enjoyed the strong aroma in the van ride back. The barrels were placed in a pyramid formation. To discourage those interested in free barrels, we dumped 200 pounds of sand into each barrel and 100 pounds of cement into the top barrel, sealing the flag pole with an attached state flag. The group sits proudly outside with a series of heavy duty rail road ties as parking blocks and a large American flag flying produly above the entrance. The genuine hospitality I experienced working in the area made this job one I will always remember."

Geoffrey Brown, Ph.D.
Research Assistant ProfessorDepartment of PsychologyClark UniversityWorcester, MA 01610-1477Phone: 508.793.8840 Email: gbrown@clarku.edu
Curriculum Vitae



Dr. Brown received B.S. and B.A. degrees from Furman University in 2001, and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in developmental psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2003 and 2008, respectively. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship through the Carolina Consortium on Human Development at the Center for Developmental Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Current Research and Teaching
Dr. Brown’s research is broadly focused on social and emotional development in infancy and early childhood. His work has taken a family systems perspective, with an interest in how all family members and family relationships may mutually influence one another. Much of his research has explored the role of the father in the family, and the development of the father-child relationship in the early years of life. His past work has explored the correlates of father involvement, paternal sensitivity, and father-child attachment security in early childhood. Relatedly, he has examined aspects of triadic (mother, father, and child) family interactions, such as maternal gatekeeping behaviors and the coparenting relationship, as important contexts for adaptive family functioning and child development. Dr. Brown is also interested in the role that family relationships play in the development of young children’s self-concepts, and how the child’s emergent personality develops within the family. Much of Dr. Brown’s current work is concerned with documenting family processes in diverse populations, including projects examining father-child relationships, emotion socialization processes, and children’s representations of attachment figures among families from a variety of racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds.
He has taught courses on general psychology, statistics, developmental psychology, attachment and the family system, and a laboratory course in developmental psychology.

A passion for sustainability, and a chicken project that took wing
After spending five months in Nicaragua, John Hite ’17 headed to Clark to major in Spanish and geography. For a sustainable development project in Mexico, he learned how small-scale farmers are adopting new ways of raising chickens, via mobile hen houses. Now he’s working with a Clark research team to develop a policy brief to mitigate deforestation in Mexico and elsewhere. “My research experience has given me a very real set of skills in researching and writing policy,” John says.

Welcome
Psychology psyche (breath, spirit, soul)
At Clark's nationally-known Frances L. Hiatt School of Psychology, faculty, graduate students and undergraduates search together for insight into questions that have fascinated people since the beginning of time. Why do we behave the way we do? How did this behavior evolve? What is the relationship between emotion and thought? How can we get along better with each other and live more satisfying lives?

Abstract


Most humans use walking as the primary form of locomotion for short distances. However, many scientific questions remain regarding how and why we walk the way we do. This thesis explores the energetics of “nonlinear” (or curved path) locomotion both by using computer simulations and optimization techniques as well as human subject experiments. Specifically we (1) Measure the metabolic cost of human walking around circular paths at various speeds and radii, (2) explain the trends in the metabolic cost data qualitatively using 3d trajectory optimization of a simple biped model, (3) use metabolic cost data to explain the observation that people walk slower around tighter curves and faster while walking around straight lines or bigger curves, and (4) use metabolic cost data to derive optimal locomotor paths for human walking.
