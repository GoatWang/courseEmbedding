 Unique growth. One-of-a-kind entertainment.  With over two decades of experience creating singular entertainment destinations, we’ve learned a few things about building customer experiences unlike any other — and about building relationships. Based on this success, and lessons learned at every step, Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment has brought this experience to new markets across the country. First, to Pennsylvania, with Mohegan Sun Pocono. Then, to Atlantic City, with the all-new Resorts. Most recently, we opened the spectacular ilani Resort in Washington State. And our expansion now reaches around the world, with South Korea’s amazing Inspire Resort — the first in the world with its own private air terminal.

UNCASVILLE, Ct., June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority (MTGA), operator of Mohegan Sun properties throughout the United States and developer of the Inspire Integrated Resort in South Korea, today announced it has changed its name to Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment (MGE). The name change better represents MGE's growing domestic and international portfolio of integrated resorts, and further aligns its all-encompassing brand image as an entertainment destination with future expansion plans.








"The change in the name to MGE has been made to better reflect where we are today as far as an overall entertainment company and our advancement as a major player in commercial gaming worldwide," said Mitchell Etess, CEO of Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment. "Our brand has become synonymous with outstanding gaming operations so this change is an organic development aligned with our brand evolution."
Since opening the doors to its flagship property in Connecticut in 1996, Mohegan Sun grew quickly into one of the Western hemisphere's premier integrated resorts, delivering unforgettable experiences to more than nine million visitors each year. From dining and shopping to professional sporting events and arena-sized performances, the brand's commitment to provide new and exciting offerings translated into more than 45 dining restaurants, bars and lounges; a full retail shopping center; a lavish spa; an 18-hole golf course; and three high-energy entertainment venues. Not to mention, Mohegan Sun's award-winning Arena that first opened in 2001 and has since grown into the world's highest grossing concert venue of its size with more than 10 million guests since the opening.
Based on its two decades of success, MGE has brought its renowned, all-encompassing resort experiences to new markets within the U.S. and globally. The brand's standard of excellence was established in Connecticut with the Mohegan Sun property, and came to life further through the brand's sister properties, Mohegan Sun Pocono in Pennsylvania, the Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J., the Ilani Resort in Washington State, and Project Inspire, currently in development in South Korea and intended to be the premier destination resort in Northern Asia.
"We have been honing our expertise for more than 20 years, and continue building a compelling brand with a global relevance, to further solidify our brand's role as an industry leader in integrated resort experiences," continued Etess. "Every one of our destinations has the unique vision of MGE to transcend gaming while revitalizing resort entertainment into a more immersive and exhilarating experience for our guests."

UNCASVILLE, Conn., Feb. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority (the "Authority" or "MTGA") today announced that President and CEO Robert Soper has resigned to pursue other opportunities effective immediately.  Former CEO Mitchell Grossinger Etess will act as interim CEO subject to necessary regulatory filings or approvals.








"Having served as General Manager of both our Connecticut and Pennsylvania properties, Bobby actively pursued the growth of the Mohegan gaming enterprise to ensure its viability and survivability in an ever-increasingly competitive industry, and he helped us achieve important gains across the country and around the world," said Kevin P. Brown, Chairman of the Management Board of the Authority.  "The Authority is on good footing with its lowest debt-leverage ratio since the recession; combined with the outstanding opportunities presented by a number of management agreements put into place under his stead, MTGA is postured to sustain the tribe for generations to come.   Mitchell's experience, and sustained connection over the past year, will allow us to sustain our progress while we commence the search for a new corporate leader."
"Though this is a time for change, it is important that we do not lose sight of all of this incredible progress.  We will rely on the inherent strengths of our entire team that continues to deliver memorable experiences and unmatched personalized services to our guests.  Our Core Values combined with the Spirit of Aquai and open communication, will ensure that we emerge an even stronger enterprise in this next cycle of our growth."
About the Authority
The Authority is an instrumentality of the Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut, or the Tribe, a federally-recognized Indian tribe with an approximately 595-acre reservation situated in southeastern Connecticut, adjacent to Uncasville, Connecticut. The Authority has been granted the exclusive authority to conduct and regulate gaming activities on the existing reservation of the Tribe, including the operation of Mohegan Sun, a gaming and entertainment complex located on an approximately 185-acre site on the Tribe's reservation. Through its subsidiary, Downs Racing, L.P., the Authority also owns and operates Mohegan Sun Pocono, a gaming and entertainment facility located on an approximately 400-acre site in Plains Township, Pennsylvania, and several off-track wagering facilities located elsewhere in Pennsylvania.
The Tribe's gaming operation at Mohegan Sun is one of only two legally authorized gaming operations in southern New England offering traditional slot machines and table games. Mohegan Sun currently operates in an approximately 5 million square-foot facility, which includes Casino of the Earth, Casino of the Sky, Casino of the Wind, 100,000 square feet of retail space, including The Shops at Mohegan Sun, a 10,000-seat Mohegan Sun Arena, a 350-seat Cabaret Theatre, 100,000 square feet of meeting and convention space, the 1,200-room luxury Sky Hotel Tower and the 400-room Earth Hotel Tower. Mohegan Sun Pocono operates in an approximately 400,000 square-foot facility, offering traditional slot machines and table games, live harness racing and simulcast and off-track wagering, a 238-room hotel, 20,000 square feet of meeting and convention space, several dining and retail options and a bus passenger lounge. More information about the Authority and its properties can be obtained by visiting www.mohegansun.com, www.mohegansunpocono.com, or www.mtga.com.
