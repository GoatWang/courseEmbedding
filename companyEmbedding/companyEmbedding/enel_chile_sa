Suppliers and Contractors 



Suppliers and Contractors
The main objective of all of Enel Group’s Global Procurement Units is to ensure the supply of equipment, goods, and services with the required quality standards.
The Enel Group bases the services it provides on an ethical commitment to customers, so that they may receive the expected quality of power supply.
Furthermore, the Enel Group’s global business management policy involves a commitment to the environment, from the purchasing of raw materials from suppliers to the end product sold to customers.
Additionally, we have a commitment to suppliers that purchasing processes are serious and transparent, so that bonds of trust can be established in the long term.
The Enel Group’s Global Procurement Organization is designed to leverage the group’s economy of scale, in terms of purchasing capacity and intelligence. By linking together our volume of purchases and our knowledge, we can guarantee and make use of Enel’s competitive advantages, while also best positioning ourselves in a constantly changing and challenging energy market.
The presence of Global Procurement includes people working in twelve countries, from California (San Diego) to China (Shanghai), and is organized with two units of global staff, four units for global purchasing, and eight units for local purchasing.
This regional organization is part of Global Procurement. For more information, click here.
Change in Access to the Purchasing System
As of October 20, 2014, access is available to 2One and all Enel Group systems through a single point of access for the entire Group: PortalOne.

The sixth edition of the Enel Group General Contracting Conditions came into force on July 1, 2016. The new model contract will be subject to conventions on works, services, and supplies agreed between the group’s companies and Enel suppliers.
The general conditions apply in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Chile, Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Romania, Slovakia, Russia, Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, and Argentina.

About Enel Open Data

Enel has decided to begin a new journey that will allow the sharing of corporate data to grasp the spirit and opportunities that the “Open Data” movement spread throughout the United States and the United Kingdom is offering to the business world.We operate in a scenario marked by the massive spreading of digital technologies and the need to reconfigure the modalities in which we communicate and relate with companies, institutions and citizens.In this context, we believe that the “open” sharing of corporate data can:improve the market in which we operate, accelerating the confrontation between the companies competing in the liberalised energy market and supporting the decision-making processes inside and outside our company;increase transparency, giving greater visibility to our activity and making the dialogue with citizens, institutions and local authorities more involving. Sharing economic and financial data and other information regarding corporate sustainability means increasing participation and fully facing the great challenges of the energy generation market in Italy and in the world;favour technological innovation that represents a major drive for the country’s economic growth. Making corporate data available means encouraging the development and spreading of new applications, mash-ups and viewing systems capable of improving important aspects of our daily life and that can help us face the issues associated with environmental sustainability.With these objectives in mind we implemented the data.enel.com projectthat will share the first data-sets regarding Enel, organising information into two groups: economic and financial data and sustainability data.Content can be downloaded in Excel, CSV and XML formats and will soon be available in Google Fusion Tables to enable the re-processing and visualisation with Google applications.Unless otherwise indicated, all contents of this website are subject to the Creative Commons license - Attribution - version 3.0. license.You can send comments, report mistakes or make suggestions on the project’s development by using the Social channels in EnelSharing or at the following web page www.enel.com/it-IT.Terms of useUnless otherwise indicated, all contents of this website are subject to the Creative Commons license - Attribution - version 3.0.Specifically, the content of this website can be freely copied, diffused, forwarded and adjusted to be integrated into other products and/or services, provided that the source data.enel.com is mentioned and that the following limitations are observed:the logo of Enel or any other company within the Enel Group can never be used;the use of any content does not imply Enel’s agreement or approval for their use, and Enel declines responsibility for such contents.The latter is only a summary of the conditions for using web contents, so please read the terms of the license that govern their diffusion.

Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.

For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018                                                   Enel Chile S.A.
