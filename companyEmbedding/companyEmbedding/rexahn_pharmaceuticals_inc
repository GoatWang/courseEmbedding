Rexahn Pharmaceuticals to Initiate ZoraxelTM Phase II Trial for Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction



Rockville, MD, May 13, 2010 – Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE Amex: RNN), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company commercializing potential best in class oncology and CNS therapeutics, today announced that it will initiate a Phase IIb clinical trial for ZoraxelTM in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED).
The Phase IIb study is designed to assess Zoraxel’s efficacy in approximately 225 male subjects, ages 18 to 65, with ED.  The double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week study will include the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) survey, and	quality of life study endpoints.  The Phase IIb study is expected to begin in the second half of 2010 and the preliminary data is expected to be available in 2011. The study will be conducted at multiple sites in the U.S.
Rexahn’s decision to move forward with the Phase IIb trial is supported by data from a Phase IIa proof of concept study of 39 ED patients treated with Zoraxel. The Phase IIa study was completed in May 2009 and demonstrated that Zoraxel consistently improved IIEF scores of treated subjects. Furthermore, the study found that treated subjects demonstrated a dose dependent treatment effect with improved erectile function and quality of life measures. Zoraxel was also found to be safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.

About Zoraxel™
Zoraxel is being developed as an orally administered tablet for on-demand use, and is one of three clinical stage compounds being developed by Rexahn. Zoraxel has a well established and excellent safety record in humans and studies demonstrate a lack of severe side effects associated with current standard of care phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitor ED drugs, such as priapism, severe hypotension, myocardial infarction, sudden death, increased intraocular pressure and sudden hearing loss. Zoraxel is a centrally acting, dual enhancer of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, whereas PDE-5 inhibitors  work in peripheral blood vessels. Zoraxel may be a more effective ED treatment for patients who are responsive or unresponsive to PDE-5 inhibitors. For more information, please visit “Q&A for ZoraxelTM” at www.rexahn.com.

Rexahn Pharmaceuticals to Present Data on Novel Anti-Cancer Small Molecule RX-8243 at the American Association for Cancer Research



Rockville, MD, April 15, 2010 – Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE Amex: RNN), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company developing potential best in class oncology and central nervous system (CNS) therapeutics, today announced that it will present pre-clinical data on its anticancer compound RX-8243 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 101st Annual Meeting, held in Washington, D.C., April 17-21, 2010, at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center.
These data on the anti-cancer activity of RX-8243 will be presented in a poster (abstract #3562) entitled, “Characterization of a novel small molecule with potent anticancer activity,” on Tuesday, April 20, 2010, from 9:00 am – 12:00 pm EDT in Exhibit Hall A-C, Poster Section 24, during the “Experimental and Molecular Therapeutics” session.

About RX-8243
RX-8243 is a novel isoquinolinamine analogue that inhibits Ark1 (Aurora A) kinase and other Ser/Thr kinases implicated in cancer progression. RX-8243 is a multikinase inhibitor that down-regulates signal molecules of RAS as well as PI3K pathways such as activated forms of ERK, p38 and Akt. Pre-clinical studies demonstrated that RX-8243 blocked tumor growth in xenograft models at low nanomolar concentrations. These studies also have shown RX-8243 to be more effective against paclitaxel, gemcitabine and cisplatin-resistant cancer cell lines when compared to the original cytotoxic cancer drugs. RX-8243 is part of a robust pipeline of pre-clinical anti-cancer compounds that Rexahn has developed to provide higher efficacy and to improve the quality of life and survival of patients.

Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Revolutionizing the Treatment of Cancer


















	Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, Inc.






About


Rexahn Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NYSE MKT: RNN) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing novel, best-in-class therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. The Company’s mission is to improve the lives of cancer patients by developing next generation cancer therapies that are designed to maximize efficacy while minimizing the toxicity and side effects traditionally associated with cancer treatment. Rexahn’s product candidates work by targeting and neutralizing specific proteins believed to be involved in the complex biological cascade that leads to cancer cell growth. Pre-clinical studies show that certain of Rexahn’s product candidates may be effective against multiple types of cancer, drug resistant cancers, and difficult-to-treat cancers, and others may augment the effectiveness of current FDA-approved cancer treatments. The Company has a broad oncology pipeline that includes three anti-cancer compounds currently in clinical development: Supinoxin; RX-3117; and Archexin®, and a novel nanopolymer-based drug delivery platform technology that may increase the bio-availability of FDA-approved chemotherapies.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
