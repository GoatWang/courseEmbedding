      him to the SAGE team and believe he will be an invaluable asset as we 
      advance our clinical and preclinical programs in orphan and acute CNS

      “SAGE’s targeted and differentiated approach to drug identification is 
      compelling and has shown promise in developing treatments for critical 
      and orphan CNS diseases,” said Mr. Pien. “I am privileged to join the 
      very talented SAGE team as the company works to discover, develop and 
      deliver important new medicines to patients in need.”

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
