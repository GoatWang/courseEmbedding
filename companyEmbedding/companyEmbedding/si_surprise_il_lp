Frank WessConcordConcord (label)Jazz (CD, LP) 




                    The title's a bit of a joke, given the image of money on the cover – but the album's a tight little set from this classic Basie tenorist, recorded with a largeish group that would have made his old boss proud!  Frank keeps things upbeat and soulful on most tracks – mostly blowing tenor, but also some of his famous flute, and some alto sax too – in the company of players who include Cecil Bridgewater and Greg Gisbert on trumpet, Scott Robinson on saxes, Steve Turre on trombone, and Richard Wyands on piano.  The best numbers are actually some of the more laidback ones – and the album features originals by Wess and Robinson that stand out from the rest of the tunes.  Titles include "Little Esther", "Short Circuit", "And So It Is", "Listen To The Dawn", "Tryin To Make My Blues Turn Green", "Blues In The Car", "Surprise Surprise", and "Small Talk". (Out of print.)  © 1996-2017, Dusty Groove, Inc. 




Additional Marks & Notes

    If something is noteworthy, we try to note it in the comments — especially
    if it is an oddity that is the only wrong thing about the record.
    This might include, but isn't limited to, warped records, tracks that skip,
    cover damage or wear as noted above, or strictly cosmetic flaws.




Used CD Grade

    We have only one grade for non-new CDs at Dusty Groove — "Used CD".
    This grade is somewhat all-encompassing, but we choose it because we try to offer
    Used CDs in the best shape possible. All of our Used CDs are guaranteed to play
    without skipping or flaws. If you purchase a Used CD from Dusty Groove,
    you have 1 week to play it to determine that it plays correctly — and if it does not,
    then you may return it for a full refund.


    With our Used CDs, you can expect the disc to be free of all but the lightest of
    surface marks — clean, and not dirty at all.  You can also expect the case to be
    clean (we often change the cases ourselves — putting fresh cases on Used CDs we
    handle) — and you can expect the booklet to be in good shape, unless noted
    otherwise. We will list any specific details/defects underneath the item — so
    look for notes on cutout marks in the case, stamps on the barcode, or details like that.

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!

A bit more definition would be helpful                                 Overall Rating:               Would Shop Here Again:               Likelihood To Recommend:   Full ratings for this review »                Paradigmpi                           Jul 27, 2017            I really like your inks - have used your brother inks for about 10 years and have found them EXCELLENT.

Jul 27, 2017  I did not realize how bad my first replacements were when I ordered a 2nd set. I now know they are not very good or my first order was ok. I really do not know. I learned a  lesson.
