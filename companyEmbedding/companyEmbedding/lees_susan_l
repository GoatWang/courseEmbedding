The Allstate Corporation

Tom Wilson, 58, is the chairman and chief executive officer of The Allstate Corporation. Wilson has served as CEO of Allstate since 2007 and became chairman of The Allstate Corporation's Board of Directors in 2008.
Wilson has held a number of senior executive positions at Allstate since 1995. As CEO, Wilson has led a multi-year transformation of Allstate to position it as the only insurer with differentiated brands targeted at each segment of the market. The emphasis has been not only on doing the right things, such as investing in cutting-edge innovation, improving efficiency and productivity, and shedding non-core assets, but in doing them in the right way — optimizing the pace of change, restructuring for the long term rather than the short term, honoring commitments to employees, agency owners, customers and communities, and investing in the people of Allstate. 
He joined Allstate in 1995 from Sears, Roebuck and Co. where he was vice president of strategy and analysis. He was managing director of mergers and acquisitions at Dean Witter Reynolds from 1986 to 1993 and held various financial positions at the Amoco Corporation from 1980 to 1986.
 Wilson is the vice chair of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and holds active leadership positions within the financial services industry and the community. He is a board member of State Street Corporation and the Financial Services Roundtable. He is also a member the Property and Casualty CEO Roundtable and the Financial Services Forum, as well as the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago. Wilson regularly offers comment and insight about timely business and policy topics in national media outlets, and his articles have been published in the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN.com.
Wilson is a trustee of Rush University Medical Center. He is committed to empowering youth and serves as the national and Illinois co-chair for WE Day. Wilson is also the co-chair of Get In Chicago, the public-private partnership to reduce violent crime among youth in Chicago. He has previously served as chairman of the Property and Casualty CEO Roundtable, chairman of the Financial Services Roundtable and deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
A native of St. Clair Shores, Michigan, Wilson holds an MBA from Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Michigan.

He is also a graduate of Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program.

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
