Nov 2, 2016, 4:04pm EDT














COSTA MESA, Calif., Nov. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (OTC: CETY) announced today that it has secured $420,000 in common stock venture financing at $.04 per share to capitalize on the international market expansion of CETY subsidiary Clean Energy HRS LLC's Clean Cycle™ ORC heat recovery steam generator.  The investment was made by Cybernaut Zfounder Ventures LLC's  Cyberfuture One LP fund.  
The investment in CETY will support the international market expansion of the Clean Cycle™ products, including pursuant to CETY's memorandum of understanding entered into in October 2016 with Mr. Bairui Tu, principal of China-based BR Energy.  The MOU lays the foundation for a China-based joint venture to manufacture and commercialize the Clean Cycle™ products in the People's Republic of China, the development of a commercial-scale manufacturing production facility in China to manufacture the products, and the planned distribution and sales of the Clean Cycle™ products in China.  
In addition to support for the pursuit of the joint venture in China, the proceeds will be used in support of CETY's marketing and sales of its products world-wide and to continue broadening and enhancing CETY's overall HRS solution portfolio.  "This latest investment in CETY reflects a high level of confidence by Cyberfuture One LP in CETY's ability to execute and in the market opportunity for its Clean Cycle™ products," said Meddy Sahebi, Executive Chairman of CETY.  
Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY stated, "We are excited to complete this platform investment managed by leading technology investor Cybernaut Zfounder Ventures LLC.  We believe this investment will lay the foundation for our continued market and product expansion, both inside and outside of the important China market, as well as further institutional and commercial partner investment in the Company.  We are confident that this validation by a key venture capital investor partner will help establish CETY as a significant participant in the portfolio of commercial, industrial, and utility customers seeking market-leading efficient economic sustainable energy solutions.  We at CETY are proud to team with Cybernaut Zfounder Ventures LLC and we look forward to working with Mr. Tu and his team in furtherance of the recently completed MOU to lead the next generation of sustainable distributed energy solutions in China."

COSTA MESA, Calif., Nov. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (OTC: CETY) announced today that it has secured $420,000 in common stock venture financing at $.04 per share to capitalize on the international market expansion of CETY subsidiary Clean Energy HRS LLC’s Clean Cycle™ ORC heat recovery steam generator.  The investment was made by Cybernaut Zfounder Ventures LLC’s  Cyberfuture One LP fund. 
The investment in CETY will support the international market expansion of the Clean Cycle™ products, including pursuant to CETY’s memorandum of understanding entered into in October 2016 with Mr. Bairui Tu, principal of China-based BR Energy.  The MOU lays the foundation for a China-based joint venture to manufacture and commercialize the Clean Cycle™ products in the People’s Republic of China, the development of a commercial-scale manufacturing production facility in China to manufacture the products, and the planned distribution and sales of the Clean Cycle™ products in China. 
In addition to support for the pursuit of the joint venture in China, the proceeds will be used in support of CETY’s marketing and sales of its products world-wide and to continue broadening and enhancing CETY’s overall HRS solution portfolio.  “This latest investment in CETY reflects a high level of confidence by Cyberfuture One LP in CETY’s ability to execute and in the market opportunity for its Clean Cycle™ products,” said Meddy Sahebi, Executive Chairman of CETY.  
Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY stated, “We are excited to complete this platform investment managed by leading technology investor Cybernaut Zfounder Ventures LLC.  We believe this investment will lay the foundation for our continued market and product expansion, both inside and outside of the important China market, as well as further institutional and commercial partner investment in the Company.  We are confident that this validation by a key venture capital investor partner will help establish CETY as a significant participant in the portfolio of commercial, industrial, and utility customers seeking market-leading efficient economic sustainable energy solutions.  We at CETY are proud to team with Cybernaut Zfounder Ventures LLC and we look forward to working with Mr. Tu and his team in furtherance of the recently completed MOU to lead the next generation of sustainable distributed energy solutions in China.”

 CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (OTCMKTS:CETY) Files An 8-K Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

Item 1.01 in its entirety. The other items of the Current Report
on Form 8-K are not amended, except that a new Exhibit 10.02 has
been included in this Amendment, thereby amending Item 9.01.


Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive
Agreement


Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the
Registrant) and Cyberfuture One LP, a Delaware limited
partnership (Subscriber) entered into a Subscription Agreement
dated October 31, 2016 to which the Registrant issued to
Subscriber an aggregate of 10,500,000 restricted common shares
(Shares) at a price of US$0.04 per Share, for total gross
proceeds of US$420,000. The restricted shares were offered by the
Registrant to the exemption from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, provided by Section 4(a)(2)
of the Act.



to the Subscription Agreement, the Registrant granted to the
purchaser piggyback registration rights with respect to the
Shares on any registration on behalf of the Registrant or
shareholder ETI Partners IV LLC and demand registration rights so
long as Subscriber holds at least 8% of the Registrants
outstanding common stock. to the Subscription Agreement, the
Registrant also granted to Subscriber the right to appoint an
observer to the Registrants board of directors, with such right
continuing until December 31, 2016, subject to possible extension
in the event the Registrant or its subsidiary Clean Energy HRS,
LLC (CE HRS) and CITIC PE or one or more of its affiliates enter
into a joint venture for the manufacturing and distribution of CE
HRSs products in China (the JV). to the Subscription Agreement,
the Registrant also granted to Subscriber the right to nominate
one person to be elected or appointed to the Registrants board of
directors, with such right being effective only upon and during
such time that the JV has been established, the JV continues

right to acquire the Convertible Debenture. Reddot agreed with
the Registrant that it acquired only the rights of the Registrant
with respect to the Convertible Debenture and was acquiring the
Convertible Debenture through escrow and was not purchasing the
Debenture from the Registrant, but solely had the same rights as
the Registrant to acquire the Convertible Debenture without any
representation or warranty from Investor other than as implied
with respect to its ownership of the Convertible Debenture.
Concurrently, the Registrant and Reddot agreed to amend the
Convertible Debenture once acquired by Reddot (a) to have a fixed
conversion price of $.005 per share, subject to equitable
adjustments resulting from any stock splits, stock dividends,
recapitalizations, or similar events or events with similar
effect (b) to have a fixed interest rate of ten percent (10%) per
annum with respect to both the redemption amount and including a
financing fee and any costs, expenses, or other fees relating to
the Convertible Debenture or its enforcement and collection, and
any other expense for or on account of the Registrant (in each
case with a minimum 10% yield in the event of payoff or
conversion within the first year), such amounts to constitute
additional principal under the Convertible Debenture, as amended,
and (c) as otherwise provided in the Escrow Funding Agreement .

On November 2, Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. announced it had secured $420,000 in common stock venture financing at $.04 per share. The investment was made by Cybernaut Zfounder Ventures LLC’s  Cyberfuture One LP fund.
The firm hopes to capitalize on the international market expansion of its Clean Cycle ORC heat recovery steam generator.   Per CETY, it signed a MOU in October 2016 with China-based BR Energy, which lays the foundation for a China-based joint venture to manufacture and commercialize the Clean Cycle products in China.
Meddy Sahebi, Executive Chairman of CETY remarked: “This latest investment in CETY reflects a high level of confidence by Cyberfuture One LP in CETY’s ability to execute and in the market opportunity for its Clean Cycle™ products.”
Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY observed:“We are excited to complete this platform investment managed by leading technology investor Cybernaut Zfounder Ventures LLC.  We believe this investment will lay the foundation for our continued market and product expansion, both inside and outside of the important China market, as well as further institutional and commercial partner investment in the Company.  We are confident that this validation by a key venture capital investor partner will help establish CETY as a significant participant in the portfolio of commercial, industrial, and utility customers seeking market-leading efficient economic sustainable energy solutions.  We at CETY are proud to team with Cybernaut Zfounder Ventures LLC and we look forward to working with Mr. Tu and his team in furtherance of the recently completed MOU to lead the next generation of sustainable distributed energy solutions in China.”
