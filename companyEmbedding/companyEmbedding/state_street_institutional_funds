Fund Objective
The Fund seeks long term growth of capital by investing at least 80% of its net assets under normal circumstances in common and preferred stocks and other typical equity securities of issuers that are tied economically to the U.S.

Principal Investment Strategy 
The portfolio managers combine various investment management styles, which may include core, growth and value, designed to produce a broadly diversified portfolio. As a result, the portfolio typically has characteristics similar to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500® Index), including average market capitalization and dividend yield potential. Stock selection is key to the performance of the Fund.

The S&P 500® Index is composed of five hundred (500) selected stocks, all of which are listed on national stock exchanges and spans over 25 separate industry groups.














Important Risk Information
Risk associated with equity investing include stock values which may fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions.
Derivative investments may involve risks such as potential illiquidity of the markets and additional risk of loss of principal.
Companies with large market capitalizations go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Larger companies tend to be less volatile than companies with smaller market capitalizations. In exchange for this potentially lower risk, the value of the security may not rise as much as companies withsmaller market capitalizations.
The Fund invests by sampling the index, holding a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. This may cause the fund to experience tracking errors relative to performance of the index.

Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.



1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
3. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
4. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.

Press Releases





 

State Street Launches Product and Technology Enhancements to Benefit Institutional Investors 25/10/2007 
 BOSTON – October 25, 2007 – State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT), the world’s leading provider of financial services to institutional investors, today announced recent enhancements to its product and technology offerings to strengthen its industry leading online information delivery tools for online information for its customers. 
 Net Asset Valuation (NAV) Distribution 
 State Street is expanding its net asset valuation (NAV) distribution capabilities to enhance its offering to mutual fund customers looking to outsource more of their distribution related activities. 
 State Street’s NAV distribution services provide mutual fund customers with monitoring against rules and tolerances, decision support comparison and trend analysis. After the customer’s monitoring phase is complete, State Street will customize the results, formatted specifically to the customer requirements and distribute to the customer’s targeted distribution lists. 
 “These NAV-related tasks, typically done manually, can be costly and prone to errors,” said Patrick Centanni, senior vice president of State Street’s product and technology solutions team. “By outsourcing NAV-related distribution responsibilities, mutual fund companies can reduce risk, eliminate expenses and realign its employee base to more core activities.” 
 State Street’s NAV distribution service will provide expert capabilities for handling distribution requirements including aggregation, monitoring, and business intelligence for all of its mutual fund customers. It will also ensure that the appropriate information is delivered in a secure, timely, and accurate fashion to each interested party. Furthermore, State Street’s US business operating teams will provide research and support services to all customer inquiries. 
 Socially Responsible Investing 
 State Street recently launched enhanced capabilities for compliance and risk monitoring to include the monitoring and detection of portfolio holdings to track companies in violation of socially responsible and country specific investing guidelines. 
 Through an agreement with Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a leading provider of corporate governance, environmental and SRI data, State Street can now monitor, detect, and deliver valuable information to its customers in support of highly sensitive restrictions. 
 State Street compliance specialists now have the ability to leverage the flexibility of a compliance application to test investment criteria, including alcohol, animal welfare, gambling, emissions, chemical and oil spills, among other categories. Additionally, State Street is now able to utilize the same business processes and technologies for country specific governance policies. 
 To further enhance the offering, State Street’s customer compliance results will be delivered via my.statestreet.com’s compliance dashboards, which offer State Street customers a secure and convenient portal to view alerts, status updates and monitor progress towards resolution. 
 Liability Modeling 
 State Street has introduced a solution for liability modeling which allows customers to view their future liability cash flows as line items within a portfolio. The liability instrument can be set up as one distinct instrument or as a series of distinct instruments. This capability allows customers to have the flexibility of viewing their liability structure on-line, as well as being able to leverage the risk application’s comprehensive functionality features such as stress testing, shocks and ”what-if” analysis for the liability structure, along side their invested assets. 
 Customers, such as pension funds, require the integration of liabilities derived by their actuaries into the risk-measurement systems in order to help them monitor asset allocation strategies which keep pace with movements in their liabilities.
  About State Street 
 State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT) is the world's leading provider of financial services to institutional investors, including investment servicing, investment management, and investment research and trading. With US$15.1 trillion in assets under custody and US$2.0 trillion in assets under management, as of September 30, 2007, State Street operates in 26 countries and more than 100 geographic markets worldwide.
