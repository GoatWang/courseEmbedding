Kristina Salen



Kristina Salen and her husband, Daniel Bernstein, live in Brooklyn, NY, with kids Jules, 11, and Arlo, 8.
My Job
As CFO since last year of an online marketplace with one million vendors of handmade goods, my job is to help others do. I’m a strategic therapist. I listen to my colleagues, listen for opportunities, hear their problems and help them prioritize. A CFO’s job is really to enable growth over a multi-year period, to help determine whether plans will sustain growth. My day is filled with meetings: with our head of global facilities to talk about 10-year real estate plans, then with our chief technical officer, then with our VP of international to talk about a global challenge. I work with 500 passionate people in a mission-driven company with a strong sense of purpose. We believe we’re reimagining commerce. We’re a model that will create a more fulfilling and connected world that goes beyond price and convenience— creating a real connection between our 30 million active buyers and our sellers.
**
How Work Life Works**
Not so well over the past year. I started this new job in a new field and moved my family from Boston to New York City, meaning a lot of change and long hours and massive to-do lists. It’s been chaos, and challenging to find calm in the storm, but it’s okay as long as we all take deep breaths. My husband is a partner in the fullest sense—we only allow ourselves one freak-out at a time. He’s been a stay-at-home dad for a decade, and it hasn’t always been easy. He’s the point person on pretty much everything kids and home, so the burden is lifted from me. I do the laundry because I like to. And since I travel a fair amount, I do everything I can do from my phone at the airport.
Staying Connected
I travel one or two months out of the year. Otherwise, it’s a real gift that I see my kids every morning. I make sure they’re dressed, have breakfast and are out the door with Daniel. I get home a little after 6 and get dinner on and do kid stuff and then go back online at 9 p.m. I go in to work late on Fridays—when I have the luxury of walking my kids to school. I take them to ballet classes and drum lessons on the weekends. It’s about the little consistent things: walking to school, cuddling on the couch, waking the boys with kisses.
Family Time
It’s dinnertime, nearly every night. My husband is a trained chef, and that’s lucky. We talk about all kinds of stuff: school, big-picture issues like why dogs and cats have to be neutered, whatever comes up. On weekends, with the kids’ classes and all, we focus on nighttimes. We have movie night—recently it was Raiders of the Lost Ark. We like to have other families over for dinner. We set the table nicely with place cards. It’s a family date night for everyone. As for date night with my husband, our regular one fell away with the demands of my new job and our new home, but once a month we go out to dinner or do something. By September we should be through the transition.
In My Bag

A mess, usually
Macbook Air
A drawing by Arlo
A lucky necklace Jules made in preschool
A cosmetic bag full of lipsticks I never wear
A ton of old receipts and to-do lists
A pinecone or crab claw seasonally

My Favorite Things
Listening to cheesy Top 40 music, getting dressed up (and reliving the prom), reading medieval crime noir (like The Name of the Rose).
—As told to Barbara Turvett

Etsy hires Fidelity star Kristina Salen as CFO, downplays predictions of IPO

In the course of building a company, few factors contribute more to success or failure than the makeup of the executive leadership team. The thing is, the individuals that are right for a company at its earliest stages are not necessarily the same people who are right when the company scales massively and inevitably begins thinking IPO. There’s even a debate raging on this topic in Silicon Valley, with many adopting the cult of belief that founders should never be replaced, and others believing that there’s a right person for each role in each stage of a company’s life.
Today, Etsy, New York’s darling craft marketplace, announced the addition of a new CFO. Kristina Salen, 41, will join the company beginning in February, following seven years leading Fidelity Investments' media, Internet and telco group. Salen has experience leading “tens of billions of dollars” worth of investments, including in such high growth startup and tech companies as Google, eBay, Amazon, Spotify, and Hubspot.
Prior to Fidelity, Salen worked in various financial and executive roles at Oppenheimer Capital, Merrill Lynch, and Lazard Freres & Co. She holds an MBA in finance from Columbia University and was designated a Fulbright Scholar in Political Science and Economics following earning her undergraduate degree at Vassar College.
This is all well and good, but if you listened to Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson announcing the news during tonight’s PandoMonthly fireside chat, he sounded just as excited that she’s been a member of the marketplace since 2008. “She buys a lot of things on Etsy,” he said. “I don’t think she makes and sells stuff, but maybe she has a secret account. But we're really excited about her. I think she really rounds out the management team.”
Prior to Salen, Etsy had gone without a CFO. Initially, the company contracted an outside CFO and consultant named John McCarthy, a move not uncommon among resource constrained startups. As of late, the senior most person on the finance side of the business has been VP of Finance Sinohe Terrore. Terrore’s has described his role at the company as “managing the Business Intelligence, Finance, Accounting, and Operations teams.”
Dickerson, who was not the founder of Etsy himself, was quick to talk about “what adding a CFO means” at this stage. Many outside the company have looked for it to pursue an IPO in the near future. With hundreds of thousands of active sellers, more than 40 million monthly unique visitors per month to its site, and some $91 million in venture capital raised, all signs point toward such a public listing. But the CEO says that it’s more about options, not just an IPO.
“The reason I brought on Christina is that as Etsy grows, we can think about all the options,” he said. “I want Etsy to be an independent company for as long as it can be independent.”
Dickerson pointed to SurveyMonkey as a company that pursued an alternative path. The company recently did an $800 million recapitalization, taking on debt financing. They were able to pay back all their outside investors without going public and have all of the benefits of staying private.
He is smart to take what he calls a “more sophisticated view." Another wrinkle the CFO hopes to incorporate into any liquidity strategy is rewarding the community members. The example he gave is the Boston Beer IPO, in which the company’s customers got first right to buy its stock, ahead of Wall Street. The opposite example might be Facebook, whose users posted on its own platform requests for the $100 or so  they each represented at the time of its now flop of an IPO.
“Doing something like SurveyMonkey did is very complex,” Dickerson said. “If Etsy wanted to do something like that, I think we need a finance person.”
