				About Us			


Corporate Overview
Lexicon Pharmaceuticals is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that is applying a unique approach to gene science based on Nobel Prize-winning technology to discover and develop precise medicines for people with serious, chronic conditions. Using a patient driven approach, we are working to discover and develop innovative medicines to safely and effectively treat disease and improve patient lives.
Precision Science: The Genome Fuels Our Discovery
Through our Genome5000™ program, Lexicon scientists spent more than a decade studying the role and function of nearly 5,000 genes to pinpoint the key targets for drug development. This systematic, targeted approach led us to identify more than 100 protein targets with significant therapeutic potential in a wide range of diseases. These precise targets serve as our roadmap for the development of pioneering medicines that have the potential to improve the standard of care for patients so that they can live better, more empowered lives.
Pioneering Medicines: Improving the Standard of Care
Our passion is to bring medicines to the market that have the potential to improve the standard of care for diseases that have not experienced new treatment innovation in years – decades, in some cases. We are not driven by any particular disease area or patient population. Rather, using our roadmap of precise targets, we intentionally seek out relatively unexplored mechanisms. Our approach may not be the easiest path, but we believe that, in the long-term, it will ultimately provide the greatest benefit to patients.
Patient Driven: Improving Patient Lives
We believe in treating people, not just diseases. Our focus is patient driven and we are committed to listening, assisting and working with patient communities to best serve the patient. Our goal is to generate truly impactful solutions for patients that will make meaningful, long-term improvements in their lives.

				Pipeline			


Through our unique approach to gene science based on Nobel Prize-winning technology, we are moving forward rapidly to bring innovative therapies to market.
We have advanced multiple drug candidates into clinical development. We are presently devoting most of our resources to the development and commercialization of our two most advanced drug candidates, telotristat ethyl for carcinoid syndrome diarrhea and sotagliflozin for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We have also advanced a number of additional compounds into various stages of clinical and preclinical development.
Sotagliflozin (LX4211)
Sotagliflozin, or LX4211, is an orally-delivered small molecule compound that we are developing for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Sotagliflozin was internally generated by our medicinal chemists and inhibits both sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2, or SGLT2, a transporter responsible for most of the glucose reabsorption performed by the kidney, and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 1, or SGLT1, a transporter responsible for glucose and galactose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Our scientists identified mice lacking SGLT1, SGLT2 or both as having potent anti-diabetic phenotypes across multiple measures of glucose control and metabolism, and found that compounds inhibiting both targets had a favorable preclinical profile relative to compounds selective for SGLT2.

				Lexicon’s Position on Offering Compassionate Use to Investigational Medicines			



How the FDA Views Access
FDA position on access to investigational drugs outside of a clinical trial (Expanded Access).
Read more…
 
 
 

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is focused on developing breakthrough treatments for human disease. To do this, Lexicon conducts clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of investigational medicines, which if proven safe and effective, will allow Lexicon to seek the necessary approvals from regulatory authorities to provide patients with access to these medicines. In general, Lexicon believes that participating in clinical trials is the best way for patients to access investigational medicines prior to approval. In some extreme circumstances, when this is not possible, patients with life-threatening diseases or conditions may seek special access to investigational medicines outside of a clinical trial setting. These situations are typically referred to as compassionate use, but also are known as expanded access, early access, pre-approval access, and emergency use.
The clinical development process (the process by which a drug is developed and tested for safety and efficacy, and if proven safe and effective, is submitted to regulatory authorities for approval for use) involves controlled testing in humans to ensure both safety and efficacy. Because it is not known during clinical development whether an investigational medicine is safe or effective, compassionate use may present risks for both the patient and the clinical development program. For patients, compassionate use may bring potential safety risks or a false sense that the medicine will provide benefit; for the clinical development program, it can delay or jeopardize the approval of a new medicine being sought by many.
Conducting clinical trials is extremely complex and challenging. The ultimate goal is the rigorous testing of the clinical product with the aim of securing regulatory approval and enabling the medicine to be available to as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible. Lexicon has ethical responsibilities to ensure the quality and integrity of clinical trials and to minimize risks to current research participants and future patients. These ethical responsibilities require that strict criteria are applied for the compassionate use of its investigational medicines.
Lexicon considers many factors when considering a request for compassionate use of an investigational medicine, such as the strength of the clinical data, the known benefits and risks to the patient, the impact on the clinical development program, the phase of development, and the probability/ timing of regulatory approval.
At Lexicon, a compassionate use program, or a single request for compassionate use of an investigational medicine, will only be considered if all of the following conditions are met:

The disease or condition being studied is serious or life-threatening.
There are no adequate alternative therapies or clinical trials available.
Sufficient preliminary efficacy and safety data exist about the investigational medicine in order for Lexicon to make a benefit-risk analysis consistent with the establishment of a compassionate use program. This would not occur earlier than the time that results from Phase 2b studies are known, and depending on the clinical program, potentially even later.
Sufficient clinical data are available to identify an appropriate dosage.
The patient’s treating physician and Lexicon’s Chief Medical Officer (or equivalent position) both have evidence to believe there is the potential for the specific patient under consideration to reasonably expect benefit from the treatment, and there is ample evidence to support the possibility that the benefit will outweigh the potential risk of treatment.
An adequate supply of the investigational medicine exists to support both the ongoing clinical trials and approved compassionate use, until (and if) the product becomes commercially available.
The patient is not eligible for a Lexicon-sponsored clinical trial of the investigational medicine. Geographic limitations to participation in a trial would generally not fulfill this criterion.
Granting access to the investigational medicine must not interfere with the completion of clinical trials that could support regulatory approval of the medicine or otherwise compromise the potential development of the investigational medicine.
The request must be made by the patient’s treating physician, unsolicited by Lexicon or any other individual or organization.
The patient is a resident of a country in which Lexicon retains development and commercialization rights to the investigational medicine. Lexicon cannot make a guarantee that a compassionate use program will be available, and, even if a compassionate use program is offered, Lexicon cannot guarantee that the investigational medicine will be available to a particular patient.

If all these conditions are met, Lexicon will consider compassionate use requests from treating physicians, subject to applicable laws and regulations. All requests will be evaluated in a fair, unbiased manner. Patients with any underlying medical condition(s), that may pose safety risks (or those that have not been sufficiently characterized/studied), would not be granted compassionate use. Any pre-approval access to investigational product must always comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and approvals must be secured as required from applicable regulatory bodies and Institutional Review Boards or Ethics Committees. If approved, the patient (or his or her guardian) must provide informed consent and consent to comply with the safety and monitoring requirements defined by Lexicon. The treating physician must also agree to comply with all applicable safety and monitoring requirements. Compassionate use will cease being made available once the investigational medicine becomes commercially available or if, as demonstrated by clinical trials, the investigational medicine does not demonstrate a positive benefit-risk to patients.
Patients who believe they have a medical need and meet Lexicon’s criteria for compassionate use should speak to their treating physicians, who can make a request via the following: This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.. Lexicon expects that it will acknowledge receipt of any such requests within 10 business days.
When clinical trial records containing information about expanded access to Lexicon’s investigational products become publicly available pursuant to section 402(j)(2)(A)(ii)(II)(gg) of the Public Health Service Act, Lexicon will add a hyperlink or other appropriate reference to those records on this website page.
As authorized by the 21st Century Cures Act, Lexicon may revise this position statement at any time.  Additionally, the posting of this position statement by Lexicon shall not serve as a guarantee of access to any specific investigational drug by any individual patient.

	RESULTS AND PROVIDES A BUSINESS UPDATE









	XERMELO™ (telotristat ethyl) 250 mg approved by the FDA on February 28, 2017









	Strong start to XERMELO Launch









	Conference Call and Webcast at 6:00 pm EDT / 5:00 pm CDT









	The Woodlands, Texas, May 2, 2017


	 -


	Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.


	 (Nasdaq: LXRX), today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and provided an overview of key milestones for the company’s newly-launched commercial product, XERMELO™, and its pipeline drug candidates.









	“The first quarter was a transformative one for Lexicon marked by the approval and launch of XERMELO in the U.S. I am extremely proud of the extraordinary men and women at Lexicon who ensured that XERMELO was available to patients within days following approval,” said Lonnel Coats, Lexicon’s president and chief executive officer. “Eight weeks into the launch, we continue to make significant strides in providing access to XERMELO and communicating its benefits to patients. We are very pleased with the speed and depth of XERMELO adoption, which we believe is a reflection of the early positive feedback we have received from both patients and physicians. In addition, we continue to advance our robust pipeline of drug candidates and look forward to reporting on multiple milestones, including new data from our three Phase 3 sotagliflozin trials, starting this month.”









	First Quarter 2017 Product and Pipeline Progress









	XERMELO (telotristat ethyl) 250 mg


















	•






	On February 28



	th



	, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved XERMELO as the first and only oral therapy for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in combination with somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy in adults inadequately controlled by SSA therapy.
















	•






	Prescriptions for XERMELO were available to patients that same day, and the drug was available for shipment within 72 hours of launch.
















	•






	The Company initiated its LexCares™ program within hours of launch to ensure access and appropriately remove adherence hurdles for patients in need of this innovative therapy.












	Sotagliflozin


















	•






	In May, the Company expects to report additional efficacy data from the U.S. Phase 3 inTandem1 study. Data will include secondary endpoints such as body weight and blood pressure in hypertensive type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients.
















	•






	In Q3 2017, Lexicon anticipates additional data release from the E.U. and Israel Phase 3 inTandem2 study in patients with T1DM. Data will include secondary endpoints such as body weight and blood pressure in hypertensive T1DM patients, as well as pooled continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) results from inTandem1 and inTandem2.
















	•






	Lexicon previously announced that primary endpoints were met in both the inTandem1 and inTandem2 studies, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in A1C at 24 weeks on a background of optimized insulin.
















	•






	The Company anticipates top-line data release in mid-2017 from the global Phase 3 inTandem3 study evaluating approximately 1,400 T1DM patients treated with sotagliflozin 400mg once daily or placebo on a background of any insulin therapy, but without insulin optimization prior to randomization. The primary endpoint of the study is





























	the proportion of patients with A1C less than 7.0% and no severe hypoglycemia and no diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) events.













	•






	Lexicon’s partner, Sanofi, continues to enroll type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in several Phase 3 clinical trials.












	LX2761


















	•






	Phase 1 clinical trials for LX2761 remain ongoing, and the Company anticipates the release of data this year from these studies in healthy subjects and patients with T2DM.












	LX9211


















	•






	The Company expects to file an IND for LX9211 in neuropathic pain in mid-2017, followed by initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial this year.












	First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights









	Revenues:


	 Lexicon’s revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased to $18.3 million from $12.5 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to revenues recognized from the collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 included $0.7 million of net revenues recognized in March 2017 from the sale of XERMELO in the U.S.









	Cost of Sales:


	Lexicon had cost of sales related to sales of XERMELO of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, including finite-lived intangible asset amortization. Lexicon began capitalizing inventory during the three months ended March 31, 2017 following FDA approval of XERMELO, as the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product. Manufacturing costs for XERMELO incurred prior to FDA approval were recorded as research and development expenses. The pre-commercialization inventory of XERMELO is expected to be sold over approximately the next two years. As a result, cost of sales for XERMELO for the next two years will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials than would otherwise be expected. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, intangible assets relating to XERMELO of $24.7 million were reclassified from indefinite-lived to finite-lived assets once the FDA approved XERMELO, and the Company began amortizing this asset using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. Cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 includes $0.1 million of amortization of this intangible asset.









	Research and Development Expenses:


	 Research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased 18 percent to $43.6 million from $37.0 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to increases in external clinical development costs relating to sotagliflozin.









	Increase in Fair Value of Symphony Icon Purchase Liability:


	 In connection with the acquisition of Symphony Icon, Lexicon made an initial estimate of the fair value of the liability for the associated base and contingent payments. Changes in this liability, based on the development of the programs and the time until such payments are expected to be made, are recorded in Lexicon’s consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of the Symphony Icon purchase liability increased by $2.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, Lexicon made the final payment in cash and common stock related to the Symphony Icon purchase liability.









	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:


	 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased 77 percent to $14.9 million from $8.4 million for the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to increased costs incurred in connection with the commercial launch of XERMELO.









	Income Tax Benefit:


	  Income tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $8.7 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, Lexicon’s valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets decreased by $8.7 million due to the reclassification of intangible assets relating to XERMELO from indefinite-lived to finite-lived assets. This resulted in the related deferred tax liability now being considered a source of taxable income. Lexicon recorded an


























	$8.7 million deferred tax benefit with a corresponding reduction in its deferred tax liability in the three months ended March 31, 2017 as a result of this reclassification.









	Consolidated Net Loss:


	 Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $34.9 million, or $0.33 per share, compared to a net loss of $34.9 million, or $0.34 per share, in the corresponding period in 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, net loss included non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively.









	Cash and Investments:


	 As of March 31, 2017, Lexicon had $259.7 million in cash and investments, as compared to $346.5 million as of December 31, 2016. Cash used during the three months ended March 31, 2017 included a final $10.5 million cash payment to Symphony Icon and significant funding in support of Lexicon’s Phase 3 clinical trials of sotagliflozin in T1DM, which the Company expects will decrease as 2017 progresses. Lexicon’s use of cash remains consistent with prior guidance, and the Company continues to expect that its current liquidity and capital resources, together with expected revenues, will be sufficient to fund its operations at least through 2018.

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Key Developments

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Enters in to Collaboration and License Agreement with Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland Gmbh
Jul 7 17
On July 1, 2017, Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. entered into an amendment no. 1 to collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, amending the terms of the collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi, dated November 5, 2015. Under the amendment, the clinical development milestones under the agreement were amended to reflect an amended development plan for type 2 diabetes. Under the amended clinical development milestones, the company is eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $110 million upon the achievement of four development milestones relating to the results of certain Phase 3 clinical trials of sotagliflozin in type 2 diabetes patients and $100 million upon the achievement of a milestone based on the results of either of two outcomes studies in type 2 diabetes patients, the completion of which would likely occur after initial regulatory approval of sotagliflozin in type 2 diabetes. In addition, with respect to milestones that were not modified by the Amendment, the company remain eligible to receive up to $220 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones and up to $990 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones.


Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces Sotagliflozin Data from Pivotal inTandem1 and inTandem2 Studies in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes
Jun 10 17
Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced data from its two pivotal sotagliflozin studies, inTandem1 and inTandem2, being presented at the 77thAmerican Diabetes Association (ADA) Scientific Sessions in San Diego, CA. Collectively, 24-week data from the two pivotal inTandem1 and inTandem2 studies for sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes demonstrated the following: Sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg on top of optimized insulin significantly reduced A1C compared to placebo; Sotagliflozin was generally well tolerated. In both studies, there was a low rate of severe hypoglycemia, which occurred less frequently on sotagliflozin than placebo in three of four arms across the two studies. In both studies, there was a low diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) rate (0.4% to 3.1% over 24 weeks) that was higher for patients on insulin pump versus multiple dose injections (MDI). inTandem1 met its primary endpoint of change in A1C from baseline after a 24-week treatment period. The percentage reduction in A1C from baseline after 24 weeks of treatment were 0.08%, 0.43% and 0.49% for placebo, 200 mg, and 400 mg, respectively.


Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Reports Positive Top-Line Results In Phase 3 inTandem3 Study For Sotagliflozin In Patients With Type 1 Diabetes
Jun 9 17
Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced positive top-line results from its Phase 3 inTandem3 study of sotagliflozin, an investigational dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes on any background insulin therapy. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating the superiority of sotagliflozin 400 mg compared to placebo in the proportion of patients with A1C Sotagliflozin demonstrated a generally well tolerated safety profile during a 24-week treatment period, with rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and discontinuations due to AEs that were consistent with rates seen in two prior pivotal Phase 3 studies, inTandem1 and inTandem2, including a similar rate of severe hypoglycemia for the sotagliflozin arm compared to placebo during the 24-week treatment period (2.4% for placebo compared to 3.0% for sotagliflozin 400 mg) and a slightly higher rate of DKA during the 24-week treatment period for sotagliflozin 400 mg (3.0%) than placebo (0.6%). A full analysis of the results from inTandem3, including safety data, will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in discovering and developing breakthrough treatments for human disease. The company was founded in 1995 in The Woodlands, Texas under the name Lexicon Genetics, Incorporated by co-founders Arthur T Sands, Ray B Webb and.[1] The company has used its patented mouse gene knockout technology and extensive in vivo screening capabilities to study nearly 5,000 genes in its Genome5000 program and has identified over 100 potential therapeutic targets. Lexicon has advanced multiple drug candidates into human clinical trials and has a broad and diverse pipeline of drug targets behind its clinical programs. Lexicon is pursuing drug targets in five therapeutic areas including oncology, gastroenterology, immunology, metabolism, and ophthalmology.
The company's clinical drug candidates include sotagliflozin (LX4211) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; LX1033 for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal disorders; telotristat ethyl (LX1032) for the treatment of the symptoms associated with carcinoid syndrome; and LX2931 for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Company history[edit]




A Lexicon Genetics knockout mouse (left) that is a model of obesity, compared with a normal mouse.


Lexicon Pharmaceuticals was founded in September 1995 as a biotech venture of Baylor College of Medicine. The company went public in April 2000 with one of the largest initial public offerings in biotech history ($220 million).[2] In June, 2001 Lexicon purchased a privately owned small chemical library synthesis company, Coelacanth Corporation in Princeton, New Jersey,[3] which became the site for the company's small molecule and medicinal chemistry efforts. The company's original name was Lexicon Genetics Incorporated, but in 2007, the name changed to Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to reflect a renewed focus on drug development.
The company initially focused on using gene knockout technology to define the function of genes. This effort complemented and benefited from the international effort to sequence the human and mouse genomes (see Human Genome Project). Using its proprietary gene trapping and gene targeting technologies, the company created the world’s largest repository of genetically modified mouse embryonic stem cells, known as OmniBank, and established a large-scale mammalian knockout program to discover the physiological and behavioral functions of the most druggable mammalian genes.[4] The information collected from this program is stored in the company’s LexVision database, which contains almost 5,000 gene knockouts studied. Over the years, Lexicon evolved from a genomics company into a drug discovery and development company focused on discovering and developing breakthrough treatments for human disease. The company currently has multiple drug candidates in various stages of clinical trials.
Technology[edit]
Lexicon uses patented gene trapping and gene targeting technologies to generate and study knockout mice to discover the physiological and behavioral effects that result from the disruption of a single gene knockout.[5] Because there is a close similarity in gene function and physiology between mice and humans, with a large majority of human genes having a counterpart in the mouse genome,[6] knockout mouse technology has become a powerful tool in the discovery of new medicines.
The value of Lexicon’s technology in drug discovery has been described in a retrospective analysis by the scientific journal Nature. The conclusion of this analysis was that, in most cases, there was a direct correlation when comparing the physiological characteristics, or phenotypes, of knockout mice to the therapeutic effect of the 100 best-selling drugs of 2001.[7] The tremendous utility of knockout mouse technology was recognized in 2007 with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Drs. Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans, and Oliver Smithies.[8]
In developing small molecule drugs for its validated targets, Lexicon uses sophisticated medicinal chemistry known as "click chemistry." Dr. K. Barry Sharpless, who was awarded the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry,[9] pioneered this set of powerful and reliable tools for the rapid synthesis of novel compounds. Lexicon uses solution-phase chemistry to generate diverse libraries of optically pure compounds that are built using highly robust and scalable organic reactions that allow the company to generate compound collections of great diversity and to specially tailor the compound collections to address various therapeutic target families Lexicon’s medicinal chemists design these libraries by analyzing the chemical structures of drugs that have been proven safe and effective against human disease and using that knowledge in the design of scaffolds and chemical building blocks for the generation of large numbers of new drug-like compounds.[10]
Locations[edit]
Lexicon operates from two locations found in Texas and New Jersey. The corporate headquarters are in The Woodlands, Texas just north of Houston. This location serves as Lexicon’s primary research facility to discover and validate the company's drug targets and test drug candidates in preclinical research. The company’s clinical development and regulatory team is also based at the corporate headquarters.[11]
Lexicon's campus in Princeton, New Jersey is the home of Lexicon's small molecule medicinal chemistry and preclinical development efforts. This site serves as Lexicon's primary medicinal chemistry site to create new chemical entities for therapeutic development.[11]

Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in discovering and developing breakthrough treatments for human disease. The company was founded in 1995 in The Woodlands, Texas under the name Lexicon Genetics, Incorporated by co-founders Arthur T Sands, Ray B Webb and.[1] The company has used its patented mouse gene knockout technology and extensive in vivo screening capabilities to study nearly 5,000 genes in its Genome5000 program and has identified over 100 potential therapeutic targets. Lexicon has advanced multiple drug candidates into human clinical trials and has a broad and diverse pipeline of drug targets behind its clinical programs. Lexicon is pursuing drug targets in five therapeutic areas including oncology, gastroenterology, immunology, metabolism, and ophthalmology.
The company's clinical drug candidates include sotagliflozin (LX4211) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; LX1033 for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and other gastrointestinal disorders; telotristat ethyl (LX1032) for the treatment of the symptoms associated with carcinoid syndrome; and LX2931 for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Company history[edit]




A Lexicon Genetics knockout mouse (left) that is a model of obesity, compared with a normal mouse.


Lexicon Pharmaceuticals was founded in September 1995 as a biotech venture of Baylor College of Medicine. The company went public in April 2000 with one of the largest initial public offerings in biotech history ($220 million).[2] In June, 2001 Lexicon purchased a privately owned small chemical library synthesis company, Coelacanth Corporation in Princeton, New Jersey,[3] which became the site for the company's small molecule and medicinal chemistry efforts. The company's original name was Lexicon Genetics Incorporated, but in 2007, the name changed to Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to reflect a renewed focus on drug development.
The company initially focused on using gene knockout technology to define the function of genes. This effort complemented and benefited from the international effort to sequence the human and mouse genomes (see Human Genome Project). Using its proprietary gene trapping and gene targeting technologies, the company created the world’s largest repository of genetically modified mouse embryonic stem cells, known as OmniBank, and established a large-scale mammalian knockout program to discover the physiological and behavioral functions of the most druggable mammalian genes.[4] The information collected from this program is stored in the company’s LexVision database, which contains almost 5,000 gene knockouts studied. Over the years, Lexicon evolved from a genomics company into a drug discovery and development company focused on discovering and developing breakthrough treatments for human disease. The company currently has multiple drug candidates in various stages of clinical trials.
Technology[edit]
Lexicon uses patented gene trapping and gene targeting technologies to generate and study knockout mice to discover the physiological and behavioral effects that result from the disruption of a single gene knockout.[5] Because there is a close similarity in gene function and physiology between mice and humans, with a large majority of human genes having a counterpart in the mouse genome,[6] knockout mouse technology has become a powerful tool in the discovery of new medicines.
The value of Lexicon’s technology in drug discovery has been described in a retrospective analysis by the scientific journal Nature. The conclusion of this analysis was that, in most cases, there was a direct correlation when comparing the physiological characteristics, or phenotypes, of knockout mice to the therapeutic effect of the 100 best-selling drugs of 2001.[7] The tremendous utility of knockout mouse technology was recognized in 2007 with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Drs. Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans, and Oliver Smithies.[8]
In developing small molecule drugs for its validated targets, Lexicon uses sophisticated medicinal chemistry known as "click chemistry." Dr. K. Barry Sharpless, who was awarded the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry,[9] pioneered this set of powerful and reliable tools for the rapid synthesis of novel compounds. Lexicon uses solution-phase chemistry to generate diverse libraries of optically pure compounds that are built using highly robust and scalable organic reactions that allow the company to generate compound collections of great diversity and to specially tailor the compound collections to address various therapeutic target families Lexicon’s medicinal chemists design these libraries by analyzing the chemical structures of drugs that have been proven safe and effective against human disease and using that knowledge in the design of scaffolds and chemical building blocks for the generation of large numbers of new drug-like compounds.[10]
Locations[edit]
Lexicon operates from two locations found in Texas and New Jersey. The corporate headquarters are in The Woodlands, Texas just north of Houston. This location serves as Lexicon’s primary research facility to discover and validate the company's drug targets and test drug candidates in preclinical research. The company’s clinical development and regulatory team is also based at the corporate headquarters.[11]
Lexicon's campus in Princeton, New Jersey is the home of Lexicon's small molecule medicinal chemistry and preclinical development efforts. This site serves as Lexicon's primary medicinal chemistry site to create new chemical entities for therapeutic development.[11]

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

THE PROMISE OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.
