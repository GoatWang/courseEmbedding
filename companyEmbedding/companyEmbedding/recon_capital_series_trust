Recon Capital Team Joins Horizons ETFs Management (USA) LLC






November 01, 2016 09:01 PM Eastern Daylight Time



STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Recon Capital Advisors, LLC (“RCA”), the investment adviser to the four 
      exchange-traded funds that make up the Recon Capital Series Trust, has 
      entered into an agreement to be acquired by Horizons ETFs Management 
      (USA) LLC (“Horizons USA”), a member of the Horizons Exchange Traded 
      Funds Group, one of the largest collective families of ETFs in the 
      world. RCA’s team will join Horizons USA, a subsidiary of Mirae Asset 
      Global Investments Co., Ltd.
    

      RCA is an SEC Registered Investment Adviser headquartered in Stamford, 
      CT. The firm serves as investment adviser to Exchange Traded Funds.
    

      Under the terms of the agreement, the members of RCA will join Horizons 
      USA and the four ETFs will continue to be managed by Recon Capital under 
      the Horizons USA name.
    

      The addition of these ETFs to the Horizons USA platform means that 
      Horizons ETFs will offer five US-listed ETFs, representing approximately 
      US $149 million in assets under management (as of September 30, 2016). 
      This family of ETFs includes the Horizons S&P 500® 
      Covered Call ETF, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under 
      the ticker symbol HSPX.
    

      The combined lineup of ETFs is:

      Horizons USA also plans to launch three additional managed risk ETFs 
      that are anticipated to list in Q1 2017 which will focus on Global 
      (ex-USA), Japan and Europe. This is consistent with Horizons USA’s 
      investment philosophy of redefining risk, enhancing yield and 
      diversifying allocations to meet the evolving needs of global investors.
    

“We are very excited to have the Recon Capital team join Horizons 
      ETFs,” said Taeyong Lee, President and Global Head of Mirae Asset 
      Global Investment’s ETF Business. “They have proven expertise in the 
      U.S. ETF market and have extensive insights on how to manage and grow 
      the business in the U.S. As we manage approximately US $11.8 billion in 
      assets under our global ETF business, this new team will be crucial in 
      helping lead the US expansion and contribute to the strong momentum in 
      the growth of our global ETF business.”


      Garrett Paolella, Chief Executive Officer of RCA and Kevin Kelly, the 
      firm’s Chief Investment Officer will join Horizons ETFs as Managing 
      Directors with Troy Cates retaining the role as Head of Trading and 
      Executive Director. Mr. Kelly is a well-known market commentator 
      frequently appearing in both print and television media to discuss both 
      global investment market trends and ETFs.
    

“We are proud to be joining the Horizons USA team,” said Mr. 
      Paolella. “Horizons ETFs has built a solid reputation as an innovator 
      in the global ETF market, and we share this commitment to innovation. 
      The U.S. ETF business is highly competitive, but few ETF providers have 
      the global breadth of product and expertise that Horizons ETFs has, and 
      we think we can leverage that global expertise to dramatically grow our 
      domestic business and build on our successes.”


      The team from RCA will join Horizons USA effective immediately. The 
      transition of the ETFs to Horizons USA is expected to be finalized by Q1 
      2017.

      regular trading day. However, shares of HSPX are not individually 
      redeemable directly from the Funds. Each Fund issues and redeems shares 
      on a continuous basis, at NAV, only in blocks of at least 50,000 shares 
      (“Creation Units”), principally in-kind for securities included in the 
      relevant Index. Recon Funds’ Shares are bought and sold at market price 
      (not NAV), are not individually redeemable, and owners of the Shares may 
      acquire those Shares from the Funds and tender those shares for 
      redemption to the Funds in Creation Unit aggregations only, consisting 
      of 50,000 Shares. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.

Recon Capital Team Joins Horizons ETFs Management (USA) LLC
























STAMFORD, Conn., Nov 01, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Recon Capital Advisors, LLC (“RCA”), the investment adviser to the four 
      exchange-traded funds that make up the Recon Capital Series Trust, has 
      entered into an agreement to be acquired by Horizons ETFs Management 
      (USA) LLC (“Horizons USA”), a member of the Horizons Exchange Traded 
      Funds Group, one of the largest collective families of ETFs in the 
      world. RCA’s team will join Horizons USA, a subsidiary of Mirae Asset 
      Global Investments Co., Ltd.


                                        








RCA is an SEC Registered Investment Adviser headquartered in Stamford, 
      CT. The firm serves as investment adviser to Exchange Traded Funds.


                                        








Under the terms of the agreement, the members of RCA will join Horizons 
      USA and the four ETFs will continue to be managed by Recon Capital under 
      the Horizons USA name.


                                        








The addition of these ETFs to the Horizons USA platform means that 
      Horizons ETFs will offer five US-listed ETFs, representing approximately 
      US $149 million in assets under management (as of September 30, 2016). 
      This family of ETFs includes the Horizons S&P 500
		[®]
	 
      Covered Call ETF, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under 
      the ticker symbol HSPX.

Horizons USA also plans to launch three additional managed risk ETFs 
      that are anticipated to list in Q1 2017 which will focus on Global 
      (ex-USA), Japan and Europe. This is consistent with Horizons USA’s 
      investment philosophy of redefining risk, enhancing yield and 
      diversifying allocations to meet the evolving needs of global investors.


                                        


“We are very excited to have the Recon Capital team join Horizons 
      ETFs,”         
said Taeyong Lee, President and Global Head of Mirae Asset 
      Global Investment’s ETF Business        
. “They have proven expertise in the 
      U.S. ETF market and have extensive insights on how to manage and grow 
      the business in the U.S. As we manage approximately US $11.8 billion in 
      assets under our global ETF business, this new team will be crucial in 
      helping lead the US expansion and contribute to the strong momentum in 
      the growth of our global ETF business.”        









Garrett Paolella, Chief Executive Officer of RCA and Kevin Kelly, the 
      firm’s Chief Investment Officer will join Horizons ETFs as Managing 
      Directors with Troy Cates retaining the role as Head of Trading and 
      Executive Director. Mr. Kelly is a well-known market commentator 
      frequently appearing in both print and television media to discuss both 
      global investment market trends and ETFs.


                                        


“We are proud to be joining the Horizons USA team,”         
said Mr. 
      Paolella.         
“Horizons ETFs has built a solid reputation as an innovator 
      in the global ETF market, and we share this commitment to innovation. 
      The U.S. ETF business is highly competitive, but few ETF providers have 
      the global breadth of product and expertise that Horizons ETFs has, and 
      we think we can leverage that global expertise to dramatically grow our 
      domestic business and build on our successes.”        









The team from RCA will join Horizons USA effective immediately. The 
      transition of the ETFs to Horizons USA is expected to be finalized by Q1 
      2017.

Exchange Traded Fund investing involves risk, including loss of 
      principal.        



Before investing you should carefully consider each Funds’ investment 
      objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is 
      in their respective prospectus which can be found at         


 
      (HSPX) and        


 
      (DAX, QYLD, USMR, &amp; BMLA). Please read the prospectus carefully before 
      you invest. Distributor: Foreside Fund Services, LLC.        



Individual shares of the Horizons-branded exchange traded funds (the 
      “Funds”) may be purchased or sold in the secondary market throughout the 
      regular trading day. However, shares of HSPX are not individually 
      redeemable directly from the Funds. Each Fund issues and redeems shares 
      on a continuous basis, at NAV, only in blocks of at least 50,000 shares 
      (“Creation Units”), principally in-kind for securities included in the 
      relevant Index. Recon Funds’ Shares are bought and sold at market price 
      (not NAV), are not individually redeemable, and owners of the Shares may 
      acquire those Shares from the Funds and tender those shares for 
      redemption to the Funds in Creation Unit aggregations only, consisting 
      of 50,000 Shares. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.

THE MORNINGSTAR RATING™ FOR FUNDS, OR "STAR RATING", IS CALCULATED FOR MANAGED PRODUCTS (INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS, VARIABLE ANNUITY AND VARIABLE LIFE SUBACCOUNTS, EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS, CLOSED-END FUNDS, AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS) WITH AT LEAST A THREE-YEAR HISTORY. EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS AND OPEN-ENDED MUTUAL FUNDS ARE CONSIDERED A SINGLE POPULATION FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES. IT IS CALCULATED BASED ON A MORNINGSTAR RISK-ADJUSTED RETURN MEASURE THAT ACCOUNTS FOR VARIATION IN A MANAGED PRODUCT'S MONTHLY EXCESS PERFORMANCE, PLACING MORE EMPHASIS ON DOWNWARD VARIATIONS AND REWARDING CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE. THE TOP 10% OF PRODUCTS IN EACH PRODUCT CATEGORY RECEIVE 5 STARS, THE NEXT 22.5% RECEIVE 4 STARS, THE NEXT 35% RECEIVE 3 STARS, THE NEXT 22.5% RECEIVE 2 STARS, AND THE BOTTOM 10% RECEIVE 1 STAR. THE OVERALL MORNINGSTAR RATING FOR A MANAGED PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE PERFORMANCE FIGURES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS THREE-, FIVE-, AND 10-YEAR (IF APPLICABLE) MORNINGSTAR RATING METRICS. THE WEIGHTS ARE: 100% THREE-YEAR RATING FOR 36-59 MONTHS OF TOTAL RETURNS, 60% FIVE-YEAR RATING/40% THREE-YEAR RATING FOR 60-119 MONTHS OF TOTAL RETURNS, AND 50% 10-YEAR RATING/30% FIVE-YEAR RATING/20% THREE-YEAR RATING FOR 120 OR MORE MONTHS OF TOTAL RETURNS. WHILE THE 10-YEAR OVERALL STAR RATING FORMULA SEEMS TO GIVE THE MOST WEIGHT TO THE 10-YEAR PERIOD, THE MOST RECENT THREE-YEAR PERIOD ACTUALLY HAS THE GREATEST IMPACT BECAUSE IT IS INCLUDED IN ALL THREE RATING PERIODS. PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE AND IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS.
INDIVIDUAL SHARES OF THE HORIZONS-BRANDED EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS (THE "FUNDS") MAY BE PURCHASED OR SOLD IN THE SECONDARY MARKET THROUGHOUT THE REGULAR TRADING DAY ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE OR NASDAQ EXCHANGE THROUGH A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT. HOWEVER, SHARES ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY REDEEMABLE DIRECTLY FROM THE FUNDS. EACH FUND ISSUES AND REDEEMS SHARES ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS, AT NAV, ONLY IN BLOCKS OF SHARES ("CREATION UNITS"), PRINCIPALLY IN-KIND FOR SECURITIES INCLUDED IN THE RELEVANT INDEX. THE CREATION UNITS FOR BMLA, DAX, QYLD, HSPX and USMR ARE 50,000 SHARES.
BEFORE INVESTING YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FUND'S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES. THIS AND OTHER INFORMATION IS IN THE PROSPECTUS, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED ON THIS WEBSITE. PLEASE READ THE PROSPECTUS CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU INVEST. DISTRIBUTOR: FORESIDE FUND SERVICES, LLC.
THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED WITH INVESTING, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL. CONCENTRATION IN A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR SECTOR WILL SUBJECT THE FUNDS TO LOSS DUE TO ADVERSE OCCURRENCES THAT MAY AFFECT THAT INDUSTRY OR SECTOR. THE FUNDS RISK NOT BENEFITING FROM POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF UNDERLYING SECURITIES ABOVE THE EXERCISE PRICES OF THE WRITTEN COVERED CALL OPTIONS, AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF SUCH SECURITIES. EACH SECTOR FUND IS SUBJECT TO ITS OWN SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS. SEE PROSPECTUS FOR SPECIFIC RISKS REGARDING FUND.
QYLD AND HSPX BOTH ENGAGE IN OPTIONS TRADING. AN OPTION IS A CONTRACT SOLD BY ONE PARTY TO ANOTHER THAT GIVES THE BUYER THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO BUY (CALL) OR SELL (PUT) A STOCK AT AN AGREED UPON PRICE WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD OR ON A SPECIFIC DATE. A COVERED CALL OPTION INVOLVES HOLDING A LONG POSITION IN A PARTICULAR ASSET, IN THIS CASE U.S. COMMON EQUITIES, AND WRITING A CALL OPTION ON THAT SAME ASSET WITH THE GOAL OF REALIZING ADDITIONAL INCOME FROM THE OPTION PREMIUM.
QYLD ENGAGES IN WRITING COVERED CALL INDEX OPTIONS ON THE NASDAQ-100 INDEX. HSPX ENGAGES IN WRITING COVERED CALL INDEX OPTIONS ON OPTION-ELIGIBLE STOCKS IN THE S&P 500® INDEX. BY SELLING COVERED CALL OPTIONS, THE FUND LIMITS ITS OPPORTUNITY TO PROFIT FROM AN INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING INDEX ABOVE THE EXERCISE PRICE, BUT CONTINUES TO BEAR THE RISK OF A DECLINE IN THE INDEX. A LIQUID MARKET MAY NOT EXIST FOR OPTIONS HELD BY THE FUND. WHILE THE FUND RECEIVES PREMIUMS FOR WRITING THE CALL OPTIONS, THE PRICE IT REALIZES FROM THE EXERCISE OF AN OPTION COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE INDICES CURRENT MARKET PRICE.
HORIZONS ETFS MANAGEMENT (US) LLC IS THE INVESTMENT ADVISER OF THE HSPX, BMLA, DAX, QYLD and DAX. THE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED BY FORESIDE FUND SERVICES, LLC, WHICH IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH HORIZONS ETFS MANAGEMENT (US) LLC OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES.
INDEX RETURNS ARE FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY. INVESTORS CANNOT DIRECTLY INVEST IN AN INDEX AND UNMANAGED INDEX RETURNS DO NOT REFLECT ANY MANAGEMENT FEES, TRANSACTION COSTS OR EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS ACTUAL INVESTORS MIGHT HAVE ACHIEVED WOULD HAVE DIFFERED FROM THOSE SHOWN BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING, AMOUNTS OF THEIR INVESTMENTS, AND FEES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS IN THE FUND. PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. INVESTORS IN THE FUND SHOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT A HIGH DEGREE OF VOLATILITY IN THE PRICE OF THE FUND’S SHARES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND INVOLVES A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE OF RISK. INTERNATIONAL INVESTING INVOLVES RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, LIMITED LIQUIDITY, LESS GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SUBSTANTIAL VOLATILITY DUE TO ADVERSE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS. THESE RISKS OFTEN ARE HEIGHTENED FOR INVESTMENTS IN EMERGING/ DEVELOPING MARKETS OR IN CONCENTRATIONS OF SINGLE COUNTRIES. DIVERSIFICATION MAY NOT PROTECT AGAINST MARKET RISK OR LOSS OF PRINCIPAL. BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS WILL REDUCE RETURNS. BMLA, DAX, QYLD AND USMR ARE CONSIDERED NON-DIVERSIFIED AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO GREATER RISKS THAN A DIVERSIFIED FUND.
INVESTING IN USMR INVOLVES RISK, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL. THE FUND SEEKS TO TRACK THE UNDERLYING INDEX, WHICH ITSELF MAY HAVE CONCENTRATION IN CERTAIN REGIONS, ECONOMIES, COUNTRIES, MARKETS, INDUSTRIES OR SECTORS. THE FUND MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO AN INCREASED RISK OR LOSS, INCLUDING LOSSES DUE TO ADVERSE EVENTS THAT AFFECT THE FUND’S INVESTMENTS MORE THAN THE MARKET AS A WHOLE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FUND’S INVESTMENTS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE SECURITIES OF A PARTICULAR ISSUER OR ISSUERS, COUNTRY, GROUP OF COUNTRIES, REGION, MARKET, INDUSTRY, GROUP OF INDUSTRIES, SECTOR, OR ASSET CLASS.

Consensus Ratings for Recon Capital Series Trust Recon Capital FTSE 100 ETF (NYSE:UK) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 6 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.08)Consensus Price Target: $7.88 (61.59% downside)
