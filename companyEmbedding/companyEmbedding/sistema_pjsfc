Sistema PJSFC

Effect on Sistema's debt obligations of injunction

RNS Number : 2152L Sistema PJSFC 17 July 2017  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect on Sistema's debt obligations of injunction
in case brought by Rosneft and Bashneft 
 
Moscow, 17 July 2017 - Sistema PJSFC (hereinafter "Sistema" or "the Corporation") (LSE: SSA, MOEX: AFKS), a publicly traded diversified Russian holding company, announces that as of 17 July 2017, a technical default has occurred on credit obligations of the Corporation amounting to approximately RUB 3.9 billion.
 
The technical default took place due to the ongoing arrest of shares of MTS, Medsi and Bashkirian Power Grid Company owned by the Corporation and Sistema-Invest, which was imposed by the Republic of Bashkortostan Arbitration Court as part of legal proceedings initiated by Rosneft, Bashneft and later joined by the Republic of Bashkortostan (the "Claimants") against Sistema and Sistema-Invest seeking RUB 170.6 billion in damages allegedly incurred by Bahsneft in connection with its reorganisation.
 
Sistema stresses that non-compliance with certain conditions of some of its credit facilities, which triggered the technical default, is driven exclusively by the arrest of the above-mentioned assets and is purely formal in nature. Sistema is servicing its credit and financial obligations in a timely manner and in full, and plans to continue doing so in the future.
 
Sistema believes that the arrest of its assets is unfounded, and continues to take all necessary steps to have the arrest lifted. To this end the Corporation has filed an appeal with the 18th Arbitration Court of Appeal. 
 
Guided by its policy of openness and transparency, Sistema informs shareholders and investors about the progress of the court proceedings on its website: http://www.sistema.com/investoram-i-akcioneram/informacija-ob-iske-k-afk-sistema/.

Sistema PJSFC

Microelectronics JV with Ruselectronics

RNS Number : 4013I Sistema PJSFC 19 June 2017  

 
 
 
Sistema, Ruselectronics to establish a microelectronics JV 
Moscow, 19 June 2017. - Sistema PJSFC (LSE: SSA, MOEX: AFKS), a Russian diversified public holding company, and JSC Ruselectronics, a subsidiary of the state-owned corporation Rostec, announce the signing of a memorandum of understanding on establishing a joint venture in the area of microelectronics (hereinafter, "the JV").
 
The parties will contribute their assets that design, manufacture and certify electronic components to the JV. The final list of assets to be transferred will be determined after the completion of due diligence.
 
Under the shareholder structure, it is planned that Sistema will receive a controlling stake in the JV. Sistema may also attract independent financial investors to the JV during the period it is being formed.
 
The transaction forming the JV is expected to close before the end of Q1 2018.
 
"Sistema has extensive competences in microelectronics. Its subsidiary, Mikron, has Russia's only production based on 180-90-65 nm technology and is conducting research into 45 nm technology. I am confident that the partnership, which will merge the country's leading microelectronic enterprises, will bring Russian microelectronics to a brand new level," said Sistema president Mikhail Shamolin.
 
"Merging assets will help to formulate a single R&D policy in radioelectronics. By doing so we will be able to build a technological chain based on unified principles and technologies, which will enhance efficiency and reduce excessive competition between Sistema and Rostec entities," said Sergey Boev, Deputy Chairman of Sistema's Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of RTI.
 
"The merger of assets has been initiated in accordance with Rostec's strategy aimed at attracting investment partners to companies that ensure the country's technological sovereignty. It will allow pursuing a single research, technological and product strategy, centralising management of R&D programmes, expanding cooperation between enterprises, optimising utilisation rates and increasing operational efficiency," said Grigory Elkin, acting CEO of Ruselectronics.

Detsky Mir Announces IPO Price Range 
 
Moscow, Russia - 26 January 2017 - Sistema PJSFC ("Sistema" or "the Corporation") (LSE: SSA; MOEX: AFKS), a Russian public diversified holding company, notes that its subsidiary, PJSC Detsky Mir ("the Company" and, together with its subsidiaries, "Detsky Mir") has announced the price range for its initial public offering (the "Offering") of ordinary shares (the "Shares"). Sistema plans to participate in the Offering as a selling shareholder, and retain a controlling stake in the Company following completion of the Offering.
 

The price range for the Offering has been set at between RUB 85 and RUB 105 per Share.
The Selling Shareholders are expected to sell a total of up to 247.9 million Shares, including the over-allotment option, which based on the announced price range would represent an Offering size of between RUB 21.1 billion and RUB 26.0 billion, valuing the Company at between RUB 62.8 billion and RUB 77.6 billion.
The full text of Detsky Mir's announcement with further details on the Offering is available at corp.detmir.ru/en/

 
Sistema President Mikhail Shamolin said: "We believe that the price range reflects Detsky Mir's strong business model, solid track record and significant potential for further profitable growth. Detsky Mir's IPO represents the first opportunity for a broad pool of investors to gain exposure to a uniquely attractive asset that is growing faster and delivering higher returns than other companies in the Russian retail universe. We continue to believe Detsky Mir has significant growth opportunities, which is a major reason why Sistema will retain a controlling stake in the Company following completion of the Offering, while offering new investors the opportunity to share in the potential upside."
