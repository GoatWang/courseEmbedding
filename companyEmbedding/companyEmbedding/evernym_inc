 The identity revolution starts now.Digital identity today is fundamentally and irreparably flawed. Our technology permanently corrects course on “siloed” identity,  a crisis of trust that costs the global economy trillions each year.
Rethinking identityfrom the ground up.Why did we invent, build, and open source an entirely new distributed ledger that’s engineered for the sole purpose of identity? That’s easy. It’s the only way to finally do identity right.
Digital identity today is entirely “siloed.” It forces every organization to become identity (and security) experts in order to know who (or what) they’re actually interacting with, both online and off. Managing many identities is not only an expensive hassle for organizations, it’s aggravating for people and a security nightmare for the Internet of Things, too. 
Evernym has developed the world’s first publicly available distributed ledger dedicated to solving this problem – Sovrin – and we’ve donated its code to Hyperledger (project Indy), making it available for everyone, everywhere.
Read the White Papers (PDF)Built for TrustInstantly and accurately verify the authenticity of claims made by any person, organization, or thing, without centralized databases.
Built for PrivacySimply the most powerful, privacy-preserving technology in existence. It’s time privacy made a comeback.
Built for InteroperabilityEngineered for universal compatibility with both legacy and ledger-based identity protocols. 
We're working withsome incredible folksHomeland SecurityEvernym is currently researching, designing and building a Decentralized Key Management System (DKMS) under an SBIR research grant from the  U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate.
CU LedgerFor CULedger – a national consortium representing the U.S. Credit Union industry – we’ll  dramatically reduce fraud, increase security, and simplify compliance,  all while improving the member experience.
iRespondGlobal nonprofit iRespond is partnering with Evernym for privacy-respecting biometric identification for at-risk populations across the globe.
Financial Services LeaderThis Fortune 500 financial services company believes their 10 million customers should own their own identity, and is working with us to accomplish exactly that. 
Healthcare InitiativeEvernym is partnering on a nationwide initiative to provide all UK doctors with a digital passport and reputation system.
Global Financial Services LeaderThis multi-national leader in the financial services industry with 40 million customers tapped Evernym to simplify compliance while improving customer experience.
