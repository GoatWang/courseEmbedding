Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]
Clarified Networks provides a wide set of different situation awareness tools,[60] including:
Virtual Situation Room (VSRoom) provides unified, real-time views to the information provided by your monitoring systems. With VSRoom you will be able to collect, visualize and share monitoring data collected from your critical infrastructure. It provides beautiful situation overviews of complex data for decision makers and first line operation centers.
AbuseHelper is an open framework for collecting and sharing intelligence on suspected malicious activity. Clarified Networks is the lead developer and community contributor of AbuseHelper.
Network Analyzer is the tool of choice for collaborative analysis and visualization of complex networks. The analyzer helps you in collaborative troubleshooting, traffic audits and network documentation based on real traffic.
History[edit]
The research and development for Clarified Networks' tools began in 2002 and continued for four years in the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) before Clarified Networks spun off from the research group in 2006.
The company entered the Venture Cup competition that year, and was one of the finalists.[61]
In 2007, the founders of Clarified Networks also were awarded for their VMware Applicance called HowNetWorks.[62][63]

Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]

Network Analyzer is the tool of choice for collaborative analysis and visualization of complex networks. The analyzer helps you in collaborative troubleshooting, traffic audits and network documentation based on real traffic.
History[edit]
The research and development for Clarified Networks' tools began in 2002 and continued for four years in the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) before Clarified Networks spun off from the research group in 2006.
The company entered the Venture Cup competition that year, and was one of the finalists.[61]
In 2007, the founders of Clarified Networks also were awarded for their VMware Applicance called HowNetWorks.[62][63]

Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Avanti Corporation[edit]
Avanti Corporation (the 'i' in "Avanti" is upside down, so it is also often seen as Avant!) was an electronic design automation company, purchased by Synopsys in 2002 (see wikt:avanti for the meaning of the word).
Clarified Networks[edit]
Clarified Networks is a company that is headquartered in Oulu, Finland. The company was acquired by Codenomicon in 2011, but continues to operate as a separate company under the Codenomicon Group.[57]
The company is most famous for producing visualizations of security incidents, for example the patching of DNS cache poisoning attacks[58] and Botnet[59] traffic.
Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]
Clarified Networks provides a wide set of different situation awareness tools,[60] including:
Virtual Situation Room (VSRoom) provides unified, real-time views to the information provided by your monitoring systems. With VSRoom you will be able to collect, visualize and share monitoring data collected from your critical infrastructure. It provides beautiful situation overviews of complex data for decision makers and first line operation centers.
AbuseHelper is an open framework for collecting and sharing intelligence on suspected malicious activity. Clarified Networks is the lead developer and community contributor of AbuseHelper.
Network Analyzer is the tool of choice for collaborative analysis and visualization of complex networks. The analyzer helps you in collaborative troubleshooting, traffic audits and network documentation based on real traffic.
History[edit]
The research and development for Clarified Networks' tools began in 2002 and continued for four years in the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) before Clarified Networks spun off from the research group in 2006.
The company entered the Venture Cup competition that year, and was one of the finalists.[61]
In 2007, the founders of Clarified Networks also were awarded for their VMware Applicance called HowNetWorks.[62][63]
In 2011, Company was acquired by Codenomicon.

Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Avanti Corporation[edit]
Avanti Corporation (the 'i' in "Avanti" is upside down, so it is also often seen as Avant!) was an electronic design automation company, purchased by Synopsys in 2002 (see wikt:avanti for the meaning of the word).
Clarified Networks[edit]
Clarified Networks is a company that is headquartered in Oulu, Finland. The company was acquired by Codenomicon in 2011, but continues to operate as a separate company under the Codenomicon Group.[57]
The company is most famous for producing visualizations of security incidents, for example the patching of DNS cache poisoning attacks[58] and Botnet[59] traffic.
Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]
Clarified Networks provides a wide set of different situation awareness tools,[60] including:
Virtual Situation Room (VSRoom) provides unified, real-time views to the information provided by your monitoring systems. With VSRoom you will be able to collect, visualize and share monitoring data collected from your critical infrastructure. It provides beautiful situation overviews of complex data for decision makers and first line operation centers.
AbuseHelper is an open framework for collecting and sharing intelligence on suspected malicious activity. Clarified Networks is the lead developer and community contributor of AbuseHelper.
Network Analyzer is the tool of choice for collaborative analysis and visualization of complex networks. The analyzer helps you in collaborative troubleshooting, traffic audits and network documentation based on real traffic.
History[edit]
The research and development for Clarified Networks' tools began in 2002 and continued for four years in the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) before Clarified Networks spun off from the research group in 2006.
The company entered the Venture Cup competition that year, and was one of the finalists.[61]
In 2007, the founders of Clarified Networks also were awarded for their VMware Applicance called HowNetWorks.[62][63]
In 2011, Company was acquired by Codenomicon.

Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Avanti Corporation[edit]
Avanti Corporation (the 'i' in "Avanti" is upside down, so it is also often seen as Avant!) was an electronic design automation company, purchased by Synopsys in 2002 (see wikt:avanti for the meaning of the word).
Clarified Networks[edit]
Clarified Networks is a company that is headquartered in Oulu, Finland. The company was acquired by Codenomicon in 2011, but continues to operate as a separate company under the Codenomicon Group.[57]
The company is most famous for producing visualizations of security incidents, for example the patching of DNS cache poisoning attacks[58] and Botnet[59] traffic.
Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]
Clarified Networks provides a wide set of different situation awareness tools,[60] including:
Virtual Situation Room (VSRoom) provides unified, real-time views to the information provided by your monitoring systems. With VSRoom you will be able to collect, visualize and share monitoring data collected from your critical infrastructure. It provides beautiful situation overviews of complex data for decision makers and first line operation centers.
AbuseHelper is an open framework for collecting and sharing intelligence on suspected malicious activity. Clarified Networks is the lead developer and community contributor of AbuseHelper.
Network Analyzer is the tool of choice for collaborative analysis and visualization of complex networks. The analyzer helps you in collaborative troubleshooting, traffic audits and network documentation based on real traffic.
History[edit]
The research and development for Clarified Networks' tools began in 2002 and continued for four years in the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) before Clarified Networks spun off from the research group in 2006.
The company entered the Venture Cup competition that year, and was one of the finalists.[61]
In 2007, the founders of Clarified Networks also were awarded for their VMware Applicance called HowNetWorks.[62][63]
In 2011, Company was acquired by Codenomicon.

Novas Software (often referred to as "Novas") was a company founded in 1996 by Dr. Paul Huang to address the ongoing problem of debugging chip designs. Novas was purchased by Taiwan-based EDA company SpringSoft in May 2008. Prior to its purchase, Novas was partly owned by SpringSoft, which developed the underlying debug technology.[69] Until 2008, Novas grew to employ over 50 people with office locations across the world, headquartered in San Jose, California. SpringSoft and Novas was acquired by Synopsys in 2012.
Novas offered debugging and visibility enhancement products that cut down on verification time. Novas' main product offerings included the Debussy Debug System, Verdi Automated Debug System and the Siloti family of Visibility Enhancement products. A 2006 study found Novas Software to be the sixth most-used EDA vendor.[70] Along with this, Novas Software topped the user satisfaction ratings with 100% of respondents in Europe, 83% in North America & 69% in Asia saying they were either "very" or "somewhat" satisfied.[71] This distinction was also awarded to Novas Software for the four years prior to 2006.

Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software.

Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
