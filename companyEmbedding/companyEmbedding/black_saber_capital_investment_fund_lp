How PE funds can overstate LP returns by up to 50 pct

Continue reading on PE HUB
 writes: 


















 


By Thomas Krenik, Harvey Powers, and Kelley Rytlewski 
Private equity funds are the widely accepted investment strategy for pensions, endowments, family offices and other investors to access the private markets. But the reported returns of PE funds are misleading, representing only a partial view of the capital involved.
Typically, PE fund returns are shown for deployed capital, which can persuade limited partners that a fund’s returns are higher than reality  — as much as 50 percent higher in fact. By carefully considering a fund investment from an LP’s perspective, we can first understand what reported returns do mean and then build a more holistic picture to appreciate the overstatement.
Sitting on the LP side of the table, what does it mean to invest in a PE fund? Legally, an investor will sign a limited-partnership-agreement stating their obligation to provide capital for future investments. A large figure is committed to the fund up front and an LP naturally treats that commitment as a portfolio allocation to private equity.
In return, according to Preqin’s 2016 PE Report, the top quartile of funds deliver a 22 percent IRR (and what fund admits to being outside the top quartile?).
Two inaccuracies with this 22 percent number exist: one an assumption and the other an omission.
The assumption is, as Harvard Business Review points out, the IRR is calculated on a cash-flow basis[1] . With that analysis, reported IRRs imply that cash distributions from selling investments are reinvested at the same IRR over the entire investment period. That’s untrue unless LPs can immediately deploy capital from PE investments into equally profitable opportunities as funds are distributed. 





The omission — a piece missing entirely from funds’ calculations — is the hidden but considerable opportunity cost of committed capital.
Committed capital: the amount of money a limited partner dedicates to a fund, which is deployed over several years as investments are identified.
Funds structured with capital commitments are dubbed blind pools because investors commit into a fund without knowing exactly where the money will be invested. The general partner will raise a fund, essentially securing dry powder to fuel future investments, and then will go out and source the exact deals over many years with the money close at hand.
When a new investment into the fund is secured, the GP sends LPs a capital call, which requires delivery of their share of capital, typically within five to 10 business days. LPs invested in PE funds must maintain highly liquid and stable-value assets to respond to capital calls on such short notice. Such funds are typically held in low-yielding Treasurys, corporate bonds and liquid fixed-income index funds.
While on standby, uncalled committed capital takes a double hit: (i) paying full management fees and (ii) losing the excess returns expected from a PE allocation.
So how should an LP break down the 22 percent number and get to reality?
Expected View: A compounding black box
If the reported returns met our expectations at face value, we could think of PE investing as something quite simple: a compounding black box. Money would go in, time would pass, and then more money would come out, with net returns equal to 22 percent IRR on everything we put in. 





Let’s draw out that logic over a typical fund lifespan of 12 years (Palico) and scale down our initial investment to a single Benjamin[2]. At time zero, $100 goes in. It works for 12 years, making 22 percent each year, and boom — we should get $1,087 at the end of the party. Right?

If only it were so simple. Unfortunately, most investors quickly learn that their money does not go in all at once, nor it is distributed in one lump sum.
Inside View: How a 22 percent fund IRR really works
We can modify our thinking to illustrate how a $100 investment is actually deployed piecewise over the investment period, which is typically seven years (Terms of Private Equity Funds)[3]. When the investment period expires, not all of our money was even deployed. 





Based on Preqin data for the average deployment schedule, funds actually invest around 94 percent of committed capital and the rest is released at the end of the investment period (a little troublesome since those dollars paid fees while waiting)[4]. Which reminds us that we have to include management fees as an additional outflow. During the investment period, fees are generally highest, at 2 percent of committed capital and drop to around 1 percent of invested capital for the remaining years.
The impact of full fees siphoned from large amounts of undrawn capital makes the fee drag particularly steep at the outset, amplifying what investors call the J-curve.
J-Curve: a shorthand to describe an LP’s returns when investing in funds. Initially, capital calls and management fees are negative cash flows before portfolio-company exits bring positive cash-flow distributions in later years.
Now, for the good part: distributions. We can expect distributions to start after year 5 and continue until the end of the fund. Following historical aggregated fund numbers, we can translate a distribution schedule into dollar amounts. In our assumptions, deals last five years and distributions are shown after performance fees, calculated using a standard 20 percent carried interest and 8 percent hurdle rate.
If you were thinking of a PE fund as a black box, the results under this new picture are painful. While our IRR remained 22 percent, instead of the $1,087 output we expected, we’re only getting $285. But funds aren’t lying about their IRRs. So what happened? 






Well, the time that our money spent deployed in the box decreased from our original thinking. Instead of all of it spending the full 12 years deployed, our dollars were deployed piece by piece over seven years and exited five years after they went to work. The cash inflows and outflows at their respective times equal a 22 percent IRR after fees, but now we are much less pleased.
This reveals how most funds can report fantastic returns on deployed capital. The method is equivalent to a hedge fund storing most of its assets in cash and measuring its performance only on capital active in the market. It fails to provide a holistic picture of the manager’s AUM performance.
By viewing only the dollars going directly in and directly out of a fund, we can be fooled into thinking this models the return on our initial investment. The crisp Benjamin we first put onto the table gave up better opportunities for returns to sit and wait as dry powder for the fund manager. The cost of this committed-but-uncalled allocation must be appropriately tracked from time zero — not when it was deployed but when it was set aside as committed capital. 





Enlightened View: Accounting for the opportunity cost of committed capital
Committed capital creates a significant short-term liability and LPs need to hold highly liquid stable assets to meet capital calls on short notice. Consequently, LPs typically increase holdings in liquid fixed-income assets, which optimistically generate a 2 percent to 3 percent IRR (essentially offsetting management fees but little more).
Maintaining liquidity for committed capital is required to support a PE fund investment. As a result, we must include the opportunity cost in the fund return equation. To incorporate committed capital, we immediately invest our committed capital in highly liquid stable assets. These assets distribute 3 percent annually, and after seven years (the investment period), our remaining committed capital is released.
Once we include all of the boxes that our capital is in for a fund investment, our actual IRR returns are much, much lower. Here’s the second revelation: Our total dollars out actually increased slightly with an additional $9 earned on committed-but-uncalled capital, to $294 from $285 ­ —  but because we are now including committed capital as an investment active on the table, our IRR decreases to 14.2% from 22%!
Remember, IRRs are calculated based on cash flows in and out. Funds don’t consider dollars ‘in’ until they are deployed. Investors must consider their dollars ‘in’ when they are committed, as their liability to the fund is immediately moved into liquid holdings earning minimal returns. Time ticking against that idle capital lowers the IRR of a fund investment dramatically. 






Investors need to be mindful of this reality. Reported fund returns can overstate the truth by ignoring the effects of committed capital — a sleight of hand that can inflate the real number by 50 percent or more.
Outside the largest institutions in the world, few investors can mitigate the costs of committed capital. All investors in PE funds need to be aware that their returns are not as advertised. The PE asset class still performs incredibly well when compared with peers, but the fund structure is a far cry from a compounding black box.

Black Canyon Business Park, Phoenix
Irvine, Calif.—Going, going, gone. The ship has sailed for any investors interested in BKM Capital Partners‘ inaugural investment vehicle, as the institutional fund manager recently wrapped up the final close of BKM Industrial Value Fund I LP.  The $105 million in equity commitments provides the fund with a leveraged total of $300 million for the acquisition of multi-tenant, value-add industrial assets.
It wasn’t just institutional investors that took a liking to Fund I, which launched in 2014; a small group of high net worth investors participated as well. BKM reeled them in with a different approach. The company opted to invest its own capital to finance the amassing of a crackerjack team in advance of  raising funds. Additionally, BKM raised seed money through a friends and family round, which resulted in a $100 million budget for acquisitions. “Through this strategy, we were able to demonstrate to our larger institutional investors that we can successfully acquire and generate value with our focused niche, and that it can be scaled,” Brian Malliet, co-founder & CEO of BKM, said in a prepared statement.
To date, Fund I has invested approximately $117 million in assets totaling nearly 1.2 million square feet. Purchases include the 223,000-square-foot Patrick Commerce Center in Las Vegas; the 98,500-square-foot Hayden Island Business Park in Portland; and Black Canyon Business Park, a property in Phoenix featuring 219,400 square feet. In line with its value proposition, BKM repositioned the underperforming assets, boosting their income and value.
“This value-add strategy, coupled with our ability to execute, was a major driver of investor interest during the fundraise period,” Malliet added. Fund I calls for a five-year hold period for the properties. In the meantime, the investment vehicle has money to spend, which it plans to do in its target region: the Western U.S. The focus is on metropolitan markets in California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona and Utah; however, California, Oregon and Washington are highest on the radar.

Mutual funds can help lower investing risks
Take some of the anxiety out of investing by letting a mutual fund do a little of the work for you.



EXPLORE ALL OUR MUTUAL FUNDS
Get a complete portfolio in one fund

Review a short list of Vanguard Select Funds™

Browse Vanguard funds by asset class


Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!
Learn more about The Vanguard Effect™


How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

footnote*Vanguard average mutual fund expense ratio: 0.12%. Industry average expense ratio: 0.69%. All averages are asset-weighted. Industry averages exclude Vanguard. Sources: Vanguard and Morningstar, Inc., as of December 31, 2016.
footnote**For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 9 of 9 Vanguard money market funds, 51 of 54 Vanguard bond funds, 23 of 23 Vanguard balanced funds, and 99 of 107 Vanguard stock funds—for a total of 182 of 193 Vanguard funds—outperformed their Lipper peer-group average. Results will vary for other time periods. Only mutual funds with a minimum 10-year history were included in the comparison. Source: Lipper, a Thomson Reuters Company.

footnote***The "Money 50" list published in the January/February 2017 Investor's Guide of Money magazine is based on mutual funds and ETFs that are low-cost and produce long-term returns that match or beat their benchmarks. Past performance cannot be used to predict future returns. Fund share prices will fluctuate, so investors could lose money if they sell when prices have fallen.
You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
