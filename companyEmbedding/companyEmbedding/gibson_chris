Chris Cornell ES-335

Known for his singing, songwriting, and guitar playing with groundbreaking Seattle grungers Soundgarden as well as his solo work and his contribution to later bands like Audioslave and Temple Of The Dog, Chris Cornell has been a major creative force in alternative music since the mid 1980s. In addition to his powerful four-octave vocal range, Cornell is a distinguished guitarist, and has long shown a love of Gibson electrics with some alternative twists. 

The Chris Cornell ES-335 from Gibson’s Memphis division captures Cornell-certified looks and appointments in a great new ES-335 built with full Gibson quality and tradition behind it. The legendary and original thinline semi-hollow electric is given a clever tweak with a pair of Jason Lollar™ Lollartron® pickups, for that fat-but-jangly late ’50s to early ’60s humbucker-fired twang that fuels Chris Cornell’s tone. Your choice of an Olive Drab Green or Flat Black finish in nitrocellulose lacquer, with a Bigsby™ vibrato option on the former, extends the individuality of this unique artist’s model. From its superbly original tones to its stunningly distinctive looks, the Chris Cornell ES-335 is a powerful new performer from Gibson Memphis.   


Body and Neck 
The Chris Cornell ES-335 is constructed in the image of the original “dot neck” 335s of the late 1950s, with a semi-hollow body made from laminated maple with a bound top and back and a solid maple center block. The result is the perfect marriage of the traditional archtop’s looks and sonic depth, and the solidbody’s sustain and resistance to feedback. The neck is made from solid mahogany, and topped with a bound fingerboard made from hand-selected rosewood, inlaid with simple pearloid dot position markers, while the headstock carries a mother-of-pearl Gibson logo and crown inlay. 


Pickups and Electronics  
While continuing in the ES-335’s humbucker tradition, the Chris Cornell ES-335 departs from the norm with a pair of Jason Lollar™ Lollartrons®, made in the style of the original Filter’Tron® humbuckers of the late ’50s and early ’60s for a distinctively twangy tone, but sized for a Gibson PAF-style humbucker mounting. The result is plenty of tonal depth and warmth from the semi-hollow design, but with a new clarity and crispness from the Lollartron® pickups, with excellent hum rejection. The pickups are routed through the traditional three-way switch and individual volume and tone controls and topped with clear knobs for a distinctive look.


Hardware 
The Flat Black model carries Gibson’s legendary Tune-o-matic bridge with aluminum stopbar tailpiece, and there’s a Bigsby™ option on the Olive Drab Green model. Both renditions are equipped with high-quality Grover™ Rotomatic® tuners. All hardware is treated to Gibson’s proprietary VOS process for a gently aged vintage look.

 
Every Chris Cornell ES-335 comes protected in a black leatherette hardshell case with plush charcoal lining, and includes a Certificate of Authenticity, owner’s manual, and coverage by Gibson’s Limited Lifetime Warranty and 24/7/365 customer service.

Lovies guitars is offering up an absolutely ripping 2012 Gibson Chris Cornell ES-335 Signature Electric Semi-Hollow Body Guitar in Flat Black finish!! This is the real deal! So gorgeous and so cool! Gibson has a one of a kind style and this Chris does it right! Great sound and great condition makes this guitar a GREAT deal! Guitar does have a few mods. Hence the huge savings. This guitar has been fitted with smoking PAF bare Knuckle Mule pickups ($375). Really just smoked the Lollartrons in my opinion. Just rich full and full. Also fitted with a coil split switch for each pickup. Really great tonal possibility here. I could not put this guitar down when testing it. It was done up really nice for someone who want a killer sounding guitar, not so much a collectors guitar anymore. has several scratches and a few small dings. No COA. Please see photos below. This guitar has an awesome vibe! Makes you want to plug it in and just get carried away by the sweet tunes. Really versatile and rich guitar. SEE many images below!!  Includes original Gibson Custom Chris Cornell Hard Case. 
WEIGHS in at: 8 lbs. 12 oz.
From Gibson: (note changes above)
Thank Chris Cornell for This Very Special ES-335
The Gibson Memphis Chris Cornell ES-335 semi-hollowbody electric guitar lets you create your own signature tones, and look good doing it. It’s made in Memphis, TN to embody the aggressive style of Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell, and packs a pair of LollarTron humbuckings pickups ready to make your amplifier purr, sing, or scream. The iconic look of the Chris Cornell ES-335 is enhanced by VOS hardware and custom clear knobs, without dial indicators. Take a look at the photos in Sweetwater’s Guitar Gallery, and you’ll see the Gibson Memphis Chris Cornell ES-335 is a very special semi-hollowbody.
A signature ES-335 for Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell
Chris Cornell certainly did more than his part in defining the sound of ’90s alternative rock tone and beyond. From aggressive, raw, overdriven rhythms to disorienting, vibrato-laced clean lines, Chris Cornell’s playing with both Soundgarden and Audioslave set new standards for distinctive guitar tones. The ES-335 has always been loved by a wide variety of musicians, and this Chris Cornell ES-335 is primed for easy playability and wide-ranging tone that transcends any one genre.
Gibson Memphis Chris Cornell ES-335 Semi-hollowbody Electric Guitar Features:
