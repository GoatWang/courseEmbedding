         			 		Welcome to Illinois Products Corporation        				


 





Illinois Products Corporation makes specialty items for brick and concrete masonry construction. Our products are designed to improve the quality of the structure and make the mason's job easier.
In the 1960's we pioneered the concept of correctly proportioning dry powder in plastic bags for accelerating the set of winter mortar. We were the first to produce patented pre-formed flashing corners, pre-formed flashing end dams, and stainless steel drip edges in the late 1980's.
Our objective has never been to have the broadest product line – we strive to make ours the best.

What People Are Saying




"DDC is truly the premier course of its kind and owes much of its success to those who developed this program and to those who continue to improve and strengthen it for the current and future driving public.  It has been my pleasure to work alongside the people of IISC and NSC who have assisted me in providing this outstanding traffic safety presentation."
Doug Sommer, Safety Educator - Sommer's Safety Sessions - Pekin, IL





"The Iowa-Illinois Safety Council connects members with some of the best in the environmental, health and safety industry in the state of Iowa.  Through my membership I've been introduced to other EHS professionals and have learned from them and from the Council.  I'm able to better understand the challenges of regulations and the effect laws can have on employees and organizations.  And I can apply this knowledge to the organization where I work."
Nicole Crane, Safety Training Specialist - Iowa Association of Business & Industry - Des Moines, IA





"I've attended most of the annual professional development conferences since I entered the safety field 25 years ago.   I've used trainers from the IISC staff for presentations and outside expertise, and they have been well-received and have represented the Council professionally."
Pete Visser, Safety Manager - Winnebago Industries - Forest City, IA
