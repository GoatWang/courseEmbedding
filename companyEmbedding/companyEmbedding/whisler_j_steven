J. Steven Whisler
2004 Inductee into American Mining Hall of Fame
J. Steven Whisler was born in 1954 and was raised in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He holds a B.S. degree in business (accounting) from the University of Colorado, a J.D. degree from the University of Denver College of Law, and an M.S. degree in mineral economics and an honorary D. Sc. degree in engineering from the Colorado School of Mines. Mr. Whisler also attended the Harvard Business School’s Advanced Management Program. He is admitted to the bar of the State of Colorado, various federal courts, and the United States Supreme Court. He is a Certified Public Accountant in the State of Arizona. Steve joined Phelps Dodge’s corporate office in New York in 1981. Since then, he has served as counsel for the company’s exploration group, as president of the Mining Company, as president and chief operating officer of the Phelps Dodge Corporation, and currently as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Steve has been instrumental in rebuilding Phelps Dodge. His career at Phelps Dodge has established him as a mining industry leader. Throughout his career, he has been passionate about safety with his declaration that Phelps Dodge is morally obligated to ensure that no employee will be harmed in the process of producing PD products. To this end, he has developed a program called "Zero and Beyond" in which no goal other than zero occupational illness and workplace injuries is acceptable at Phelps Dodge. Steve’s other major initiative within PD, called "Quest for Zero", is a performance system for creating sustainable operational improvements by achieving zero environmental incidents, zero variability in production processes and costs, zero waste, and zero product defects.
Mr. Whisler is a director of the Phelps Dodge Corporation in Phoenix, Arizona, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation in Fort Worth, Texas, the America West Holdings Corporation and its principal subsidiary, America West Airlines, Inc. in Tempe, Arizona, the National Mining Association in Washington, D. C., the International Copper Association in New York, New York, and the Copper Development Association in New York, New York. He is also a member of the Business Council. Mr. Whisler is a member of the Colorado Bar Association, Arizona Society of CPAs, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, and the Mining and Metallurgical Society of America. Mr. Whisler has been awarded the Colorado School of Mines "Distinguished Achievement Medal" for career accomplishments.Print Version     Previous     Archive     Next

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
