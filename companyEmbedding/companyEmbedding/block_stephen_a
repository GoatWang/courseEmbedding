Product Description▼▲
Discover how freedom from poor choices is possible. You don't have to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. In Walking Into Walls, Stephen Arterburn identifies five reasons why we make bad decisions--stubborn resistance, self-centered entitlement, justifiable resentment, blind ignorance, and disconnected isolation; and leads you through the process of deconstructing walls to find permanent healing through humble willingness to change. Includes a study guide for individual or group reflection.

            I didn't know what to first expect, when I started reading, "Walking into Walls:5 Blind Spots that Block God's Work in You".


Was it self-help?


Is it a motivational?


What blind spots are we even talking about, but as I begun to read through Stephen Arterburn's book, I was impressed by, not just the style of writing, which was very laid back and conversational (always a good thing), but although this, like any book, is never a substitute for actual, face to face therapy, that is beneficial to work through whatever is on one's heart, "Walking into Walls:5 Blind Spots that Block God's Work in You", really helps begin the first steps toward identifying the walls, that we can put up in our lives, that not only hinder a productive, healthy living and relationships in our lives, but can also hinder our walk with God.


Now, does any of this sound like part of us, or all of us:


1. Stubborn resistance, and/or


2. Arrogant entitlement, and/or


3. Justifiable resentment, and/or


4. Disconnected isolation, and/or


5, Blind ignorance.


Maybe.....maybe not.


"Walking into Walls:5 Blind Spots that Block God's Work in You" isn't a book that is either condemning or difficult.


The reality is that , we all have, currently or may experience at some point in our lives,one or all of these blind spots and what Stephen Arterburn, does, is with gentle guidance, encouraging anecdotes that help us see how these "walls" can blind us without knowing and even understanding through Scripture, really helps the reader, no matter how small or big the circumstances in their lives, deal with these walls, that we put up in our lives.


Currently the book is available in hardback and there is a study guide for readers to work at their own pace or with a study group and readers will find, that the book is very easy reading, yet conveys a very powerful message that we don't have to be held back by past experiences that contribute to the walls and blind spots that we carry into our present and sometimes into our futures.


I like the illustrations that Stephen Arterburn makes, blending both scripture and pop culture that really helps us identify with the examples he conveys about the walls that are built up and with them, the blind spots that can keep us from seeing what holds us captive and at the same time allowing God to do the dynamic work, HE wants to do with us and give us the future He has planned.


As shared, I started this book out with hesitation, due to, it's easy to try to offer easy solutions that are not often applicable to hard situations, and "Walking Into Walls" doesn't do this, nor does this promise to "fix your life, your car, your relationships", but instead is about getting to the beginning steps that are needed to move forward in one's life.


The interesting thing is that, there is a realization that we all carry walls and blind spots in our lives, that either we maybe aware of or just try to conveniently ignore and with the writing style of Stephen Arterburn, he really helps break down ways we can discover those walls and blind spots without it being a "log confrontation".


The reading, is in itself, just a 135 pages with the study guide that is included, taking up a good half of the other book, but from the study guide itself, its both a mixture of using Scripture for reference and growth as a Christian, and self-discovery at the same time.


The book makes then, for not only a good personal time reading, but when read in a group study, a great character growth journey, with others who may feel like they are "stuck" in the same patterns.


It really opens up to questions we may have about feeling insecure, maybe dealing with past issues, just being brave to take on new directions in life.


For all the hesitations I had going into the book initially, I came out of it, really finding this to be, for a "short book", very impressive. It's very impressive, because there are "things" in all of us, that we can work on....not to be perfect, which is not possible or even healthy to try to attain, but so we can keep moving forward into having positive, healthy relationships and lives.


Stephen Arterburn's writing is emotional; He writes to connect with the reader and to speak directly to them and he definitely achieves that in, "Walking Into Walls", while at the same time, you get that feeling of, "Oh wow, he does get it", which many of times, there are those who do need to just hear that, not to be fixed or lectured, but to know....people do understand and the book achieves it on that level.


On another level, "Walking into Walls" helps bring a better understanding of how our experiences can both help and also hinder us and how to not let it become traps that keeps us in a bondage of bitterness,denial, lies and blindness that affects all areas of our lives and how we interact with other people and just how it can affect our own journeys.


The steps that are provided, are very practical and down to earth. Stephen Arterburn doesn't share anything that would seem impossible,but rather very plausible and workable.


So, overall, "Walking Into Walls" is great reading really for anyone who finds themselves feeling stagnant in their lives, or maybe finding themselves, either physically or mentally repeating unhealthy habits and actions that are keeping them from moving forward.

            Do you long for a life of freedom? Do you think that circumstances beyond your control should continue to sabotage your life long after you've moved on? Do you continue to make poor choices out of stubborn resistance, self-centered entitlement, justifiable resentment, blind ignorance and disconnected isolation?


Arterburn walks us through the five prison walls that keep us from living the life we've always wantedÃ¢â¬âa life of confidence and joy. If you are stuck in a dark place, Arterburn's advice in "Walking Into Walls" will help you get unstuck and help you distinguish between walls and personal boundaries.


An excellent resource for Christian counselors, "Walking Into Walls" also contains an interactive study guide and online content designed to help conquer self-defeating behavior, reactions and attitudes and make permanent changes that can affect your life and the lives of those around you permanently.


The main ingredient in Arterburn's advice in this book is honesty and willingness to deal with the issues that have built these prison walls in the first place. The study guide will walk you through the steps to take to foster healing. It is designed for personal study or as a tool between the reader and a trusted confidante, mentor or counselor.

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                 By Caitlin Gibson  By Caitlin Gibson   June 13  Follow @caitjgibson       Stephen King in Paris in 2013.  (Francois Mori/AP)  — It doesn’t take much to provoke President Trump into blocking a follower on Twitter — anything from an insult to an unflattering GIF to a mild “covfefe” joke seems enough to do the trick. So it perhaps shouldn’t come as a surprise that best-selling author Stephen King was abruptly added to the #BlockedByTrump list Tuesday. The horror fiction maestro has been one of Trump’s most consistent and creative Twitter critics since well before the November election: “A Trump presidency scares me more than anything else,” he told Ron Charles, editor of The Washington Post’s Book World, during a Facebook Live interview in September. “I’m terrified that he’ll become president.”   [Stephen King trolls Trump’s wiretapping tweets as only a horror writer could]   Trump, of course, did exactly that — and King continued to offer outspoken condemnation (and sometimes, outright mockery) in response to Trump’s Twitter missives. That is, until Tuesday, when King announced that he had apparently been blocked from viewing the president’s tweets:   Trump has blocked me from reading his tweets. I may have to kill myself. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) June 13, 2017   The tipping point appeared to be a couple of pointed barbs aimed at the president’s Cabinet and his daughter, Ivanka Trump.   If Ivanka Trump had grown up in farm country, like some of us, she'd know her father is reaping exactly what he sowed. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) June 12, 2017   But it didn’t take long for another prominent Trump critic and literary icon to come to the rescue: Best-selling author J.K. Rowling promised that she would keep King informed of the president’s tweets.   I still have access. I'll DM them to you. https://t.co/MhibEYDBTg — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) June 13, 2017   Despite his dramatic initial tweet, King was quick to note that he wasn’t actually despondent. For many, in fact, being blocked by Trump — a phenomenon that has inspired a trending hashtag — is something of a mark of pride. Among left-leaning Twitter critics who make a point to respond directly to many of Trump’s tweets, some consider being blocked as a sign of success: Their words were getting through, and their messages effectively bothered the president, or at least someone monitoring his account.   Good grief, it's actually happened Mr Thin-skin strikes again! pic.twitter.com/PQSK60KRfa — Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) May 31, 2017     [They made it their mission to talk back to Trump on Twitter. But is anyone listening?]   Others, though, have found the abrupt cutoff more disturbing. Hours before King was barred from viewing Trump’s tweets, the president’s @realDonaldTrump account blocked VoteVets, a progressive advocacy group that claims to represent more than 500,000 veterans, military families and supporters. The group had decried Trump’s proposed travel ban, which limits travel from six predominately Muslim countries, as “unconstitutional, immoral” and a national security threat.   The Commander in Chief can block @VoteVets, the voice of 500k military veterans and families, but we will NOT be silenced. pic.twitter.com/SaCN5hKU9R — VoteVets (@votevets) June 13, 2017     Sad that our draft deferring Commander in Chief is unwilling to hear the voice for over 500,000 veterans, @VoteVets. https://t.co/tbBbD3GaGa — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) June 13, 2017   Some have questioned whether it is unconstitutional for a commander in chief to prevent certain members of the American public from seeing his public communications; this month, the Knight First Amendment Institute sent a letter to the president arguing that blocking Twitter users because of their opinions was a violation of the First Amendment.      Holly O'Reilly, a snarky Twitter critic of President Donald Trump, got blocked by him online. She says it's "a 21st-century violation of free speech." (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)     [Is @RealDonaldTrump violating the First Amendment by blocking some Twitter users?]   As for King, the development caught him so off guard that he first questioned whether it was a hoax. But even if it wasn’t, he assured Rowling in a tweet that he’d be okay: “I’ll always have Pence.”   Thanks. Maybe it's a hoax. I'm good either way. I'll always have Pence, hahahaha. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) June 13, 2017   Read more: How getting blocked by Trump on Twitter became a ‘badge of honor’         lifestyle  style-blog       true          Please provide a valid email address.

This class will present how project teams can collaborate to develop information on a BIM project. We will initially look at setting up a plan of work to give clarity on which team members are delivering what information and when. Following this we will look at how designers can develop their designs using standardised BIM objects in Revit. Practical examples will then be given on how to link these objects digitally to the associated specification to better coordinate this information and reduce risk. We will finish by exploring the role of the cloud and big data in future workflows and show practical examples of how the Forge platform can accelerate this. Stephen was part of the team that developed the UK government’s BIM Level 2 standards and tools. As director of research and innovation at NBS, he has been fundamental in developing the products that led to NBS being the first UK Autodesk Solution Associate in 2016.

                                                                            Solibri or Navisworks?
                                                                        



Collaboration in construction is challenging. How can you organise the quality in data and geometry with all these different parties and models? Which software do you use to check your model: Navisworks or Solibri? An IFC workflow with Solibri provides you with insights into the different clashes and the possibility to check in a rule-based manner. But how do you create reports and collaborate with team members? Does Navisworks manage a better workflow with more possibilities for everybody? With Navisworks you are free of file format. It is easy to append and update Revit, IFC, RCP or DWG files to a federated model in a single file. Check model geometry, duplicates, and data in a standardised way with Collaborea, the rule-based model checker for Navisworks. A report is no longer necessary because all the issues are visible and editable on a cloud platform using Autodesk Forge. Checking and collaborating becomes easy and editing the models in an Autodesk workflow is simple.

You’ve heard the buzz about this exciting new Autodesk platform called Forge. But what exactly is Forge? Forge is a platform of web service APIs that allow you to integrate Autodesk SaaS products (such as Fusion Team, BIM 360 Docs, etc.) into your workflows and/or to embed some of the components used in those Autodesk products into your own web or mobile applications. In this presentation I will explain in more detail what Forge is (and what it isn’t) - and show you examples of how to use Forge to enhance your on workflows and applications. This class is suitable for software developers,  CAD & IT managers and decision makers.



 
 




















                                                                            
                                                                                Jeremy Tammik
                                                                                
                                                                            
                                                                        



                                                                            Connect Desktop and Cloud—Free Your BIM Data
                                                                        



Your Building Information Modeling (BIM) data increases significantly in value the more you make use of it. Cloud-based technologies make this extremely easy. We explore how to connect the desktop and the cloud to make any BIM data you choose available to anyone you choose, including optional round-trip real-time editing of selected properties and features. This class discusses extracting information from your Revit Models, enhancing Collaboration for Revit workflows, new additions to the growing suite of The Building Coder desktop-BIM-cloud samples, AEC related Forge APIs such as the Viewer and the Model Derivative API. The latter enables easy translation of design files to different formats and extracting data from them to use almost anywhere. Using demonstrations and dissections of sample applications, we show how these programming tools can easily and vastly enhance your BIM workflows. This is an advanced class for experienced programmers. This session features Revit and Forge.

                                                                            Harness the Latest Autodesk Cloud Offerings to Drive the Future of Making Buildings
                                                                        



The aim of this roundtable is to gather individuals who are excited about how the future of making things is shaping the building and construction industry. We will look at how the industry has progressed from an age of 2D flatland data production, to the more advanced age of optimization of 3D digital data, to the present-day era of interoperability and collaboration in a new age of connection. We will focus on how we conceptualize, share information, collaborate, construct, and deliver smart buildings that can be analyzed, rated on performance, monitored, and maintained. The roundtable will look at how the present and future Autodesk, Inc., cloud technology—including Forge Platform—is set to radically change and revolutionize this process by making the transition from conceptual Building Information Modeling (BIM) to constructional BIM as smooth and seamless as possible. We will focus on how to optimally connect the digital data around designing, constructing, and managing buildings with reduced risk and improved outcomes.

                                                                            Electronics Cooling Simulation Roundtable
                                                                        



We invite customers who have a need to simulate thermal management of electronics to attend this roundtable. We plan on discussing and discovering common electrical computer-aided design (ECAD) and mechanical computer-aided design (MCAD) workflows, going from ideation, conceptual layout, and final design. Thermal management fits in this design process throughout and we will present some mockups on how we see the next generation of simulation fitting into the design process. We hope to gain insight from the roundtable regarding how participants currently manage the ECAD data and use it along with MCAD data to perform thermal simulation, where their struggles are, and what could be done to make everything easier. This session features CFD, Forge, and Fusion 360.
