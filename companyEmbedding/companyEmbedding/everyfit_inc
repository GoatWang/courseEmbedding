The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection1. Everyfit Inc114 State St Fl 3Boston, MA 02109(857) 239-8425Mobile Home ParksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection2. Everyfit Inc44 School StBoston, MA 02108(617) 227-0743No Internet Heading AssignedAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection3. Everyfit Inc-Cambridge101 Tremont St Ste 412Boston, MA 02108(617) 945-7572No Internet Heading AssignedAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection4. Everyfit Inc114 Saint Andrew RdEast Boston, MA 02128(857) 239-8425Manufactured Housing-CommunitiesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection5. Everyfit Inc44 School Street PlRoxbury, MA 02119(617) 945-7572Radiotelephone...WebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Everyfit Inc-Cambridge33 Richdale AveCambridge, MA 02140(617) 945-7572Physicians & Surgeons, Family Medicine...Businesses in related categories to Manufactured Housing-CommunitiesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection7. Higgins Mobilehomes Inc: Sunset Acres & Brookside VillageBBB Rating: A+45 Washington StPlainville, MA 02762(508) 809-4285Mobile Home ParksManufactured HomesWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoFrom Business: Higgins Mobilehomes Inc. is the home of two retirement communities in Plainville, Massachusetts.
