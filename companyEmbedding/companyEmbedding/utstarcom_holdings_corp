History[edit]
The company was founded in 1991 by Hong Liang Lu, a Chinese-born, American-educated entrepreneur, as Unitech Telecom. The start-up company was based in Oakland, California. In its early years, the company was focused on the telecommunications markets in China, with its initial presence in China established in 1993 in Hangzhou.[3] In 1995, Unitech merged with Starcom Networks, founded by Ying Wu and Chauncey Shey, to form UTStarcom. After several years of trying to build its business in China, UTStarcom launched the Personal Handy-phone System, also known as the Personal Handy-phone System. UTStarcom went public in March 2000. The IPO and a series of acquisitions helped the company expand its business and technology beyond its base in China to other emerging economies in Asia and Latin America as well as to Japan, the United States and Europe. Between 2002 and 2004, UTStarcom acquired several companies to expand its technology portfolio and market opportunities in areas such as handsets, CDMA technology, broadband and IP-based communications. UTStarcom sold its Personal Communications Devices to AIG Investments in July 2008.
Since its foundation, the company’s portfolio has included a wide range of telecommunication systems and solutions: NGN & Softswitch systems, IPTV platforms, Personal Access System (PAS) technology, 3G mobile technology, mobile handsets, optical transport solutions, broadband and IP-based communications including such products as MSAN, DSLAM, Gigabit EPON (GEPON), various subscriber equipment. Currently the company’s focus is on packet optical networking equipment, wireless products, broadband access products, and SDN-related solutions.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for UTStarcom Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:UTSI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

UTStarcom is a global telecom infrastructure provider headquartered in Hong Kong.[1] The company develops and supplies a broad range of telecommunication solutions to communications service providers and network operators including fixed and mobile network operators, as well as to enterprises.
The Company is focused on delivering carrier-class broadband transport and access (both wireless (Wi-Fi) and fixed line) products and solutions, optimized for mobile backhaul, metro aggregation, broadband access and Wi-Fi data. The broadband product lines include family of packet transport network (PTN) products based on Multiprotocol Label Switching - Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) and Carrier Ethernet technologies enhanced through in-house SDN platform to support the network evolution, and MSAN platform. Wireless broadband access is represented by end-to-end Carrier Wi-Fi solution.[2] In addition to established product lines marketed worldwide, the company also explores new markets and develops new products including intelligent customer edge devices (Virtual Broadband Gateway) and data center switch products.
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1991 by Hong Liang Lu, a Chinese-born, American-educated entrepreneur, as Unitech Telecom. The start-up company was based in Oakland, California. In its early years, the company was focused on the telecommunications markets in China, with its initial presence in China established in 1993 in Hangzhou.[3] In 1995, Unitech merged with Starcom Networks, founded by Ying Wu and Chauncey Shey, to form UTStarcom. After several years of trying to build its business in China, UTStarcom launched the Personal Handy-phone System, also known as the Personal Handy-phone System. UTStarcom went public in March 2000. The IPO and a series of acquisitions helped the company expand its business and technology beyond its base in China to other emerging economies in Asia and Latin America as well as to Japan, the United States and Europe. Between 2002 and 2004, UTStarcom acquired several companies to expand its technology portfolio and market opportunities in areas such as handsets, CDMA technology, broadband and IP-based communications. UTStarcom sold its Personal Communications Devices to AIG Investments in July 2008.
Since its foundation, the company’s portfolio has included a wide range of telecommunication systems and solutions: NGN & Softswitch systems, IPTV platforms, Personal Access System (PAS) technology, 3G mobile technology, mobile handsets, optical transport solutions, broadband and IP-based communications including such products as MSAN, DSLAM, Gigabit EPON (GEPON), various subscriber equipment. Currently the company’s focus is on packet optical networking equipment, wireless products, broadband access products, and SDN-related solutions.

UTStarcom is a global telecom infrastructure provider headquartered in Hong Kong.[1] The company develops and supplies a broad range of telecommunication solutions to communications service providers and network operators including fixed and mobile network operators, as well as to enterprises.
The Company is focused on delivering carrier-class broadband transport and access (both wireless (Wi-Fi) and fixed line) products and solutions, optimized for mobile backhaul, metro aggregation, broadband access and Wi-Fi data. The broadband product lines include family of packet transport network (PTN) products based on Multiprotocol Label Switching - Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) and Carrier Ethernet technologies enhanced through in-house SDN platform to support the network evolution, and MSAN platform. Wireless broadband access is represented by end-to-end Carrier Wi-Fi solution.[2] In addition to established product lines marketed worldwide, the company also explores new markets and develops new products including intelligent customer edge devices (Virtual Broadband Gateway) and data center switch products.
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1991 by Hong Liang Lu, a Chinese-born, American-educated entrepreneur, as Unitech Telecom. The start-up company was based in Oakland, California. In its early years, the company was focused on the telecommunications markets in China, with its initial presence in China established in 1993 in Hangzhou.[3] In 1995, Unitech merged with Starcom Networks, founded by Ying Wu and Chauncey Shey, to form UTStarcom. After several years of trying to build its business in China, UTStarcom launched the Personal Handy-phone System, also known as the Personal Handy-phone System. UTStarcom went public in March 2000. The IPO and a series of acquisitions helped the company expand its business and technology beyond its base in China to other emerging economies in Asia and Latin America as well as to Japan, the United States and Europe. Between 2002 and 2004, UTStarcom acquired several companies to expand its technology portfolio and market opportunities in areas such as handsets, CDMA technology, broadband and IP-based communications. UTStarcom sold its Personal Communications Devices to AIG Investments in July 2008.
Since its foundation, the company’s portfolio has included a wide range of telecommunication systems and solutions: NGN & Softswitch systems, IPTV platforms, Personal Access System (PAS) technology, 3G mobile technology, mobile handsets, optical transport solutions, broadband and IP-based communications including such products as MSAN, DSLAM, Gigabit EPON (GEPON), various subscriber equipment. Currently the company’s focus is on packet optical networking equipment, wireless products, broadband access products, and SDN-related solutions.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
