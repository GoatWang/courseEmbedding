In 1930, in the midst of the Great Depression, Van Duyn Dodge and E. Morris Cox formed a partnership to provide investment counsel. Their confidence in this endeavor was fortified by Morrie Cox’s conviction that “well-conceived professional investment management could bring the force of some order into a rather chaotic investment world.”

To that end, they established a blueprint for managing an investment firm emphasizing independent ownership, stability, and high ethical standards. They also developed the investing principles that remain in place at Dodge & Cox today: a long-term investment horizon, individual security selection grounded by the relationship of fundamentals to valuation, and portfolio diversification. With this foundation, we manage equity, fixed income, and balanced separate accounts, mutual funds, 
				and UCITS funds for individuals and institutions from a single office location, two blocks from where the firm began.
The firm’s independence frees us to pursue the singular goal of creating lasting value for our clients. The longevity and stability of our investment team enable us to fully incorporate the lessons from past market environments into the ongoing stewardship of our clients’ assets. Finally, we believe that the best way to succeed as a firm is to focus our resources on serving our existing clients well. 
The philosophy that guides the management of our investment portfolios is built on traditional principles: we invest with a long-term horizon, employ a rigorous price discipline, and conduct our own research. Our decision-making process takes full advantage of individual insights within a team-oriented culture. These factors drive the achievement of the competitive returns we seek for our clients.

* Since inception returns are provided for Funds with less than twenty years of performance history.
				† The Global Stock Fund’s inception date was May 1, 2008. The International Stock Fund's inception date was May 1, 2001.
				                    
					††  Dodge & Cox Global Bond Fund, L.L.C., 
				a private fund managed and funded by Dodge & Cox (the “Private 
				Fund”) was reorganized into the Fund and the Fund commenced 
				operations on May 1, 2014. The Private Fund was organized as 
				Delaware limited liability company and was treated as a 
				disregarded entity under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
				amended (the “Code”). The Private Fund commenced operations on 
				December 5, 2012, and had an investment objective, policies, and 
				strategies that were, in all material respects, the same as 
				those of the Fund, and was managed in a manner that, in all 
				material respects, complied with the investment guidelines and 
				restrictions of the Fund. However, the Private Fund was not 
				registered as an investment company under the Investment Company 
				Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”), and therefore was not subject to 
				certain investment limitations, diversification requirements, 
				liquidity requirements, and other restrictions imposed by the 
				1940 Act and the Code, which, if applicable, may have adversely 
				affected its performance. The Fund’s performance for periods 
				prior to the commencement of operations on May 1, 2014, is that 
				of the Private Fund. The performance of the Private Fund has not 
				been restated because the net total operating expense ratio of 
				the Private Fund and the Fund are the same. Expense 
				reimbursements have been in effect for the Fund since its 
				inception. Without the expense reimbursements, returns for the 
				Fund would have been lower.
All returns are stated in U.S. 
					   dollars, unless otherwise noted. The Funds’ total returns include the reinvestment of dividend and capital gain distributions, but have not been adjusted for any income taxes payable by shareholders on these distributions 
				or on Fund share redemptions. Index returns include dividend and/or interest income 
				but, unlike Fund returns, do not reflect fees or expenses.
The S&P 500 Index is a market 
				capitalization-weighted index of 500 large-capitalization stocks 
				commonly used to represent the U.S. equity market. The MSCI 
				World Index is a broad-based, unmanaged equity market index 
				aggregated from 24 developed market country indices, including 
				the United States. The MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, Far East) 
				Index is a broad-based, unmanaged equity market index aggregated 
				from 22 developed market country indices, excluding the United 
				States. The Combined Index reflects an unmanaged portfolio 
				(rebalanced monthly) of 60% of the S&P 500, and 40% of the BBG Barclays 
				U.S. Agg. 
				The Fund may, however, invest up to 75% of its total assets in 
				stocks. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (BBG Barclays U.S. 
				Agg) is 
				a widely recognized, unmanaged index of U.S. dollar-denominated 
				investment-grade fixed income securities. The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index (BBG Barclays Global Agg) is a widely recognized, unmanaged index of multi-currency, investment-grade fixed income securities. 
MSCI makes no express or implied warranties 
				or representations and shall have no liability whatsoever with 
				respect to any MSCI data contained herein. The data may not be 
				further redistributed or used as a basis for other indices or 
				any securities or financial products. This report is not 
				approved, reviewed, or produced by MSCI.

objectives
The Fund seeks regular income, conservation of principal, and an opportunity for long-term growth of principal and income.

Strategy
The Fund invests in a diversified portfolio of equity securities and debt securities.
 Stocks — The Fund typically invests 
				  in companies that, in Dodge & Cox’s opinion, appear to be temporarily undervalued by the stock market but have a favorable outlook for long-term growth. Under normal circumstances the Fund will hold no more than 75%, and no less than 25%, of its total assets in 
				  equity securities. The Fund focuses on the underlying financial condition and prospects of individual companies, including future earnings, cash flow, and dividends. Various other factors, including financial strength, economic condition, competitive advantage, quality of the business franchise, and the reputation, experience, and competence of a company’s management are weighed against valuation in selecting individual securities.
 Fixed Income Securities — Debt securities in which the Fund may invest include investment-grade securities such as government and government-related obligations, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds, and other debt securities and may include fixed and floating rate instruments.  A maximum of 20% of the debt portion of the Fund may be invested in debt obligations rated below investment grade. The proportions of Fund assets 
				  invested in various classes of debt securities will be revised in light of Dodge & Cox's appraisal of the economy, the relative yields of securities in the various market sectors, the investment prospects for issuers, and other factors. In selecting securities, Dodge & Cox considers many factors, including yield, credit ratings, liquidity, call risk, duration, structure, and capital appreciation potential.

objectives
The Fund seeks a high and stable rate of current income, consistent with long-term preservation of capital. A secondary objective is to take advantage of opportunities to realize capital appreciation.

Strategy
The Fund invests in a diversified portfolio 
				consisting primarily of high-quality bonds and other debt securities. Debt securities in which the Fund may invest include government and government-related obligations, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds, and other
debt securities, and may include fixed and floating rate instruments. A maximum of 20% of the Fund’s total assets may be invested in debt obligations rated below investment grade.

The proportions of Fund assets 
				  invested in various classes of debt securities will be revised in light of Dodge & Cox's appraisal of the economy, the relative yields of securities in the various market sectors, the investment prospects for issuers, and other factors. In selecting securities, Dodge & Cox considers many factors, including yield, credit ratings, liquidity, call risk, duration, structure, and capital appreciation potential.

 Biography




 




January 10, 2015


In their early days at Dodge & Cox some 30 years ago, Dana Emery and Charles Pohl sat within shouting distance of each other, lived in the same neighborhood, and often rode the bus together to and from their office in San Francisco’s financial district. “We always talked about what we would do if we were running the firm,” Pohl chuckles. “It was a...

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Investment Disciplines
Investment management is Dodge &amp Cox’s only business. We are focused on providing U.S., global, and international equity; fixed income; and balanced account management. 


Equity — The philosophy guiding the management of our equity portfolios is built on traditional principles: we maintain a long-term focus with a three- to five-year investment horizon, conduct our own research, and employ a rigorous price discipline. Our approach is research-intensive; decisions are based on individual company analysis by our team of investment professionals.
Fixed Income — Dodge & Cox’s fixed income philosophy is to construct and manage a high average quality portfolio of securities that are selected through bottom-up, fundamental analysis. We believe that by combining fundamental research with a long-term investment horizon it is possible to uncover and act upon inefficiencies in the valuation of market sectors and individual securities.
Balanced — Our objective in managing balanced accounts is to provide regular income, conservation of principal, and an opportunity for long-term growth of principal and income. Our strategy is to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and fixed income securities. Asset allocation between stocks and bonds is based on our assessment of the potential returns for each asset class over a three- to five-year time horizon. 
Offerings
Through mutual funds and separate accounts, Dodge & Cox provides services to:


Individuals
High Net Worth Individuals
Corporations
Corporate Retirement Plans
Public Retirement Plans

objectives
The Fund seeks long-term growth of principal and income. A secondary objective is to achieve a reasonable current income.
Strategy
The Fund invests primarily in a diversified portfolio of equity securities. In selecting investments, the Fund typically invests in companies that, in Dodge & Cox's opinion, appear to be temporarily undervalued by the stock market but have a favorable outlook for long-term growth. The Fund focuses on the underlying financial condition and prospects of individual companies, including future earnings, cash flow, and dividends. Various other factors, including financial strength, economic condition, competitive advantage, quality of the business franchise, and the reputation, experience, and competence of a company's management are weighed against valuation in selecting individual securities.
