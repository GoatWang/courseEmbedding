Bio:
          Scott Peppet is a Professor of Law at the University of Colorado Law School, where he has taught Contracts, Legal Negotiation,  Counseling Family Enterprises, and Legal Ethics since 2000. His scholarship focuses in two areas: the ethics of alternative dispute resolution and privacy, technology and contract. In the former area he has published both an award-winning book - Beyond Winning (Harvard University Press) -- and various academic articles on the use of contingency fees by mediators, the use of mediation in transactions as opposed to disputes, and the ethics of collaborative law. His more recent scholarship on privacy, technology and contract has focused on the privacy problems of self-disclosure (Unraveling Privacy, Northwestern University Law Review 2011), the impact of new technologies on consumer contract law (Freedom of Contract in an Augmented Reality, UCLA Law Review 2012), and the ways in which technology is changing prostitution markets (Prostitution 3.0, forthcoming Iowa Law Review 2013). Prior to joining the Colorado faculty he taught as a Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School and was a Senior Fellow on Negotiation at the Harvard Negotiation Research Project. In 2002, CU students honored him with their Excellence in Teaching Award. He lives in Boulder with his wife, children, and Quarter-horse named Betsy.
Professor Peppet serves on the Board of Directors of Anixter Inc. (AXE: NYSE) and the Ownership Committee of Equity International, Inc.

Lawyers' Bargaining Ethics, Contract, and Collaboration: The End of the Legal Profession and the Beginning of Professional Pluralism, 90 Iowa L. Rev. 475 (2005).

                
                    This Article combines contractarian economics and traditional ethical theory to argue for a radical revision of the legal profession's codes of ethics. That revision would end the legal profession as  we know it?one profession, regulated by one set of ethical rules that apply  to all lawyers regardless of circumstance. It would replace the existing  uniform conception of the lawyer's role with a more heterogeneous profession in which lawyers and clients could contractually choose the ethical obligations under which they wanted to operate. This "contract model" of legal ethics, in which lawyers could opt in and out of various ethical constraints, would lead to greater efficiencies, greater satisfaction for attorneys and clients, and greater vitality for the legal profession.

Contract Formation in Imperfect Markets:  Should We Use Mediators in Deals?, 19 Ohio St. J. Disp. Resol. 283 (2004).

                
                    This Article asks a simple question: Could third-party mediators be helpful in deals, just as they are in disputes? This Article makes a theoretical argument for such interventions, but also presents preliminary empirical evidence suggesting that transactional mediation may already be taking place.

Can Saints Negotiate? An Introduction to the Problems of Perfect  Ethics in Bargaining, 7 Harv. Neg. L. Rev. 83 (symposium) (2002).

                
                    This piece, presented at a symposium on "mindfulness" in legal practice, asks whether mindfulness practices square with partisanship.  More generally, the piece investigates the question of whether two "saints" can have anything to negotiate.  This question is of particular relevance to debate over the meaning of zealous advocacy in legal ethics, as often pracitioners ask whether under a regime of full disclosure and honest practice they would have anything left to do.

About This BookAbout the AuthorsReviewsTable of Contents 

Conflict is inevitable, in both deals and disputes. Yet when clients call in the lawyers to haggle over who gets how much of the pie, traditional hard-bargaining tactics can lead to ruin. Too often, deals blow up, cases don’t settle, relationships fall apart, justice is delayed. Beyond Winning charts a way out of our current crisis of confidence in the legal system. It offers a fresh look at negotiation, aimed at helping lawyers turn disputes into deals, and deals into better deals, through practical, tough-minded problem-solving techniques.
In this step-by-step guide to conflict resolution, the authors describe the many obstacles that can derail a legal negotiation, both behind the bargaining table with one’s own client and across the table with the other side. They offer clear, candid advice about ways lawyers can search for beneficial trades, enlarge the scope of interests, improve communication, minimize transaction costs, and leave both sides better off than before. But lawyers cannot do the job alone. People who hire lawyers must help change the game from conflict to collaboration. The entrepreneur structuring a joint venture, the plaintiff embroiled in a civil suit, the CEO negotiating an employment contract, the real estate developer concerned with environmental hazards, the parent considering a custody battle—clients who understand the pressures and incentives a lawyer faces can work more effectively within the legal system to promote their own best interests. Attorneys exhausted by the trench warfare of cases that drag on for years will find here a positive, proven approach to revitalizing their profession.

July 13: Liu Xiaobo and the Responsibility of Being Alive
The Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo died today, a few short weeks after the Chinese government revealed that he was suffering from cancer that had progressed beyond treatment during his political imprisonment. The course of his life was forever altered by the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989, and, as Perry Link notes at NYR Daily, Liu felt haunted by the “lost souls” of Tiananmen, “the aggrieved ghosts of students and workers alike whose ages would forever be the same as on the night they died.” His widow Liu Xia reports that he dedicated his Nobel Prize to them in 2010, as he’d done in 2003 after receiving an award from the Chinese Demo…

About This BookAbout the AuthorsReviewsTable of Contents 


“[Beyond Winning] rallies all of the [Harvard Negotiation Research Project’s] prior gems of wisdom on negotiation around the central theme of creating value. [The book] should be required reading for all lawyers and law students, for all mediators and judges. It is a book that every lawyer should ask his or her client to read (or reread) prior to commencing any important transaction or dispute, negotiation or mediation. Crafted in a reader-friendly style, the book energetically promotes an interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving in negotiation… In contrast to other experts’ advice to be reactive initially in a negotiation, the authors here encourage a proactive, ‘take charge’ approach to engaging negotiators across the table in problem-solving. This approach is not initially directed to the substance of the dispute or transaction, but rather to the nature and structure of the negotiation process that the parties might together design… This is a book for everyone who negotiates—a universe that includes all of us. Inevitably, it will move lawyers into a new paradigm of thinking about higher-quality solutions in negotiation and mediation, and about how to achieve the best possible results for their clients. It is bound to change the world of negotiation in this new millennium.”—John W. Cooley, ABA Journal
“The practice of law has become more contentious and competitive, not less. The authors of [Beyond Winning]…advocate that parties [instead] practice ‘value creation’ (i.e., the attempt to ‘enlarge the pie’) so that both parties to a negotiation receive bigger returns… The book does an excellent job of breaking down relationships, players, tensions and organizations to lay bare the inner-workings of the actors in a negotiation and the situations they create. Because of its unique objective of educating attorneys and clients, Beyond Winning is a good addition to any library on negotiation.”—William J. Estes, New York Law Journal
“Conventional negotiating strategy often requires adversarial positions, but the authors propose viewing negotiating as a problem-solving task… They explain that creating value is the key to successful negotiating. The goal should not be to win the biggest piece of the pie but to make the pie bigger!”—David Rouse, Booklist
“Observing that today’s tough, adversarial legal negotiations preempt mutually beneficial problem solving between parties, Mnookin and his coauthors urge lawyers to adopt a proactive, optimistic and realistic mindset to transform their practices… [Although] aimed…at attorneys who want to serve clients’ broader needs better as well as to protect their interests, the authors’ practical, straightforward and jargon-free style makes this a valuable resource for anybody who is about to hire an attorney, file a lawsuit or sign a contract.”—Publishers Weekly
“On the cutting edge of negotiation literature, Beyond Winning is a spectacular integration of our contemporary understanding of negotiation, modern social science, and the legal context. This is an excellent book and is sure to become a must-read for lawyers, law students, and executives who deal with the legal process on a regular basis.”—Max Bazerman, Harvard Business School
“The authors provide specific, concrete strategies lawyers and their clients can employ to mitigate the tensions that make legal negotiation so difficult. They integrate theory and practice in ways that do justice to the complexity of each.”—Jennifer Girarda Brown, Quinnipiac College School of Law
“Much negotiation literature suffers from one of two problems. Either it is too theoretical to be of use to practitioners or it is simplistic, purporting to give advice to negotiators in cookbook form. Beyond Winning captures the most important theoretical economic and social science material and uses vivid examples to demonstrate techniques for using theoretical insights in practice. The mini-case histories and transcripts of portions of negotiations that appear throughout the book are especially valuable ways both to illustrate theory and to provide practical guidance for its application.”—Carol B. Liebman, Columbia Law School
“With its lively examples and its innovative framework for managing the tensions intrinsic to any negotiation, Beyond Winning is must reading for lawmakers as well as lawyers—for anyone, in fact, who is charged with resolving intractable disputes and forging lasting agreements.”—Senator George Mitchell

Smart Mortgages, Privacy and the Regulatory Possibility of Infomediation

 U of Colorado Law Legal Studies Research Paper No. 09-13

Abstract
This Article argues for a new regulatory approach that could both increase market efficiency and protect informational privacy in the modern information economy. It explores that approach - information intermediation, or infomediation - in the context of the current debates about re-engineering the mortgage markets in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In particular, the Article is the first scholarly work to introduce the concept of “smart mortgages” - loans and mortgage securities with more rich and dynamically updated information than traditional mortgage products. The Article considers recent regulatory and industry momentum behind smart mortgages and contrasts the market efficiencies created by such proposals against the individual and social privacy harms a smart mortgage system would inflict. It argues that policy makers should consider information intermediation as a regulatory option to capture the efficiency gains of smart mortgages while preserving individual informational privacy, and considers the implications of infomediation beyond the mortgage context for other similar debates about the future of privacy in an information-rich economy. In particular, the Article concludes by comparing the smart mortgage and healthcare reform debates and showing the possible role of infomediation in each. In sum, the author argues that smart mortgages done properly could be a foundational step forwards as an example of regulatory sophistication.
