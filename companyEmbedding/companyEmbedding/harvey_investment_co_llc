Approaching Your Needs Together







Before we can develop an investment strategy for you, we get to know you. Why are you investing? What do you want to do? This is your financial future. It shouldn't be left to chance or some off-the-shelf plan.
The approach we work through together should be as individual as you are. When you partner with an Edward Jones financial advisor, we follow an established process that starts with asking, "What's important to you?" And then we listen. Really listen.
After we understand what's important to you and why, together we build a strategy tailored just for you based on your financial needs.

To work toward achieving your goals
By working through the Edward Jones 5-step Asset Management Process with you, your local financial advisor can:

Help assess your tolerance for risk
Create a quantifiable, actionable financial goal based on what's important to you
Recommend investments and strategies that support and align with your goals



Step 1: Where am I today?
It's difficult to plan for the future without an understanding of where you stand today. This means identifying and prioritizing your needs, assessing your tolerance for risk and understanding what impacts your current financial picture – things like income, expenses and any savings. Talking about these factors helps shape the advice your financial advisor can offer and the strategy you'll build together to get you where you want to go.
Step 2: Where would I like to be?
After determining where you are today, the next step is identifying where you'd like to be. What does your vision for the future look like? What are you trying to accomplish?
This discussion is very important. Your financial advisor will use this information and our tools to translate your vision into a personal, measurable goal and to develop a written strategy to track your progress.
Step 3: Can I get there?
This is where the rubber meets the road. You know where you stand, what you want to do in the future and how much risk you're comfortable taking to get there. Your financial advisor can now help you answer the big question "Can I get there?" Together, you'll analyze what you're currently doing and discuss any adjustments you can make to better position you to achieve your goals.
Step 4: How do I get there?
Discussing the first three steps allows your financial advisor to understand your complete financial picture – your needs, attitude toward risk, progress toward your goal, and current investment strategy.
Taking these factors into consideration, along with our firm's investment principles, your financial advisor can identify the most appropriate investments, protection and services to get you where you want to be.
It's also important that you understand and are comfortable with the fees that come along with these investments and services. That's why your financial advisor will walk you through the costs involved before you implement these recommendations.
Step 5: How can I stay on track?
The last step may be one of the most important. After building a solid strategy, we'll work together to make sure you stay on track. This is more than just what we do in the office – it's about regularly checking in about questions you have, or changes in your life or the market, that may affect your current path.
Putting your team in place
We believe that when it comes to financial matters, the value of professional advice cannot be overestimated. Depending on what's important to you and the strategies you put into place, it may make sense to bring your legal and tax professionals into this process. Your financial advisor will work in partnership with the other key members of your team – like your CPA or attorney, and the 5,500 associates at our home office – as needed to help achieve your success.
How we can help
Starting this process is as simple as answering a few questions to help determine what's important to you. Get started today by contacting your local financial advisor.

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it?

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.

Skip to main content







In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

Corporations Compared to LLCs - Corporation Topics | LegalZoom


































In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Our Background and People
In the fall of 2000, Harvey Investment Company, LLC was formed to provide investors a pure research-driven, 
                            independent-thinking investment solution that focuses on building wealth with an eye toward preservation of 
                            capital, while providing superior customer service.
The equity securities that we buy to construct your portfolio will be chosen internally by our research team. We have a very clear idea of what we are 
                            looking for, and, while we have access to a wide range of outside research services for information, we rely on our own judgment when we act.
We limit our fixed income selections to corporate, U.S Treasury, government agency, and municipal securities rated investment grade or better by the primary rating agencies. We do not speculate or 
                            attempt to enhance fixed income returns by buying lower quality bonds.

Advisory Services











Acquisition Advisory
Harvey & Company serves as an advisor to a select group of corporations seeking to build their business via acquisition. Often these clients are private-equity backed or publicly-traded, but increasingly family-held companies also recognize the importance of acquisition growth as a component of value creation.
Acquirers engage Harvey & Company because of the deep domain experience of our deal teams and a proven track record of advising buyers. Through two decades of co-investing alongside private equity funds and working to build those investments through acquisition, we have developed a skillset that can be very valuable to any organization embarking on a proactive acquisition strategy.
Harvey & Company has seven teams of investment professionals each led by a senior project manager with an average of 10+ years of experience in private equity and corporate acquisitions within their focus industries. We act as an outsourced business development team or augment an organization’s internal team to execute on their strategy. Our services include:

Working with management to identify the most strategic and accretive acquisitions
Manage the process of discreet and professional outreach to business owners
Facilitate discussions and analysis of attractive opportunities
Leverage our industry experience and connections

Our experience enables us to efficiently and proactively identify and evaluate strategic and relevant opportunities, which has led to our involvement in over 150 add-on acquisitions. This success has fostered an expanding base of clients.

Our Mission and Philosophy

We believe that there is an investment discipline which leaves wide open the opportunity for the tremendous financial benefits of 
                            common stock ownership and which also meaningfully reduces the risk of the substantial, permanent losses that are often associated with investment in the stock market. 
                            The Holy Grail for investors is more reward and less risk. The approach that offers this is easy to describe and understand, but the skills required to execute it effectively 
                            are won only with the guidance of extraordinary mentors and years of hard experience. We have practiced this approach for more than three decades and have observed its successful 
                            application by like minded investors as well. We believe strongly that a firm should exist in our community that offers this approach in its pure form. We provide it.
Our investment philosophy is based on the concept that the expected cash flows to owners of stocks and bonds create a core value that is independent from the quoted market price of such assets. 
Because markets are emotional, buying opportunities arise when assets are priced far below their core value, and selling opportunities appear when assets are priced far above their core value. 
If we are accurate in our assessment of core value and diligent in executing our strategies, we should provide better than average profits with meaningfully reduced risk.

In partnership with the CEO and other key members of the management team, Harvey & Company and a private equity group made an investment in All Holding Company which provided liquidity for shareholders and strategic capital to usher in the company’s next phase of growth.

Initially formed through the 2008 merger of two family-owned protein processing companies (Alderfer and Leidy’s), AHC serves the retail, co-pack, food service, and further processor markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Aided by its close relationships with local family farms which supply antibiotic-free and conventional hogs, AHC is poised to meet growing consumer demand for healthier meat products while simultaneously improving animal welfare standards through vegetarian and stress-free, humane living conditions.
The partners plan to build upon AHC’s reputation as a leader in its space and grow the company more rapidly through both organic growth initiatives and complementary add-on acquisitions.

Approaching Your Needs Together







Before we can develop an investment strategy for you, we get to know you. Why are you investing? What do you want to do? This is your financial future. It shouldn't be left to chance or some off-the-shelf plan.
The approach we work through together should be as individual as you are. When you partner with an Edward Jones financial advisor, we follow an established process that starts with asking, "What's important to you?" And then we listen. Really listen.
After we understand what's important to you and why, together we build a strategy tailored just for you based on your financial needs.

To work toward achieving your goals
By working through the Edward Jones 5-step Asset Management Process with you, your local financial advisor can:

Help assess your tolerance for risk
Create a quantifiable, actionable financial goal based on what's important to you
Recommend investments and strategies that support and align with your goals



Step 1: Where am I today?
It's difficult to plan for the future without an understanding of where you stand today. This means identifying and prioritizing your needs, assessing your tolerance for risk and understanding what impacts your current financial picture – things like income, expenses and any savings. Talking about these factors helps shape the advice your financial advisor can offer and the strategy you'll build together to get you where you want to go.
Step 2: Where would I like to be?
After determining where you are today, the next step is identifying where you'd like to be. What does your vision for the future look like? What are you trying to accomplish?
This discussion is very important. Your financial advisor will use this information and our tools to translate your vision into a personal, measurable goal and to develop a written strategy to track your progress.
Step 3: Can I get there?
This is where the rubber meets the road. You know where you stand, what you want to do in the future and how much risk you're comfortable taking to get there. Your financial advisor can now help you answer the big question "Can I get there?" Together, you'll analyze what you're currently doing and discuss any adjustments you can make to better position you to achieve your goals.
Step 4: How do I get there?
Discussing the first three steps allows your financial advisor to understand your complete financial picture – your needs, attitude toward risk, progress toward your goal, and current investment strategy.
Taking these factors into consideration, along with our firm's investment principles, your financial advisor can identify the most appropriate investments, protection and services to get you where you want to be.
It's also important that you understand and are comfortable with the fees that come along with these investments and services. That's why your financial advisor will walk you through the costs involved before you implement these recommendations.
Step 5: How can I stay on track?
The last step may be one of the most important. After building a solid strategy, we'll work together to make sure you stay on track. This is more than just what we do in the office – it's about regularly checking in about questions you have, or changes in your life or the market, that may affect your current path.
Putting your team in place
We believe that when it comes to financial matters, the value of professional advice cannot be overestimated. Depending on what's important to you and the strategies you put into place, it may make sense to bring your legal and tax professionals into this process. Your financial advisor will work in partnership with the other key members of your team – like your CPA or attorney, and the 5,500 associates at our home office – as needed to help achieve your success.
How we can help
Starting this process is as simple as answering a few questions to help determine what's important to you. Get started today by contacting your local financial advisor.

There's also a super-low expense ratio of just 0.16%, so you'll get to keep more of your money.Income remains the priority for many investors, whether they need dividends to help fund their living expenses or because these regular cash payments are reinvested to multiply returns. Investors should also check the market for volatility as well as new opportunities regularly to bolster their returns. However, the mantra for successful wealth creation continues to be systematic investment over the long term. The above funds have rewarded investors with good performance over the years.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
