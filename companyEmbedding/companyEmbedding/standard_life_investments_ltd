Governance, Stewardship and responsible investment
The integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into our investment process is an important component of our Focus on Change investment philosophy. We have two dedicated teams, with distinct skill sets, that provide our investment teams with expert knowledge on the material ESG issues for our clients.




Governance and Stewardship
The Governance and Stewardship team focuses on the structure and composition of boards, the skills required to run effective boards, remuneration, our stewardship responsibilities, voting, and governance thought leadership.

>





Responsible Investment
Our Responsible Investment team focuses on the environmental and social performance of our investments.  Our focus can be captured into four areas of human rights, employment issues, business ethics & the community and the environment.  This team also oversees these aspects in relation to our dedicated Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI) and Ethical Investment products and services.

Multi-asset capabilities
Successfully managing a variety of multi-asset portfolios demands an exceptionally broad and skilled investment capability. At Standard Life Investments, we have extensive experience and diversity of talent across all global asset classes – including equities, fixed income, real estate, money markets and private equity.

Investment Expertise



Equities

Standard Life Investments manages a full range of equity strategies that span the risk/return spectrum. While distinct in their risk tolerances and return objectives, our equity portfolios share a common goal: to consistently add value through active management.





Fixed income

Standard Life Investments offers fixed income capabilities across a wide range of sub-sectors and geographies. Our commitment to the asset class is underlined by the extensive range of fixed income strategies we have developed to meet the needs of both existing and new clients.





Real estate

The benefits of investing in real estate are compelling. Over the long term, the returns from real estate have a low correlation with equities and bonds. This means that real estate can help to spread risk and create diversified investment portfolios. In addition, real estate offers relatively stable income in the form of rent paid by tenants.





Multi-asset

Standard Life Investments is at the forefront of multi-asset investing, developing innovative products that aim to deliver targeted returns within tight risk boundaries. As a result, increasing numbers of investors trust us with their investments.

Equities



Excellence in equities
Standard Life Investments manages a full range of equity strategies that span the risk/return spectrum. While distinct in their risk tolerances and return objectives, our equity portfolios share a common goal: to consistently add value through active management.
Our equity investment process combines focused portfolio management with proprietary research and significant firm-wide resources. Much of our success is based on our exceptional team which adheres to our clear philosophy and robust, repeatable investment process. The team maintains comprehensive coverage of global markets and enjoys direct access to company management at the very highest levels.
Our areas of excellence include:

Global equities – our global equities team stands at the heart of the more than 60 portfolio managers/equity analysts working across Standard Life Investments. The team draws on its collective investment insights to build global equity portfolios that include its highest conviction ideas. The team’s mandates encompass core, unconstrained and income-oriented strategies.
UK equities – our highly regarded and well-resourced UK equities team has the full FTSE 350 stock universe under constant research coverage. The team’s investment portfolios span a wide range of strategies, including core, income, unconstrained, high alpha and ethical.
European equities – our European equities team of seasoned investment professionals invests right across the European equity universe. The team manages a broad range of products to suit various investor profiles, including core, income, ethical and unconstrained.
GEM equities – our global emerging markets (GEM) equities mandates are managed by a highly experienced and well-resourced team. These include single country and pan-regional portfolios, deploying core, income and unconstrained strategies.
Smaller companies – our smaller companies team is widely regarded as one of the strongest in the industry. The team scours the under-researched (and under-invested) smaller companies universe to uncover new opportunities to add value to client portfolios, managing UK, European and global mandates.
Japanese equities – our Japanese equity portfolios are managed by our strategic alliance partner Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank (SuMi TRUST), the largest asset manager in Japan. We believe that this on-the-ground presence provides a critical edge when investing in Japan’s equity markets.
North American equities – our high-calibre team in Boston invests in the US equities markets respectively, managing a wide range of active North American mandates.

The UK Stewardship Code



The UK Stewardship Code - Compliance and Contacts
Standard Life Investments is a strong supporter of the principles of good stewardship that are set out in the Stewardship Code published by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2010, and updated in September 2012. We believe that it is mutually beneficial for companies and long-term investors such as Standard Life Investments to have a relationship based on accountability, engagement and trust. Such a relationship helps to ensure that each has a good understanding of the other's views and expectations and it enables us to exercise constructive influence as and when appropriate. We believe that this serves to enhance the long-term value of our clients' investments and to protect their interests when necessary.
Likewise, it is very important that we are accountable to our clients for our stewardship of their assets. Accordingly, we seek to have a transparent and open dialogue with them about how we engage with the companies in their portfolios. Their feedback helps to shape our views and approach.
We are signatories to the Stewardship Code. We comply fully with all the Code's principles in respect of our UK equity investments, as described in the links below. We shall continue to take steps to strengthen our stewardship capabilities in line with the Code in respect of our European equity investments. We shall also use our best endeavours to apply the spirit of the Code's principles in respect of our other global equity investments on a case-by-case basis.

Principle 1 – How we discharge our stewardship responsibilities
Principle 2 – Our policy for managing conflicts of interests
Principle 3 – How we monitor our investee companies
Principle 4 – Our guidelines for escalating engagement
Principle 5 – Our willingness to act collectively with other investors
Principle 6 – Our policy on voting and voting disclosure
Principle 7 – How we report on stewardship to our clients
