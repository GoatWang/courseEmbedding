Group Purchasing
Experience Peerless Purchasing Power


The basic objective of a Group Purchasing Organization (“GPO”) is to increase the negotiating strength of each individual member.   By combining the purchase volume of all of its members, a GPO is able to negotiate significant volume discounts and low prices that an individual member could not achieve on its volume alone.  Regardless of the size of your business, HPSI’s unequalled purchasing power will save you money.
As an HPSI member, you will quickly discover that HPSI is peerless not only in purchasing power, but also in service.  Upon joining HPSI, you’ll receive a purchasing solution that is custom-designed to suit your business needs.  Your local HPSI purchasing consultant will assist you with on-site consultations, as well as personalized training for maximum program benefits. Plus you’ll have unlimited access to an entire team of purchasing experts.  Material managers, contract specialists, customer service agents, and registered dietitians are only a toll-free call away to assist with any need or question.
But the benefits don’t end there.  Over the years, HPSI has developed a multitude of additional services and programs to help your business become more profitable and efficient. The HPSI Prudent Buyer Report  is an easy-to-read, monthly analysis of all your program purchases and pricing.  The HPSI Loyalty Rewards Program allows you to qualify for and receive substantial manufacturers’ allowances typically available to only the largest volume purchasers.  And Menu2UPlus.com provides all the tools you’ll need to create an exceptional dining program for your residents. 
Just pick up the phone and give us a call.  We’ll show you just how easy it is to improve your bottom line.  In fact, we guarantee it!

Healthcare

No One Does It Better 
Beginning with just four Southern California hospitals in 1964, HPSI’s healthcare membership has grown to over 9,300 satisfied nursing homes, assisted living facilities, residential care homes, skilled care facilities, independent living communities, retirement communities and other senior care providers.
HPSI’s phenomenal growth has been fueled by a relentless desire to offer easy access and low discount pricing on virtually every product and service needed by an HPSI member. HPSI’s comprehensive contract portfolio includes products and services in dietary, medical, housekeeping, linen, office supplies, ware washing, pest control, capital equipment, and furnishings. Check out our entire product list by clicking here.
However, accessibility and pricing  are only part of the HPSI formula. From the outset, HPSI has been committed to local, personalized and ongoing customer service. Michaele Simas, Director of Purchasing for Covenant Care Corporation described her experience with HPSI as follows:
"If every vendor partner were like HPSI, our lives would be perfect. HPSI has the most dedicated support team from their inside staff to their outside sales team. They are always there when we need them and they always step up to the plate and go the extra mile for us. They know and understand the special needs of the LTC industry and they understand the challenges that we face in LTC. They are always working to develop new programs to help our facilities be more efficient and at the same time save us dollars at the end of the day."
