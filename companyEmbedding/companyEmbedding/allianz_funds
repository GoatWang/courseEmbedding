What Local Florida Realtors are saying about R P Funding:

"We have been blown away with the attention to detail and the efficiency that RP funding has provided our clients. Most of the time it is like pulling teeth with folks in the mortgage industry. RP has simplified everything letting me as a realtor and my clients breathe a little bit easier. I will recommend all of my clients to use RP Funding, hands down." 

Lee Goldberg
		Realtor
		GCI Realty, Inc
		Orlando, Florida

"During the government's &dollar;8,000 home buying credit program, I was the listing agent for a single family home in the BVL area; the buyer had been diligently trying to secure his loan, but 10 days before the closing a last minute over-site by his chosen lender made him ineligible for their loan product and the buyer's agent had no back-up. I suggested to the buyer's agent that the buyer contact RP Funding to review the buyer's qualifications, before they just walked away. RP Funding came through; saving the sale by qualifying the buyer, saving his $8,000 credit and closing the deal on time. Result: all parties to the transaction (buyer, seller and agents) were very happy.
		
Thanks RP!!!"
		
Daniel J. Lopez
		Sales Agent
		Hometown Realty Group, Inc

"I discovered RP Funding through an email advertisement I received.	After looking at their website
		and speaking with Brandon Fields about their low closing costs, 10 day closings, and $1,000
		guarantee, I was anxious to give RP Funding a try.	I sent Brandon a client on Dec. 8th to get pre-
		approved and had a FULL loan approval by Dec. 17th.	Amazing!	Brandon Fields and his
		processor Jill Hoyle are fabulous to work with and they have definitely earned my business.
		RP Funding is the only place I will send my clients from now on!!"

Direct Mortgage Lender - Not a Bank and Not a Broker

The big banks are so backed up with refinances, many raised their rates to slow down volume. 
To a big bank you are just a number, and will most likely work with an out of state call center. 
Mortgage broker fees raise the cost of your refinance, as a Direct Lender you pay no Broker Fees.
We have the authority to underwrite and close your loan, and we do it in as little as 10 days right here in Orlando, Florida. †
Mortgage Rates in Florida will not stay this low for long, and with our fast process you can get in before it's too late.




No Games, No Pushy Sales People and BBB A-Rated
Most mortgage loan officers are paid commission and make extra money by selling you a higher interest
	rate, not here. We don't have pushy commission sales people, you will work directly with a Salaried Credit
	Manager who's only concern is earning your business, not making their next big commission check.
	This helps us keep our rates and fees low.
Based Locally in the Central FL area
Our office is just off of Interstate 4, Exit 90B in Maitland, Florida, just outside of Orlando. We would
	love to meet you in person, although you are welcome to complete the entire process over the phone,
	it's completely up to you.  We help home buyers and home owners all over Florida.
&dollar;1,000 "Best Florida Mortgage Rates" Guarantee
If you find a better loan somewhere else (which we doubt you can) and we can't beat it, we will give
	you a &dollar;1,000 Visa Gift Card.*

* $1,000 Mortgage Challenge/Guarantee requires a minimum loan amount of $100,000 and applies to Fixed Rate Loans only. This Challenge/Guarantee is not applicable to Jumbo Loans, which are loans for $424,100 and greater, and does not apply if borrower is declined by R P Funding for not meeting credit or income program guidelines. Borrower must provide Loan Estimate Disclosure to R P Funding from competing lender on the same day the competitor's terms are offered. Loan program offered by competitor must be a program R P Funding currently offers. This offer does not apply to prior locks or terms, and R P Funding must have an opportunity to beat the terms. In the event that R P Funding is unable to beat the terms of the competing lender, borrower must provide the final executed Closing disclosure, the first page of mortgage note after closing and funding, and the lock-in agreement dated the same day terms are presented to R P Funding, all of which will be used to verify competing lender's terms have not changed at closing. The $1,000 Mortgage Challenge/Guarantee is not applicable if the loan closes on terms different than those detailed in the Loan Estimate Disclosure provided to R P Funding. Change in terms include, but are not limited to, changes in loan amount, loan program, fees, discounts, lender credits, rate, APR, buy-downs, years of term, origination, down payment, seller or any interested party credits, and within the time of the competitor's initial lock in, or any other material loan changes not specifically mentioned here.

Basics



Save for future qualified higher education expenses in tax-advantaged accounts by Virginia529.




Career aspirations vary, but all require training and education. Paying for this out of pocket can be a challenge, and loans can saddle you or your child with substantial debt. 
Fortunately, saving with Virginia529 lets time and planning work to your advantage.



Plan now to meet tomorrow’s education needs



The Cost of Waiting 1



The sooner you start, the more your savings can grow. Saving $100 a month, for example, could yield nearly $40,000 after 18 years. 1
Delaying, on the other hand, can be costly. In the example, waiting one year to begin saving could reduce your account by $4,000. Delaying five years could cost you $16,000 in growth.

See more benefits to help choose








You can open an account with as little as $25 and save at your own pace through a choice of three programs:





            Tuition program
          






                Prepay semesters of college tuition and redeem them in the future at your choice of institution
              


For tuition and mandatory fees



            Savings programs
          






                Save at your own pace through options ranging from an FDIC-insured bank savings account to investment portfolios
              






                Work with your financial advisor to reach your savings goals
              

For any qualified higher education expense, including tuition, room and board, textbooks, computers, required supplies and equipment

Benefits












The money you save is always yours
Should plans change – if your student receives a scholarship or doesn’t pursue higher education – the money you saved is still yours. You can reserve the money for graduate school, transfer the account to a member of the family without penalty or withdraw the funds (non-qualified distributions may incur certain tax payments and penalties).

 





It’s not just for college
Virginia529 accounts can fund many qualified higher education expenses for eligible four-year colleges, two-year colleges, graduate schools, trade schools and training programs!

 





In state, out of state, public or private … go anywhere!
Use your Virginia529 account at an eligible educational institution around the country – or even the world. Plus, accounts are flexible and can fund qualified higher education expenses at public or private colleges.

 





Help from others
Family – including grandparents – and friends can give the gift of education by contributing to your Virginia529 account. 

 





Tax savings
Save for education and save on your taxes. Earnings grow free from state and federal taxes and are never taxed when used for qualified higher education expenses. Plus, Virginia taxpayers may deduct up to $4,000 per account per year from their Virginia state individual income taxes.

Benefits of Tax-Free Earning  1, 2


Virginia529 account tax benefits

 





Save for yourself
Virginia529 accounts are open to all ages. While Prepaid529 has age limitations and a limited enrollment period, Invest529 and CollegeAmerica can be opened at any time for anyone – even adults.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Allianz investment options
    



Allianz variable annuities provide variable investment options that allow you to participate in the market. By diversifying your investments, you can help even out the market ups and downs. However, diversification means more than just putting your money into many different investment options. You should take into consideration the asset classes and money managers that may be appropriate for your personal investment goals. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.

Investing in a variable annuity may be the answer for part of your overall retirement strategy. A variable annuity offers a unique combination of features, including market participation through a variety of investment options; tax-deferred growth opportunities; and optional protection benefits that can provide certain accumulation, income, and beneficiary guarantees for an additional cost. Please note that we no longer offer any variable life insurance products.
Variable annuities and variable life insurance products are subject to investment risk, including loss of principal, and contract/policy values fluctuate daily. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions so that units, upon distribution, may be worth more or less than the original cost.

Please read the prospectuses thoroughly before sending money.
Guarantees are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company. Variable annuity and variable life insurance guarantees do not apply to the performance of the variable subaccounts, which will fluctuate with market conditions.

ABCs of annuities


Allianz Answers


Fixed index annuities


Variable annuities


Index variable annuities 


Variable investment options















Annuities
Simply put, an annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company: You pay the insurance company premium or purchase payments, and in exchange you get benefits only an annuity can provide.







 





Annuity questions?
Allianz Answers.











Why consider an annuity?
Annuities can be a valuable addition to your overall retirement strategy because they offer tax-deferred growth potential while you’re saving for retirement, and dependable income after you retire – in some cases, for as long as you live.
Many annuities provide principal protection from market downturns, lifetime income, an enhanced death benefit, and other options, either built-in or optional and available for an additional cost. Plus, annuities can help you transfer wealth to your beneficiaries.


Learn the ABCs of annuities:



 













Which annuity may meet your needs?
Because no two people have the same needs or goals, Allianz offers several types of annuities. Ask your financial professional which annuity may make sense for your individual situation.







 








Fixed index annuities




offer a level of protection and potential interest based on positive changes in an external index, but without actually participating in the market.
 More about fixed index annuities 






 








Variable annuities




give you the possibility of greater potential returns based on the variable investment options you choose, but they will experience market ups and downs – so you could lose money, including principal.
 More about variable annuities 






 








Index variable annuities





allow you to participate in market gains – with a level of protection against market downturns.
More about index variable annuities






Annuities are complex products that include many features and factors. It is important to understand the balance between all features available with any annuity. You should consult with a financial professional to determine if an annuity is appropriate for your needs.
  Need help finding a financial professional? 
The company behind the annuity matters. Why Allianz? 
The guarantees provided by an annuity are backed solely by the insurance company that issues the annuity. Since 1896, we've had the strength and stability to fulfill our promises. Through bull markets and bear markets, we've stayed true to our careful planning, disciplined investing, and risk management expertise. That's why we're well positioned for what's ahead.

What Local Florida Realtors are saying about R P Funding:

"We have been blown away with the attention to detail and the efficiency that RP funding has provided our clients. Most of the time it is like pulling teeth with folks in the mortgage industry. RP has simplified everything letting me as a realtor and my clients breathe a little bit easier. I will recommend all of my clients to use RP Funding, hands down." 

Lee Goldberg
		Realtor
		GCI Realty, Inc
		Orlando, Florida

"During the government's &dollar;8,000 home buying credit program, I was the listing agent for a single family home in the BVL area; the buyer had been diligently trying to secure his loan, but 10 days before the closing a last minute over-site by his chosen lender made him ineligible for their loan product and the buyer's agent had no back-up. I suggested to the buyer's agent that the buyer contact RP Funding to review the buyer's qualifications, before they just walked away. RP Funding came through; saving the sale by qualifying the buyer, saving his $8,000 credit and closing the deal on time. Result: all parties to the transaction (buyer, seller and agents) were very happy.
		
Thanks RP!!!"
		
Daniel J. Lopez
		Sales Agent
		Hometown Realty Group, Inc

"I discovered RP Funding through an email advertisement I received.	After looking at their website
		and speaking with Brandon Fields about their low closing costs, 10 day closings, and $1,000
		guarantee, I was anxious to give RP Funding a try.	I sent Brandon a client on Dec. 8th to get pre-
		approved and had a FULL loan approval by Dec. 17th.	Amazing!	Brandon Fields and his
		processor Jill Hoyle are fabulous to work with and they have definitely earned my business.
		RP Funding is the only place I will send my clients from now on!!"

Direct Mortgage Lender - Not a Bank and Not a Broker

The big banks are so backed up with refinances, many raised their rates to slow down volume. 
To a big bank you are just a number, and will most likely work with an out of state call center. 
Mortgage broker fees raise the cost of your refinance, as a Direct Lender you pay no Broker Fees.
We have the authority to underwrite and close your loan, and we do it in as little as 10 days right here in Orlando, Florida. †
Mortgage Rates in Florida will not stay this low for long, and with our fast process you can get in before it's too late.




No Games, No Pushy Sales People and BBB A-Rated
Most mortgage loan officers are paid commission and make extra money by selling you a higher interest
	rate, not here. We don't have pushy commission sales people, you will work directly with a Salaried Credit
	Manager who's only concern is earning your business, not making their next big commission check.
	This helps us keep our rates and fees low.
Based Locally in the Central FL area
Our office is just off of Interstate 4, Exit 90B in Maitland, Florida, just outside of Orlando. We would
	love to meet you in person, although you are welcome to complete the entire process over the phone,
	it's completely up to you.  We help home buyers and home owners all over Florida.
&dollar;1,000 "Best Florida Mortgage Rates" Guarantee
If you find a better loan somewhere else (which we doubt you can) and we can't beat it, we will give
	you a &dollar;1,000 Visa Gift Card.*

In the event that R P Funding is unable to beat the terms of the competing lender, borrower must provide the final executed Closing disclosure, the first page of mortgage note after closing and funding, and the lock-in agreement dated the same day terms are presented to R P Funding, all of which will be used to verify competing lender's terms have not changed at closing. The $1,000 Mortgage Challenge/Guarantee is not applicable if the loan closes on terms different than those detailed in the Loan Estimate Disclosure provided to R P Funding. Change in terms include, but are not limited to, changes in loan amount, loan program, fees, discounts, lender credits, rate, APR, buy-downs, years of term, origination, down payment, seller or any interested party credits, and within the time of the competitor's initial lock in, or any other material loan changes not specifically mentioned here.

Basics



Save for future qualified higher education expenses in tax-advantaged accounts by Virginia529.




Career aspirations vary, but all require training and education. Paying for this out of pocket can be a challenge, and loans can saddle you or your child with substantial debt. 
Fortunately, saving with Virginia529 lets time and planning work to your advantage.



Plan now to meet tomorrow’s education needs



The Cost of Waiting 1



The sooner you start, the more your savings can grow. Saving $100 a month, for example, could yield nearly $40,000 after 18 years. 1
Delaying, on the other hand, can be costly. In the example, waiting one year to begin saving could reduce your account by $4,000. Delaying five years could cost you $16,000 in growth.

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]




An early Allianz agent's plaque.


Allianz AG was founded in Berlin on 5 February 1890 by then director of the Munich Reinsurance Company Carl von Thieme (a native of Erfurt, whose father was the director of Thuringia) and Wilhelm von Finck (co-owner of the Merck Finck & Co bank). The joint company was listed in Berlin's trade register[6] under the name Allianz Versicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft.[7] The first Allianz products were marine and accident policies first sold only in Germany, however in 1893 Allianz opened its first international branch office in London. It distributed marine insurance coverage to German clientele looking for coverage abroad.[8]
In 1900 the company became the first insurer to obtain a license to distribute corporate policies. In 1904 Paul Von Naher took over the sole leadership of the company, as it moved into the US and other markets. Markets entered by 1914 included the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, France, the Scandinavian countries and the Baltic States, and Allianz had become the largest maritime insurer in Germany.[8] The company suffered an early disaster in expansion, when the 1906 San Francisco earthquake caused the company to sustain 300,000 marks in losses. In 1905 the company acquired Fides Insurance Company, a firm that had innovated the first form of home invasion insurance.[9] Other places it would expand into during the 1910s and 1920s included Palestine, Cyprus, Iraq, China, the Dutch Indies, Ceylon, and Siam.[10]
20th century developments[edit]
In 1905 the company began to offer fire insurance, and in 1911 it began to sell machinery breakdown policies. Allianz remained the only company in the world that sold machine breakdown insurance until 1924. Then in 1918 it began to offer automobile insurance as well. In 1921 Von Naher died and was succeeded by Kurt Schmitt. The company would begin to offer life insurance as of 1922, becoming Europe's largest offerer of the policies by the end of the 1920s.
In 1927 Allianz merged with Stuttgarter Verein Versicherung AG and [8] two years later acquired the insurance businesses of Favag, a large German insurer that declared bankruptcy due to the onset of the Great Depression.[11] Expansion of the company then slowed until 1938[12] at which point it employed more than 24,000 people.[13] Christian Stadler wrote of the history of Allianz that it "shows how important it is to diversify into related areas to hedge against the risk of fundamental changes in markets and economies".[14]
During World War II the Berlin headquarters of Allianz were destroyed by Allied bombing runs.[15] Following the end of the war in 1945, Hans Heß became head of the company, and Allianz shifted its headquarters to Munich in 1949 due to the split between East and West Germany. Heß only held the position until 1948, when he was replaced by Hans Goudefroy. After World War II, global business activities were gradually resumed. Allianz opened an office in Paris in 1959, and started repurchasing stakes in former subsidiaries in Italy and Austria. In 1971 Wolfgang Schieren became the head of the company.
These expansions were followed in the 1970s by the establishment of business in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Brazil and the United States. In 1986, Allianz acquired Cornhill Insurance PLC, London, and the purchase of a stake in Riunione Adriatica di Sicurità (RAS), Milan, strengthened its presence in Western and Southern Europe in the 1980s.
In 1990, Allianz started an expansion into eight Eastern European countries with establishing a presence in Hungary. In the same decade, Allianz also acquired Fireman's Fund, an insurer in the United States, which was followed by the purchase of Assurances Générales de France (AGF), Paris. These acquisitions were followed by the expansion into Asia with several joint ventures and acquisitions in China and South Korea and the acquisition of Australia's Manufacturers Mutual Insurance. Around this time Allianz expanded its asset management business as well by purchasing for example asset management companies in California.[8]
21st century developments[edit]

Allianz's current head office is located in Munich.


In April 2001, Allianz agreed to acquire the 80 per cent of Dresdner Bank that it did not already own for US$20 billion. As part of the transaction, Allianz agreed to sell its 13.5 per cent stake in HypoVereinsbank to Munich Re, and to acquire Munich Re's 40 per cent stake in Allianz Leben.[16] Following completion of the acquisition, Allianz and Dresdner Bank combined their asset management activities by forming Allianz Global Investors. In 2002, Michael Diekmann succeeded Henning Schulte-Noelle as CEO of Allianz AG. In June 2006, Allianz announced the layoff of 7,280 employees, about 4 percent of its worldwide work force at the time, as part of a restructuring program aimed at raising profitability. The reductions comprised 5,000 staff at Allianz insurance operations and 2,480 at Dresdner Bank. In the same month, Allianz announced that its Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein investment banking operation would be renamed as simply Dresdner Kleinwort.[17]
In September 2005, Allianz announced that it would convert its holding company into a Societas Europaea (SE; Latin: European Company), becoming one of the first major companies to do so. The conversion was made in conjunction with Allianz's acquisition of 100 per cent control of its principal Italian subsidiary Riunione Adriatica di Sicurtà (RAS) for around US$7 billion. The conversion to an SE was completed on 13 October 2006.[18] The Allianz Group also simplified its brand strategy from 2006 and their previous emblem was replaced by the current combination mark.[19] By 2008 the company was Europe's largest insurer.[20]
In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[21]
On 31 August 2008, it was announced that Allianz had agreed to sell 60.2 per cent of Dresdner Bank to Commerzbank for €9.8 billion (US$14.4 billion), with an agreement that Commerzbank would acquire the remainder of Dresdner Bank by the end of 2009.[22] After renegotiations, it was announced in November 2008 that Commerzbank would acquire the 100% ownership of Dresdner Bank earlier (12 January 2009). The sale price was lowered to 5.5 billion Euro. Shortly after the transaction completed, Commerzbank was partially nationalized by the German government to save it from bankruptcy. Allianz currently retains a stake of around 14% in Commerzbank.[23]
In August 2015, a consortium led by Allianz acquired German motorway service station group Tank&Rast for an undisclosed sum believed to be in the region of €3.5 billion.[24]
Operations[edit]
Allianz has operations in over 70 countries and has around 147,000 employees. The parent company, Allianz SE, is headquartered in Munich, Germany. Allianz has more than 85 million customers worldwide and its services include property and casualty insurance, life and health insurance and asset management.[15] In 2013 it was number 25 on the global Forbes 2000 list.[25]

Sponsorships[edit]




Allianz has been a key sponsor of Formula One since 2000.






The Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany.


Allianz provided naming rights for the Allianz Arena, a football stadium in the north of Munich, Germany. The two professional Munich football clubs Bayern Munich and TSV 1860 München have played their home games at Allianz Arena since the start of the 2005–06 season.[48] Other stadiums associated with Allianz include the Allianz Parque soccer stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Allianz Riviera soccer stadium in Nice, France, the Allianz Park rugby stadium in London, UK, the Allianz Stadium soccer stadium in Turin, Italy, the Allianz Stadion soccer stadium in Vienna, Austria, the Allianz Stadium in Moor Park, Australia and the under construction Allianz Field soccer stadium in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Allianz had been in negotiations with the New York Jets and the Giants to buy naming rights to the New Meadowlands Stadium (now known as MetLife Stadium) in East Rutherford, New Jersey, but those talks ended due to opposition from Jewish groups and Holocaust survivors.[49]
Allianz owned the Polish football team Gornik Zabrze but sold its shares in the club in April 2011.[50] Allianz has been involved in Formula One since 2000, firstly as a sponsor of the AT&T Williams F1 Team,[51] and since 2011 as a sponsor of the Mercedes GP Petronas team.[52] In 2009 Allianz signed an agreement to become the Global Partner of the St. Andrews Links Trust.[53] In early 2012, Allianz entered an agreement with the Sydney Cricket & Sports Ground Trust which oversaw the Sydney Football Stadium being renamed Allianz Stadium.[54] 2012 also saw Allianz partner up with Saracens to be their main shirt sponsor as well as securing an £8m deal for naming rights to their new Barnet Copthall home to be called Allianz Park.[55]
The company has also been the sponsor of others sports, including the Women’s British Open (golf), Allianz Open de Lyon (golf), Allianz Championship (golf), Allianz Golf Open du Grand Toulouse (golf), Allianz Suisse Open Gstaad (tennis), Allianz Cup (tennis), Allianz Championship (golf), La Liga (football), Premier League (football) and FINA Swimming World Cup (swimming) events.[56][57][58]
In Ireland, the national Gaelic Football league is officially named the Allianz National Football League.
Nazi-era activities and litigation[edit]




The former Allianz Head Office in Berlin.


In 1993 Henning Schulte-Noelle commissioned a new Archive for Corporate History, becoming the first Allianz CEO to address the company's activities during the Third Reich. In 1997 Schulte-Noelle asked Gerald Feldman, historian from the University of California-Berkeley, if he would undertake a larger research project on Allianz's past involvement with the Third Reich.[59] After research began, Jewish World War II survivors and their descendants took Allianz and other European insurance companies to court, accusing them of unpaid insurance policies.[60] Allianz and four other insurers supported the creation of the "International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims" (ICHEIC).[61]
Furthermore, Allianz became a founding member of the German Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility and Future".[62] Feldman published the comprehensive results of his research in September 2001. Based on these results Allianz established an exhibition in the Archive for Corporate History and on the Internet.[63] The research concluded that Allianz, as an organization and through its corporate officers, voluntarily partnered with the Nazi Regime and the Third Reich, starting as early as the early 1930s and continuing all the way through to the collapse of the Third Reich.[64]
Feldman summarized his findings stating: "It was just one more piece of business in the Third Reich, but it demonstrated that such pieces on any large scale made contact at some point with all that is represented by the name "Auschwitz" – from slave labor to extermination – virtually inescapable." They were recorded in a book published by Cambridge University Press.[65]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]




An early Allianz agent's plaque.


Allianz AG was founded in Berlin on 5 February 1890 by then director of the Munich Reinsurance Company Carl von Thieme (a native of Erfurt, whose father was the director of Thuringia) and Wilhelm von Finck (co-owner of the Merck Finck & Co bank). The joint company was listed in Berlin's trade register[6] under the name Allianz Versicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft.[7] The first Allianz products were marine and accident policies first sold only in Germany, however in 1893 Allianz opened its first international branch office in London. It distributed marine insurance coverage to German clientele looking for coverage abroad.[8]
In 1900 the company became the first insurer to obtain a license to distribute corporate policies. In 1904 Paul Von Naher took over the sole leadership of the company, as it moved into the US and other markets. Markets entered by 1914 included the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, France, the Scandinavian countries and the Baltic States, and Allianz had become the largest maritime insurer in Germany.[8] The company suffered an early disaster in expansion, when the 1906 San Francisco earthquake caused the company to sustain 300,000 marks in losses. In 1905 the company acquired Fides Insurance Company, a firm that had innovated the first form of home invasion insurance.[9] Other places it would expand into during the 1910s and 1920s included Palestine, Cyprus, Iraq, China, the Dutch Indies, Ceylon, and Siam.[10]
20th century developments[edit]
In 1905 the company began to offer fire insurance, and in 1911 it began to sell machinery breakdown policies. Allianz remained the only company in the world that sold machine breakdown insurance until 1924. Then in 1918 it began to offer automobile insurance as well. In 1921 Von Naher died and was succeeded by Kurt Schmitt. The company would begin to offer life insurance as of 1922, becoming Europe's largest offerer of the policies by the end of the 1920s.
In 1927 Allianz merged with Stuttgarter Verein Versicherung AG and [8] two years later acquired the insurance businesses of Favag, a large German insurer that declared bankruptcy due to the onset of the Great Depression.[11] Expansion of the company then slowed until 1938[12] at which point it employed more than 24,000 people.[13] Christian Stadler wrote of the history of Allianz that it "shows how important it is to diversify into related areas to hedge against the risk of fundamental changes in markets and economies".[14]
During World War II the Berlin headquarters of Allianz were destroyed by Allied bombing runs.[15] Following the end of the war in 1945, Hans Heß became head of the company, and Allianz shifted its headquarters to Munich in 1949 due to the split between East and West Germany. Heß only held the position until 1948, when he was replaced by Hans Goudefroy. After World War II, global business activities were gradually resumed. Allianz opened an office in Paris in 1959, and started repurchasing stakes in former subsidiaries in Italy and Austria. In 1971 Wolfgang Schieren became the head of the company.
These expansions were followed in the 1970s by the establishment of business in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Brazil and the United States. In 1986, Allianz acquired Cornhill Insurance PLC, London, and the purchase of a stake in Riunione Adriatica di Sicurità (RAS), Milan, strengthened its presence in Western and Southern Europe in the 1980s.
In 1990, Allianz started an expansion into eight Eastern European countries with establishing a presence in Hungary. In the same decade, Allianz also acquired Fireman's Fund, an insurer in the United States, which was followed by the purchase of Assurances Générales de France (AGF), Paris. These acquisitions were followed by the expansion into Asia with several joint ventures and acquisitions in China and South Korea and the acquisition of Australia's Manufacturers Mutual Insurance. Around this time Allianz expanded its asset management business as well by purchasing for example asset management companies in California.[8]
21st century developments[edit]

Allianz's current head office is located in Munich.


In April 2001, Allianz agreed to acquire the 80 per cent of Dresdner Bank that it did not already own for US$20 billion. As part of the transaction, Allianz agreed to sell its 13.5 per cent stake in HypoVereinsbank to Munich Re, and to acquire Munich Re's 40 per cent stake in Allianz Leben.[16] Following completion of the acquisition, Allianz and Dresdner Bank combined their asset management activities by forming Allianz Global Investors. In 2002, Michael Diekmann succeeded Henning Schulte-Noelle as CEO of Allianz AG. In June 2006, Allianz announced the layoff of 7,280 employees, about 4 percent of its worldwide work force at the time, as part of a restructuring program aimed at raising profitability. The reductions comprised 5,000 staff at Allianz insurance operations and 2,480 at Dresdner Bank. In the same month, Allianz announced that its Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein investment banking operation would be renamed as simply Dresdner Kleinwort.[17]
In September 2005, Allianz announced that it would convert its holding company into a Societas Europaea (SE; Latin: European Company), becoming one of the first major companies to do so. The conversion was made in conjunction with Allianz's acquisition of 100 per cent control of its principal Italian subsidiary Riunione Adriatica di Sicurtà (RAS) for around US$7 billion. The conversion to an SE was completed on 13 October 2006.[18] The Allianz Group also simplified its brand strategy from 2006 and their previous emblem was replaced by the current combination mark.[19] By 2008 the company was Europe's largest insurer.[20]
In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[21]
On 31 August 2008, it was announced that Allianz had agreed to sell 60.2 per cent of Dresdner Bank to Commerzbank for €9.8 billion (US$14.4 billion), with an agreement that Commerzbank would acquire the remainder of Dresdner Bank by the end of 2009.[22] After renegotiations, it was announced in November 2008 that Commerzbank would acquire the 100% ownership of Dresdner Bank earlier (12 January 2009). The sale price was lowered to 5.5 billion Euro. Shortly after the transaction completed, Commerzbank was partially nationalized by the German government to save it from bankruptcy. Allianz currently retains a stake of around 14% in Commerzbank.[23]
In August 2015, a consortium led by Allianz acquired German motorway service station group Tank&Rast for an undisclosed sum believed to be in the region of €3.5 billion.[24]
Operations[edit]
Allianz has operations in over 70 countries and has around 147,000 employees. The parent company, Allianz SE, is headquartered in Munich, Germany. Allianz has more than 85 million customers worldwide and its services include property and casualty insurance, life and health insurance and asset management.[15] In 2013 it was number 25 on the global Forbes 2000 list.[25]

The Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany.


Allianz provided naming rights for the Allianz Arena, a football stadium in the north of Munich, Germany. The two professional Munich football clubs Bayern Munich and TSV 1860 München have played their home games at Allianz Arena since the start of the 2005–06 season.[48] Other stadiums associated with Allianz include the Allianz Parque soccer stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Allianz Riviera soccer stadium in Nice, France, the Allianz Park rugby stadium in London, UK, the Allianz Stadium soccer stadium in Turin, Italy, the Allianz Stadion soccer stadium in Vienna, Austria, the Allianz Stadium in Moor Park, Australia and the under construction Allianz Field soccer stadium in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Allianz had been in negotiations with the New York Jets and the Giants to buy naming rights to the New Meadowlands Stadium (now known as MetLife Stadium) in East Rutherford, New Jersey, but those talks ended due to opposition from Jewish groups and Holocaust survivors.[49]
Allianz owned the Polish football team Gornik Zabrze but sold its shares in the club in April 2011.[50] Allianz has been involved in Formula One since 2000, firstly as a sponsor of the AT&T Williams F1 Team,[51] and since 2011 as a sponsor of the Mercedes GP Petronas team.[52] In 2009 Allianz signed an agreement to become the Global Partner of the St. Andrews Links Trust.[53] In early 2012, Allianz entered an agreement with the Sydney Cricket & Sports Ground Trust which oversaw the Sydney Football Stadium being renamed Allianz Stadium.[54] 2012 also saw Allianz partner up with Saracens to be their main shirt sponsor as well as securing an £8m deal for naming rights to their new Barnet Copthall home to be called Allianz Park.[55]
The company has also been the sponsor of others sports, including the Women’s British Open (golf), Allianz Open de Lyon (golf), Allianz Championship (golf), Allianz Golf Open du Grand Toulouse (golf), Allianz Suisse Open Gstaad (tennis), Allianz Cup (tennis), Allianz Championship (golf), La Liga (football), Premier League (football) and FINA Swimming World Cup (swimming) events.[56][57][58]
In Ireland, the national Gaelic Football league is officially named the Allianz National Football League.
Nazi-era activities and litigation[edit]




The former Allianz Head Office in Berlin.


In 1993 Henning Schulte-Noelle commissioned a new Archive for Corporate History, becoming the first Allianz CEO to address the company's activities during the Third Reich. In 1997 Schulte-Noelle asked Gerald Feldman, historian from the University of California-Berkeley, if he would undertake a larger research project on Allianz's past involvement with the Third Reich.[59] After research began, Jewish World War II survivors and their descendants took Allianz and other European insurance companies to court, accusing them of unpaid insurance policies.[60] Allianz and four other insurers supported the creation of the "International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims" (ICHEIC).[61]
Furthermore, Allianz became a founding member of the German Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility and Future".[62] Feldman published the comprehensive results of his research in September 2001. Based on these results Allianz established an exhibition in the Archive for Corporate History and on the Internet.[63] The research concluded that Allianz, as an organization and through its corporate officers, voluntarily partnered with the Nazi Regime and the Third Reich, starting as early as the early 1930s and continuing all the way through to the collapse of the Third Reich.[64]
Feldman summarized his findings stating: "It was just one more piece of business in the Third Reich, but it demonstrated that such pieces on any large scale made contact at some point with all that is represented by the name "Auschwitz" – from slave labor to extermination – virtually inescapable." They were recorded in a book published by Cambridge University Press.[65]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]




An early Allianz agent's plaque.


Allianz AG was founded in Berlin on 5 February 1890 by then director of the Munich Reinsurance Company Carl von Thieme (a native of Erfurt, whose father was the director of Thuringia) and Wilhelm von Finck (co-owner of the Merck Finck & Co bank). The joint company was listed in Berlin's trade register[6] under the name Allianz Versicherungs-Aktiengesellschaft.[7] The first Allianz products were marine and accident policies first sold only in Germany, however in 1893 Allianz opened its first international branch office in London. It distributed marine insurance coverage to German clientele looking for coverage abroad.[8]
In 1900 the company became the first insurer to obtain a license to distribute corporate policies. In 1904 Paul Von Naher took over the sole leadership of the company, as it moved into the US and other markets. Markets entered by 1914 included the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, France, the Scandinavian countries and the Baltic States, and Allianz had become the largest maritime insurer in Germany.[8] The company suffered an early disaster in expansion, when the 1906 San Francisco earthquake caused the company to sustain 300,000 marks in losses. In 1905 the company acquired Fides Insurance Company, a firm that had innovated the first form of home invasion insurance.[9] Other places it would expand into during the 1910s and 1920s included Palestine, Cyprus, Iraq, China, the Dutch Indies, Ceylon, and Siam.[10]
20th century developments[edit]
In 1905 the company began to offer fire insurance, and in 1911 it began to sell machinery breakdown policies. Allianz remained the only company in the world that sold machine breakdown insurance until 1924. Then in 1918 it began to offer automobile insurance as well. In 1921 Von Naher died and was succeeded by Kurt Schmitt. The company would begin to offer life insurance as of 1922, becoming Europe's largest offerer of the policies by the end of the 1920s.
In 1927 Allianz merged with Stuttgarter Verein Versicherung AG and [8] two years later acquired the insurance businesses of Favag, a large German insurer that declared bankruptcy due to the onset of the Great Depression.[11] Expansion of the company then slowed until 1938[12] at which point it employed more than 24,000 people.[13] Christian Stadler wrote of the history of Allianz that it "shows how important it is to diversify into related areas to hedge against the risk of fundamental changes in markets and economies".[14]
During World War II the Berlin headquarters of Allianz were destroyed by Allied bombing runs.[15] Following the end of the war in 1945, Hans Heß became head of the company, and Allianz shifted its headquarters to Munich in 1949 due to the split between East and West Germany. Heß only held the position until 1948, when he was replaced by Hans Goudefroy. After World War II, global business activities were gradually resumed. Allianz opened an office in Paris in 1959, and started repurchasing stakes in former subsidiaries in Italy and Austria. In 1971 Wolfgang Schieren became the head of the company.
These expansions were followed in the 1970s by the establishment of business in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Brazil and the United States. In 1986, Allianz acquired Cornhill Insurance PLC, London, and the purchase of a stake in Riunione Adriatica di Sicurità (RAS), Milan, strengthened its presence in Western and Southern Europe in the 1980s.
In 1990, Allianz started an expansion into eight Eastern European countries with establishing a presence in Hungary. In the same decade, Allianz also acquired Fireman's Fund, an insurer in the United States, which was followed by the purchase of Assurances Générales de France (AGF), Paris. These acquisitions were followed by the expansion into Asia with several joint ventures and acquisitions in China and South Korea and the acquisition of Australia's Manufacturers Mutual Insurance. Around this time Allianz expanded its asset management business as well by purchasing for example asset management companies in California.[8]
21st century developments[edit]




The original Allianz logo, designed in 1923 by Karl Schulpig.






Allianz's current head office is located in Munich.


In April 2001, Allianz agreed to acquire the 80 per cent of Dresdner Bank that it did not already own for US$20 billion. As part of the transaction, Allianz agreed to sell its 13.5 per cent stake in HypoVereinsbank to Munich Re, and to acquire Munich Re's 40 per cent stake in Allianz Leben.[16] Following completion of the acquisition, Allianz and Dresdner Bank combined their asset management activities by forming Allianz Global Investors. In 2002, Michael Diekmann succeeded Henning Schulte-Noelle as CEO of Allianz AG. In June 2006, Allianz announced the layoff of 7,280 employees, about 4 percent of its worldwide work force at the time, as part of a restructuring program aimed at raising profitability. The reductions comprised 5,000 staff at Allianz insurance operations and 2,480 at Dresdner Bank. In the same month, Allianz announced that its Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein investment banking operation would be renamed as simply Dresdner Kleinwort.[17]
In September 2005, Allianz announced that it would convert its holding company into a Societas Europaea (SE; Latin: European Company), becoming one of the first major companies to do so. The conversion was made in conjunction with Allianz's acquisition of 100 per cent control of its principal Italian subsidiary Riunione Adriatica di Sicurtà (RAS) for around US$7 billion. The conversion to an SE was completed on 13 October 2006.[18] The Allianz Group also simplified its brand strategy from 2006 and their previous emblem was replaced by the current combination mark.[19] By 2008 the company was Europe's largest insurer.[20]
In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[21]
On 31 August 2008, it was announced that Allianz had agreed to sell 60.2 per cent of Dresdner Bank to Commerzbank for €9.8 billion (US$14.4 billion), with an agreement that Commerzbank would acquire the remainder of Dresdner Bank by the end of 2009.[22] After renegotiations, it was announced in November 2008 that Commerzbank would acquire the 100% ownership of Dresdner Bank earlier (12 January 2009). The sale price was lowered to 5.5 billion Euro. Shortly after the transaction completed, Commerzbank was partially nationalized by the German government to save it from bankruptcy. Allianz currently retains a stake of around 14% in Commerzbank.[23]
In August 2015, a consortium led by Allianz acquired German motorway service station group Tank&Rast for an undisclosed sum believed to be in the region of €3.5 billion.[24]
Operations[edit]
Allianz has operations in over 70 countries and has around 147,000 employees. The parent company, Allianz SE, is headquartered in Munich, Germany. Allianz has more than 85 million customers worldwide and its services include property and casualty insurance, life and health insurance and asset management.[15] In 2013 it was number 25 on the global Forbes 2000 list.[25]




Countries in which Allianz currently has operations.


Australia[edit]
Tracing its roots back to 1914, Allianz Australia Insurance Limited operates throughout Australia and New Zealand and through its subsidiaries offers a range of insurance and risk management products and services.[26] Subsidiaries of Allianz Australia include Club Marine, Allianz Life and Hunter Premium Funding.[27] In 2012, Allianz Australia announced a multi-year agreement with the SCG Trust to rename the Sydney Football Stadium to Allianz Stadium.[28] Allianz AG is the underwriter for Australia's largest pet insurance company, Petplan Australia.

Canada[edit]
Allianz entered the Canadian market in the early 1990s through an acquisition of several North American insurers, namely the American Firemans Fund[31] and the Canadian Surety.[32] Upon the market exit the personal and commercial lines unit was sold off to the market leader ING Canada (Now Intact), and Allianz Canada continues operations in Kitchener Ontario. Allianz Canada has also merged with TIC Travel Insurance in 2014 and has become one of the largest insurance companies in Canada as a result.[33][34]
Colombia[edit]
Allianz acquired in 1999 60% of the shares of Colombian insurer Colseguros, 3 years later in 2002 it increases its shareholding, becoming the sole owner of this company in Colombia. After almost 10 years in 2012 and with an evolutionary change of brand Colseguros dies as an official name and the entire operation of Colombia is consolidated under the name of Allianz.[35]

Sponsorships[edit]




Allianz has been a key sponsor of Formula One since 2000.






The Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany.


Allianz provided naming rights for the Allianz Arena, a football stadium in the north of Munich, Germany. The two professional Munich football clubs Bayern Munich and TSV 1860 München have played their home games at Allianz Arena since the start of the 2005–06 season.[48] Other stadiums associated with Allianz include the Allianz Parque soccer stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Allianz Riviera soccer stadium in Nice, France, the Allianz Park rugby stadium in London, UK, the Allianz Stadium soccer stadium in Turin, Italy, the Allianz Stadion soccer stadium in Vienna, Austria, the Allianz Stadium in Moor Park, Australia and the under construction Allianz Field soccer stadium in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Allianz had been in negotiations with the New York Jets and the Giants to buy naming rights to the New Meadowlands Stadium (now known as MetLife Stadium) in East Rutherford, New Jersey, but those talks ended due to opposition from Jewish groups and Holocaust survivors.[49]
Allianz owned the Polish football team Gornik Zabrze but sold its shares in the club in April 2011.[50] Allianz has been involved in Formula One since 2000, firstly as a sponsor of the AT&T Williams F1 Team,[51] and since 2011 as a sponsor of the Mercedes GP Petronas team.[52] In 2009 Allianz signed an agreement to become the Global Partner of the St. Andrews Links Trust.[53] In early 2012, Allianz entered an agreement with the Sydney Cricket & Sports Ground Trust which oversaw the Sydney Football Stadium being renamed Allianz Stadium.[54] 2012 also saw Allianz partner up with Saracens to be their main shirt sponsor as well as securing an £8m deal for naming rights to their new Barnet Copthall home to be called Allianz Park.[55]
The company has also been the sponsor of others sports, including the Women’s British Open (golf), Allianz Open de Lyon (golf), Allianz Championship (golf), Allianz Golf Open du Grand Toulouse (golf), Allianz Suisse Open Gstaad (tennis), Allianz Cup (tennis), Allianz Championship (golf), La Liga (football), Premier League (football) and FINA Swimming World Cup (swimming) events.[56][57][58]
In Ireland, the national Gaelic Football league is officially named the Allianz National Football League.
Nazi-era activities and litigation[edit]




The former Allianz Head Office in Berlin.


In 1993 Henning Schulte-Noelle commissioned a new Archive for Corporate History, becoming the first Allianz CEO to address the company's activities during the Third Reich. In 1997 Schulte-Noelle asked Gerald Feldman, historian from the University of California-Berkeley, if he would undertake a larger research project on Allianz's past involvement with the Third Reich.[59] After research began, Jewish World War II survivors and their descendants took Allianz and other European insurance companies to court, accusing them of unpaid insurance policies.[60] Allianz and four other insurers supported the creation of the "International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims" (ICHEIC).[61]
Furthermore, Allianz became a founding member of the German Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility and Future".[62] Feldman published the comprehensive results of his research in September 2001. Based on these results Allianz established an exhibition in the Archive for Corporate History and on the Internet.[63] The research concluded that Allianz, as an organization and through its corporate officers, voluntarily partnered with the Nazi Regime and the Third Reich, starting as early as the early 1930s and continuing all the way through to the collapse of the Third Reich.[64]
Feldman summarized his findings stating: "It was just one more piece of business in the Third Reich, but it demonstrated that such pieces on any large scale made contact at some point with all that is represented by the name "Auschwitz" – from slave labor to extermination – virtually inescapable." They were recorded in a book published by Cambridge University Press.[65]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
