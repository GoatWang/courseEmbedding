This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

News ReleaseMay 17, 2016

David A. Wolfort elected chair of Ohio University Board of Trustees for 2016-2017 
Trustee David A. Wolfort has been elected chair of the Ohio University Board of Trustees for 2016-2017, succeeding Sandra J. Anderson, whose term ended May 13.
Wolfort, who has served as a trustee since 2008 and is an OHIO alumnus, is the president and chief operating officer of Olympic Steel, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio.
“Being a trustee, and now chair of the Board of Trustees, means a great deal to me,” Wolfort said. “It extends my relationship with Ohio University, which spans over the last 46 years from the first day I entered the Athens Campus as a freshman in 1970.”
In addition to his experience as a student and trustee, Wolfort shares another special relationship with his alma mater – as a Bobcat parent. His daughter, Erica, graduated with a bachelor of fine arts in 2008.
“We never missed a Dads Weekend, Moms Weekend or Parents Weekend,” Wolfort said. “It’s a bond between myself and my daughter that we celebrate. Ohio University provided the vehicle for her to not only extend her passion and education in fine arts, but also was able to give her a full university experience.”
As chair, Wolfort said he will continue to support the work of President McDavis and the Board of Trustees in the areas of affordability and accessibility, teaching and research, the University’s Capital Improvement Plan and the OHIO for Ohio Initiative while ensuring the institution’s financial strength.
As chief operating officer of Olympic Steel, a position he has held since 1995, Wolfort manages all sales, purchasing and operational aspects of the corporation. He also oversees corporate strategic planning, overall marketing initiatives and quality assurance. He was elected president of Olympic Steel in 2001, and serves as a member of the company’s board of directors. He is currently vice-chairman of human resources and a trustee with The Musical Arts Association (Cleveland Orchestra).
Wolfort is a member of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s ITAC 12 Committee, serving his second four-year appointment. He is a previous director of the Metals Service Center Institute (MSCI), past chairman of the MSCI Political Action Committee and past chairman of MSCI’s Government Affairs Committee. 
Wolfort and his wife, Barbara, live in Moreland Hills, Ohio, and have three adult children.
