History[edit]
Company founder Samuel A. Markel formed the Mutual Casualty Association and established the Mutual Casualty Company in Norfolk, Virginia. The company headquarters later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4] Sam Markel’s four sons, Lewis, Irvin, Stanley, and Milton, joined the growing business in the 1930s, and Markel Service, Inc. was created.[5] During this time, Markel was actively involved in efforts to develop safety and other standards aimed at legitimizing the growing bus and trucking industries. Markel also assisted in passing the National Motor Carrier Act of 1935.[4]
By the 1940s, Markel Service, Inc. earned a national following and developed a reputation for industry-leading claims adjusting and safety engineering. American Fidelity & Casualty, a sister company covering fleets of trucks and buses, also became the largest insurer of these risks in the USA.[4] In 1980, the company became an insurance carrier when Essex Insurance Company was incorporated and licensed to write excess and surplus lines business.[6] In 1986, the Markel Corporation was listed on the NASDAQ exchange, with an IPO offered at $8.33 per share. The company’s trading was moved to the NYSE in 1997.[7] Markel gained access to specialty international markets in 2000, when Terra Nova Holdings, Ltd. was acquired and the [London] office opened.[8] Branch offices later opened in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada. With a “permanent capital” investing approach, Markel Ventures acquired AMF Bakery Systems in 2005 and continued to acquire other varied and scalable businesses.[4] With the $3.1 billion acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Markel added two additional insurance divisions, Markel Global and Markel Reinsurance.[9] In 2015, Markel acquired Bermuda-based CATCo, a specialist investment management business; and Markel Ventures announced a majority interest in CapTech.[10]
Today, the company is led by Executive Chairman Alan I. Kirshner,[11] who is one of the authors of the Markel Style.

History[edit]
Company founder Samuel A. Markel formed the Mutual Casualty Association and established the Mutual Casualty Company in Norfolk, Virginia. The company headquarters later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4] Sam Markel’s four sons, Lewis, Irvin, Stanley, and Milton, joined the growing business in the 1930s, and Markel Service, Inc. was created.[5] During this time, Markel was actively involved in efforts to develop safety and other standards aimed at legitimizing the growing bus and trucking industries. Markel also assisted in passing the National Motor Carrier Act of 1935.[4]
By the 1940s, Markel Service, Inc. earned a national following and developed a reputation for industry-leading claims adjusting and safety engineering. American Fidelity & Casualty, a sister company covering fleets of trucks and buses, also became the largest insurer of these risks in the USA.[4] In 1980, the company became an insurance carrier when Essex Insurance Company was incorporated and licensed to write excess and surplus lines business.[6] In 1986, the Markel Corporation was listed on the NASDAQ exchange, with an IPO offered at $8.33 per share. The company’s trading was moved to the NYSE in 1997.[7] Markel gained access to specialty international markets in 2000, when Terra Nova Holdings, Ltd. was acquired and the [London] office opened.[8] Branch offices later opened in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada. With a “permanent capital” investing approach, Markel Ventures acquired AMF Bakery Systems in 2005 and continued to acquire other varied and scalable businesses.[4] With the $3.1 billion acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Markel added two additional insurance divisions, Markel Global and Markel Reinsurance.[9] In 2015, Markel acquired Bermuda-based CATCo, a specialist investment management business; and Markel Ventures announced a majority interest in CapTech.[10]
Today, the company is led by Executive Chairman Alan I. Kirshner,[11] who is one of the authors of the Markel Style.
Timeline[edit]
Beginning in 1930, Markel established Markel Service, a separate company to handle direct and reinsurance of AF&C.[4]
In 1951, the company expanded into Canada by founding Markel Service Canada, Ltd., headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.[4]
In 1959, the national claims division of AF&C became National Claims Service, an independent adjuster that could be contracted by other insurance firms. The Safety Engineering Division also began offering services to other firms.[4]
The company later expanded beyond truck and bus companies, led by the third generation of Markels: Anthony (Vice Chairman), Steve, and Gary.[4]
In 1980, the company founded Essex Insurance Company in Delaware. Essex began as a property insurance company in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, but later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4]
In 1985, Prem Watsa took control of Markel Financial Holdings, a Canadian-based trucking insurance company. Near bankruptcy, Watsa determined it needed a capital injection.[4]
In December 1986, Markel Corp. held its first IPO at $8.33 per share, valuing the company at $15 million. Shares traded on the NASDAQ.[7]
In 1987, Markel reorganized Markel Financial Holdings (Canada) and renamed it Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., short for "fair, friendly acquisitions."[4]
In December 1987, Markel Corp. acquired half of Shand Morahan & Company, an underwriter in Deerfield, Illinois.[12]
In December 1990, Markel completed its acquisition of Shand. As part of the Shand acquisition, Markel Corp. also acquired American Underwriting Managers, an insurance underwriter in Pewaukee, Wisconsin specializing in personal boat and motorcycle insurance.[12]
In 1989, Markel Corp. acquired the Rhulen Agency of Monticello, New York. Rhulen is a specialty insurer for children's summer camps and youth organizations. Rhulen was later moved to Richmond, Virginia, and renamed Markel Insurance Company.[4]
In the Spring of 1997, Markel Corp. trading moved to the NYSE.[7]
In January 2000, Markel Corp. founded Markel Southwest Underwriters in Scottsdale, Arizona after buying the Arizona policies of Acceptance Insurance Company.[13]
In March 2000, Markel Corp. completed the acquisition of Terra Nova (Bermuda) Holdings Ltd.[8]
In October 2009, Elliott Special Risks LP (ESR) was purchased by Markel International, a London-based specialty property and casualty insurer that runs the international operations of Markel Corp.[14]
On May 10, 2010, at the Markel Corp. Annual Meeting, it was reported there would be a new management structure approved by the Board. Alan I. Kirshner would remain Chairman and Chief Executive Officer while Anthony F. Markel and Steven A. Markel would still serve as Vice Chairman. Reporting to them would be a three-member Office of the President. Thomas S. Gayner became President and Chief Investment Officer, while Richard R. Whitt, III and F. Michael Crowley became President and Co-Chief Operating Officers.[15]
In July 2010, Markel Corp. acquired Aspen Holdings, Inc. of Omaha, Nebraska.[16]
In April 2011, Markel (UK) Limited launched Markel Direct, an online direct to customer distribution channel for specialist insurance.[17]
On January 4, 2012, Markel Corp. completed the acquisition of Thompson Insurance Enterprises, a privately held program administrator underwriting multi-line, industry-focused insurance programs.[18]
In February 2012, Markel's Camp Insurance Program joined forces with CampDoc.com, an electronic health record system for camps, to help summer camps reduce risk and liability and to ensure the health and safety of kids while at camp.[19]
In June 2012, Markel Direct expanded product range into charity and community group risks.
In October 2012, Markel purchased Essentia Insurance Company.[20]
On May 1, 2013, Markel Corporation completed its acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited.[21]
On December 17, 2013, the Essentia Insurance Company (Essentia) was rated as "A2" by Moody’s Investor Service.[22]
In June 2016, it was announced that Markel had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[23]

History[edit]
Company founder Samuel A. Markel formed the Mutual Casualty Association and established the Mutual Casualty Company in Norfolk, Virginia. The company headquarters later moved to Richmond, Virginia.[4] Sam Markel’s four sons, Lewis, Irvin, Stanley, and Milton, joined the growing business in the 1930s, and Markel Service, Inc. was created.[5] During this time, Markel was actively involved in efforts to develop safety and other standards aimed at legitimizing the growing bus and trucking industries. Markel also assisted in passing the National Motor Carrier Act of 1935.[4]
By the 1940s, Markel Service, Inc. earned a national following and developed a reputation for industry-leading claims adjusting and safety engineering. American Fidelity & Casualty, a sister company covering fleets of trucks and buses, also became the largest insurer of these risks in the USA.[4] In 1980, the company became an insurance carrier when Essex Insurance Company was incorporated and licensed to write excess and surplus lines business.[6] In 1986, the Markel Corporation was listed on the NASDAQ exchange, with an IPO offered at $8.33 per share. The company’s trading was moved to the NYSE in 1997.[7] Markel gained access to specialty international markets in 2000, when Terra Nova Holdings, Ltd. was acquired and the [London] office opened.[8] Branch offices later opened in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada. With a “permanent capital” investing approach, Markel Ventures acquired AMF Bakery Systems in 2005 and continued to acquire other varied and scalable businesses.[4] With the $3.1 billion acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Markel added two additional insurance divisions, Markel Global and Markel Reinsurance.[9] In 2015, Markel acquired Bermuda-based CATCo, a specialist investment management business; and Markel Ventures announced a majority interest in CapTech.[10]
Today, the company is led by Executive Chairman Alan I. Kirshner,[11] who is one of the authors of the Markel Style.

Experience


As an agent who's an expert in this local area, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise about buying and selling real estate here. It's not the same everywhere, so you need someone you can trust for up-to-date information. I am eager to serve you. Here are some of the things I can do for you:
Find Your Next HomeYou need someone who knows this area inside and out! I can work with you to find the right home at the right price for you, including all the neighborhood amenities that matter - not to mention the essential criteria you have for your ideal home
Sell a HomeWhen it's time to move, you need someone who will advertise your home, show to prospective buyers, negotiate the purchase contract, arrange financing, oversee the inspections, handle all necessary paperwork and supervise the closing. I can take care of everything you need, from start to close.
Consult on Home Selling TacticsOftentimes buyers don't visualize living in your home the way you do. I can make your home attractive to its ideal audience - which can help you get top dollar. Things like staging the home, making repairs or minor improvements, or even simply painting the walls can be the difference between a home resting on the market and one that's sold fast. 



Recommendations



					"I bought my first home using Steven as my realtor. When I got a new job in another city, I used Steven again to sell my home. I am tremendously grateful for having Steven on my side for both of those experiences.

He is professional, experienced, and great at his job. He provides valuable advice when needed and he knows how to set up a good game plan to get you the house you want or to sell the house you have.

I must have been spoiled with all the knowledge and experience that Steven offers, because it wasn’t until I was working with another realtor in the new city I relocated to that I realized how much Steven added to the home buying process. I wish I was able to use him then too.
"
				
   -Michael Ortiz, Client



					""Let Steven Markel help you buy and sell your real estate. If you do exactly what he says, you will be thrilled with the results. We were, and will definately use him again when we decide to sell and buy our next property."  "Steven found us the "perfect" home to meet all our needs in this CRAZY market!"  Thank you Steven!  January 23, 2016"
				
   -Kathy & Mark Levine, Little Elm, TX, Client



					"In my estimation Steven Markel is an excellent resource for residential property dealings. He was a willing, eager and valuable partner in facilitating the sale of my father's house even though I live out of state. I placed a great amount of trust in Steven and I was rewarded. He spearheaded the efforts to rehab the property and did a wonderful job organizing labor, coordinating aesthetics, and bringing the property to its most desirable state.

I have found him to be experienced, knowledgeable and trustworthy. His professionalism, pragmatism and honesty are refreshing.

I would highly recommend Steven Markel to anyone interested in having a positive real estate experience.   October 9, 2013"
