History[edit]
2002 to 2006[edit]
Entrepreneurs Niraj Shah and Steve Conine founded Wayfair in August 2002, as a two-person company with a makeshift headquarters in Conine’s nursery, in Boston, Massachusetts.[4] Both Shah and Conine hold Bachelor of Science degrees from Cornell University. The pair had run two previous companies—Simplify Mobile and iXL, a global consulting firm—before starting Wayfair.[5]
As of February 2013, Shah is the Chief Executive Officer of the company, and Conine is the Chairman and Chief Technology Officer.
Originally known as CSN Stores (the name is derived from a mix of Shah and Conine’s initials), the company began with the website racksandstands.com, selling media stands and storage furniture.
In 2003, the company added patio and garden goods suppliers, three online stores, and more than a dozen employees, and relocated the headquarters into an office on Newbury Street, in Boston.
Over the next two years, the company expanded its catalogue to include home décor; office, institutional, and kitchen and dining furniture and materials; home improvement goods; bed and bath materials; luggage; and lighting. In 2006, the company earned $100 million in sales.[6]
2007 to 2010[edit]
For the next four years, the company expanded in the United States and in international markets.
In 2008, CSN Stores began shipping to Canada and selling in the United Kingdom, and opened an office in London. In the same year, the Boston Business Journal ranked the company the #1 fastest growing private e-commerce company in Massachusetts, and the #4 fastest growing private company overall.[citation needed] In 2009, the company expanded to Germany. In 2010, the company relocated its headquarters to 177 Huntington Avenue, where they occupied 10 floors. At the end of that year, the company launched Joss & Main, a members-only private sales online store.
2011 to present[edit]
By 2011, CSN Stores owned over 200 online shops, largely niche shops for specific products, like cookware.com, everyatomicclock.com, and strollers.com. In an effort to scale, to direct traffic to a single site, and to unify the aesthetic of the company, Shah and Conine rebranded CSN Stores as Wayfair.
To market the new brand and to increase its expansion, in June 2011 the company raised $165 million in funding from four investment firms: Battery Ventures, Great Hill Partners, HarbourVest Partners, and Spark Capital.[7]
Wayfair.com launched on September 1, 2011.[8] As of July 2012, Wayfair had consolidated all of its niche websites, with the exception of Joss & Main and AllModern, into Wayfair.com. In August 2012, Wayfair launched Wayfair Supply, a single destination for Wayfair's business, government, and institutional customers. In August 2013, Wayfair acquired DwellStudio, a New York City-based design house and retailer focused on modern home and family furnishings.[9]
In March 2014, T. Rowe Price led a $157 million pre-IPO financing, valuing the company at more than $2 billion.[10]
In late June 2014, the company again relocated its headquarters, this time to 4 Copley Place, about a block away from its previous headquarters at 177 Huntington Avenue. Along with 4 Copley Place, the company has two satellite offices in the surrounding area.[11]
In October 2014, Wayfair raised over $300 million through an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange.[12] In July 2015, Wayfair sold its Australian business to local online retailer, Temple & Webster, for an undisclosed amount.[13] The brand was renamed to Zizo and later absorbed into the Temple & Webster business.
As of January 2014, Wayfair was the largest online-only retailer for home furniture in the United States,[14] and the 33rd largest online retailer in the United States.[15] The company generated $380 million in revenue in 2010, over $500 million in 2011, over $600 million in 2012, over $900 million in 2013, and over $1.3 billion in 2014.[16] In 2015, the net revenue of Wayfair increased to $2.25 billion,[17] and to $3.4 billion in 2016.[18]

Birthday


Happy 1st Birthday Son! 

Friday, December 11, 2015







11th
December 2014, Thursday. Me & my wife have never thought that
this is the day which is going to change our life, forever. The day
which turned out to be the most memorable day of our life. I remember
that morning when we visited the doctor and he happily surprised us
by saying that, “Today is the day!”. I was feeling more fear than
my wife, but I was acting opposite. 

I still remember pace of my
heart, jumping like a fish in water, when my wife was taken inside to
do the honors. However, the situation was more tensed outside, as if
India vs Pakistan cricket match reached to final over stage.
Suddenly, I heard a cute sound of crying inside. Yes, the match was
won, a baby boy was born!




Today,
the boy is turning 1. I always cherish the moment when I took him in
my arms for very first time and I felt “complete”. It has been
the most lively year of my life. Most of our conversations have been
non-verbal of course, but trust me; it’s the most beautiful ever. 

He makes me laugh when I’m sad. He makes me feel special when I
felt I’m not good enough. He probably understands me more than
anyone else. Every day, I eagerly wait for the moment when I reach
home and he runs towards me as soon as he sees me. And that half or a
minute of action is beyond words.




On
his 1st
birthday, I would also like to thank my wife for giving me such
precious gem. Thanks for bearing all the pain while you were
pregnant. Thanks for sharing sleepless nights. Thanks for running to
him when he cries. Thanks for being there with him whenever I can’t.




The
world is definitely a good place to live in. Education has taken
better approach. Freedom of speech has equal importance.
Opportunities are infinite. Laughter is far often heard. Love exists.
Relation matters. And, most importantly, humanity is still alive.




I
would not like to portray anything negative over here, because life
is full of positive things to focus into. I wish every human being
emphasizes more on ‘being human’ and so as my child. On his very
1st
birthday, I promise to support him in every course of life. I promise
to give him better education. I promise to provide him healthy &
competitive environment to grow. I promise to be a good father.




Happy
1st Birthday Son!

A Reservation Dream

Saturday, October 03, 2015









" There is no caste in blood." - Edwin Arnold

And, finally, a weekend arrived. It was a purposeful Saturday morning. The purpose was to spend quality time with family. The plan was set. A movie followed with a buffet lunch at city’s premium restaurant.

After waiting in queue at ticket window for long time, I’ve got my turn. To a bit of my surprise, the person at the window asked me, “What’s your caste, Sir?”. I didn’t get it at first. I thought listening to boss’s loud lectures and customer’s rude complaints everyday has brought me a hearing problem. So, I modestly said, “Sorry, I didn’t get you.” He repeated, “What’s your caste, Sir?” This time I heard it right. I thought that it might be a kind of survey by our government to see which caste views which actors’ movies the most, so that it would be easier for them to give election tickets to those actors in next election. I answered him. He politely said, “Sorry Sir, we only have one ticket reserved for your caste.” Till the time I realize what he said, I had been pushed out of the queue. Lately, I understood what he said but had no clue ‘why’.

Being a middle class family, we can’t afford to waste our time in thinking more about it, as we rarely get such time to spend with family. So, we decided to continue with our plan and reached the premium restaurant we always wanted to visit. And, to all of our surprise, the story repeated. There was a separate waiting list for different castes and we’ve been asked to wait for at least couple of hours to get a table which is suitable to our caste. I was upset. I found it totally disgusting. Till the time we understand the whole disturbing situation, I started hearing an alarm sound. And, to my great relief, it was morning alarm. What I saw was actually a dream. An unwanted dream.

“We’ve got a reservation”, a statement which is widely being used by Reserved category people to refer their scope (or rather rights) of getting admission in education institutes, however General category people use this to refer their either bus or train reservation. Reservation was introduced in the system at the time of era of untouchability, when the difference between earnings of rich & poor people was too big and poor people were not able to grow or even survive due to low education. The core intention was to provide equal rights to all, however nowadays it is being used (read misused here) by all those who actually are in no need of this special service.

The time has changed. In current trends, being in reserved category is such a privilege that everybody wants to be there. Wealthy and forward people have no issue in being known as ‘backwards’, rather they would be more than happy if government allows them to be so. Reservation word has started sounding like US Visa, everybody wants it, no matter how. The saddest thing is, this movement relatively affects the people who’re in actual need of this.

The constitution of country needs to be changed, not by adding more castes in OBCs, but by thinking about disposal of the whole reservation system. And, if it still needs to be there then it should purely be based on poverty line and should not be based on castes. Each caste is producing doctors and engineers nowadays. The castes which were backwards at the time of independence are very much wealthy nowadays. Moreover, there is also a large pool of poor people in General category, which neither gets an admission anywhere even though scoring high marks nor their families get any privileges. Nowadays, where government is busy in promoting ‘Skill India’, this diseased group of people is promoting ‘Reservation India’.

It’s the time to scrap the discrimination. It’s the time to decide whether ‘No Reservation’ or ‘Reservation for only Needy”. Otherwise, we’re not far away from the dream I saw above, when hospitals will also start taking admission based on castes. Petrol stations will also have a special queue for this low fuel people. Prices of vegetables will also be lower for them. All lower berths in train compartments will be allocated to them. Indian Cricket Team will also have 2 SCs, 3 STs, 6 OBCs and 1 General for 12th man. ATM machine will start giving 200 Rs when they request for 100 Rs, in which 50 Rs will be deducted from our account and government will contribute the rest 50 Rs. And, the most crucial one, girls will only marry those ‘privileged’ boys.

Let's stop PRESERVATION of RESERVATION !!!

Video Transcript00:07 Niraj Shah: 'Cause you have to do it with this faith that in the end it was all worth it. We had that faith, but we were scared about the journey.In 2002, Niraj Shah co-founded CSN Stores, which sold home furnishings online. At first, the company had more than 200 websites, each with a specific product niche.00:25 Shah: We started the company in 2002.00:27 Shah: And when we started the company in 2002, these categories, home goods, were not thought of as great internet ecommerce categories. Who was gonna buy their furniture on line, that type of thing. In order to make it easier for customers to find what they were looking for, we named the sites very clearly about what the category was. So, if you were looking for a bunk bed for your kids and you put the term bunk bed into Google or what have you, you find CSN Bunk Beds. You go to the site, and you were like, geez who knew there was a store that sold bunk beds. They have 450 of them. Wow! And so, that strategy worked well to take these categories that were not obvious internet commerce categories and make them very accessible. But we had one big problem, which is customers would tell us they had a fantastic experience and then 70% of them would tell us that they didn't know we had 200 other web sites. And we decided that was a big problem because if your loyal customers don't know about that, well, you're not gonna be able to get that repeat business.In 2010, CSN began to consider shutting down its niche sites--and redirecting customers to one main site.But the plan came with risks.01:34 Shah: The way we thought about this change, we were convinced that the new site would be, from a consumer's standpoint, what they really wanted. What we were nervous about, very nervous to be honest, is the transition from this model that was working great, to building up this new model. It's one of those things where you know you're gonna basically go off a cliff and you're gonna have to rebuild some of your momentum. Once you build it back up you're gonna be on a better trajectory then you've ever been on, but that journey is going to be a bad one in terms of the near term consequences. And we didn't know what that looked like. We didn't know what that curve looked like, because there's not very many companies who redirect sites at that traffic level, to a new site. So, it's generally viewed as a bad activity by Google.02:15 Shah: The math is if traffic goes down, volume goes down. If volume goes down, all of a sudden, as a company we employee 1,200 people and we have a certain fixed cost to operate. And as volume goes down, all of a sudden, we went from making money, we knew we'd go to not making money. That's scary. Right? And for us, we had not taken in outside capital. So, one of the things we did, we decided to bring in investors. And we said, well, let's bring in investors who believe in this strategy, but let's put some money on the balance sheet because we know we're gonna do something that's very risky but for this great outcome. And so, we did that and we did it because to be honest, we had no idea what the numbers would look like.On September 1, 2011, CSN Stores consolidated almost all its websites into one, Wayfair.com.The company's overall traffic fell after the change--but grew through 2011, surpassing what it had been.03:00 Shah: The thing about change is it introduces uncertainty. You're not sure what's gonna happen. You're not sure that you're introducing risk, and these are not things people generally want to do. But, I think if you don't change, you run the risk of things actually changing against you.To date, Wayfair has raised $201 million from Batter Ventures, Great Hill Partners, Spark Capital and HarbourVest Partners.In 2012, its revenue was more than $600 million.
