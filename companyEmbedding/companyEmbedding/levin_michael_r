Desperate while seeking for help I made errors due to lack of information and no experiences.  When I called the lawyers office to set up an appointment I had the blessing of talking to Tanya first.  It was amazing that there was no judgment towards me, showing excellent listening skills even with my accent.  She was very professional, caring, and at the same time, polite.  She made me feel like if she knew me forever.  When I met with her and Jeff the lawyer all I was doing is trying to get some information and see if there was a way to correct the errors I made due ignorance and to learn what kind of consequences I was about to face.  They took my case.  They have taken care of me step by step in an amazing and wonderful way.    A lot of professionals are hungry for money and want money, but there are only a few who truly care for their client.  To tell you the truth, it is not truly about me but the well being of my children in the process of everything I’ve been facing. Jeff, Tanya and the staff have been honest, professional, and caring.  They don’t say it but they show it. This is great!!! I recommend for you to give yourself an opportunity to meet them and trust that they will do what is the right and best for you and your family.   No, I am not being paid by anyone to say these words which are even better. A lot of businesses pay to get great feedback, but they don’t.Saying thank you is not enough, but showing appreciation in every way possible is what I am trying to do by sharing my experience with you.  Not only that, but I am telling you that you will be in great hands if you allow them to help you through this process.Law Offices of Dan NewlinCarolee K. ratedMr Anderson helped me with my caseI had the opportunity to be a client of George "Dutch" Anderson , of the Dan Newlin Law Office. I was in a auto accident, and he personally kept me updated on every aspect of my case. He never let me feel alone in the process. He even kept my file in his office so he could update it when needed.When my husband first contacted him, he was confident that Mr. Anderson, would give my case all the time it took to follow me and my medical issues. After the accident I returned to my home state of New York. Even though my accident happen in Orlando while I was there on business, Mr. Anderson made arrangements for me to been seen by doctors in my local area, on Long Island. I was hospitalized a few times in NY and under specialized care . Mr Anderson followed up with my Doctors in NY, to make sure all my medical needs were cared for.We moved to Florida, shortly after the accident, Mr..Anderson provided me with Doctors to look after my medical care. He made sure that my Social Security Disability was filed and accepted.When I had a question, Mr. Anderson, he would have the answers I needed. I never had the need of an Attorney before, and being disabled because of a car accident, made it a scary experience. He treated me in a kind and professional manner.My son was also in the accident, and he was represented by Mr. Anderson as well. Since my son was a resident of Florida, Mr. Anderson made sure all my son's medical needs were cared for. The accident was not my son's fault as we were hit by an Airport Rent a Car van, that come over to our lane.Just the thought, that my life changed in one second, showed me the need to rely on an Attorney. Mr. Anderson was the right choice for me and my son.Carolee KaufoldLaw Offices of Dan NewlinShaina M. ratedMy review for them:Amazing experience from start to finish. I was mostly in contact with Ashlye's paralegal Courtney and Courtney was so sweet! She was very friendly and professional. She took the time to get to know me a little bit. I loved the fact that when she would call me we would talk about my case but she would also throw in things like "How's your new baby girl?", or "How are you doing?" She wasn't intrusive at all in the least bit. I really enjoyed knowing that not only was my case important to them;  I was also important to the firm. I was always updated. Never left in the dark about things, which I really appreciated. Now what really amazed me after an agreement was reached, was how much work was put in to make sure I got the most money. They searched for discounts and other things to bring my portion up a lot higher than it would have been. They went above and beyond on that because reglardess they were getting their portion. They could have left it as it was but they didn't. They kept fighting for me even after the agreement was reached. I really hope I never have another injury again, but God forbid if I do, Dan Newlin will always be my go to! 100% recommend!!Michael T Gibson PA Auto Justice AttorneyLv 1. ratedI was hurt on the job through no fault of my own.  I was hit by a car while standing by my vehicle.  An elderly woman backed right into me.  She didn’t even bother to look.  Shortly after the accident, I received a call from her insurance company.  Then they showed up at my house, even taking pictures.  I was scared and immediately reached out to a lawyer.  I researched auto accident firms online and was very impressed with what I read about the Law Firm of Michael T. Gibson.  The personal experiences he endured with his grandmother and mother’s car accident really drew me to his firm.  He could relate to what I was going through and brought a real passion to the process. The accident robbed me of the ability to drive a truck- which was my livelihood.  I sustained a broken leg, serious damage to my hip and ACL. These injuries have confined me to a wheelchair and a walker. I still have several surgeries to go, but throughout the entire process the law firm has been there for me every step of the way.  Always giving me timely updates on my case, and fighting for me against all odds.  They always went the extra mile for me- particularly Luz, Jen and Syd! Law Offices of Dan NewlinDrew H. ratedI was rear-ended on 1-4, went to the emergency room, and laid around the house in pain for days until my dad said to hire an attorney. I contacted the Law Offices of Dan Newlin by e-mail on their website, and almost immediately I received a phone call from Attorney Ryan Rhyce. Then things changed for me. First, the law firm knows the best places to go for treatment. Second, I could focus on getting better while Attorney Rhyce negotiated with the insurance company. Trust me, negotiating with insurance companies is extremely difficult. For those of you who have been in a car accident and are looking on the Internet trying to decide whether to hire an attorney, call Attorney Ryan Rhyce. He is honest, and you can trust him. He watches his e-mail all the time, and it’s sometimes scary how fast he responds (for quite a while I have suspected there are two of him). You will be in good hands. Don’t try to evaluate whether or not you need an attorney. Attorney Rhyce will give you an honest opinion. Please call him. There is no need to suffer in pain on the sofa.Michael T Gibson PAAshash790 K. ratedI was involved in two car accidents back-to-back.  I had heard very positive things about the Law Firm of Michael T. Gibson and decided to give their office a call.  Prior to the first accident, I had never been in a car accident before.  Dealing with the insurance company, selecting the right doctors to go to for my injuries was all foreign to me.  I worked closely with Jennifer throughout the process and she could not have been more sweet and caring when it came to my situation.  It’s hard to believe they had other clients with the amount of care and attention they gave to me!   Any question I had was answered promptly.   Their entire office is extremely helpful, everything is done in a timely manner.  With my second accident, there was no doubt as to who I would call.  That accident was more severe and Jennifer did an amazing job getting me the settlement I deserved.  I always refer them to anyone involved in a car accident and will continue to do so. A.W. NeJame Law FirmLeandro L. ratedWe used Nayef Mubarak of NeJame Law Firm in Orlando for my green card case. I am a citizen of Venezuela and entered to United States in 2012 on a J1 Visa subject to the 2 year home residency requirement. After obtaining my second J1 Visa I married my husband and we contacted Nayef to help us. Gay marriage is fairly new in the US and we found Nayef to be very caring, accepting, experienced, and knowledgeable, therefore this is why we chose him as our lawyer. Attorney Mubarak helped us obtain an I-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) a waiver for the 2 year rule home residency requirement and finally a Green Card.  Before our AOS interview and our last day with Nayef he did a good job comforting and ensuring us on such an important day. He was successful in preparing all the above applications and all of them were approved without any issues. We highly recommend Nayef Mubarak, especially to gay couples in a binational relationship with the same case as oursLaw Offices of Dan NewlinNick R. ratedMr Dan Newlin and his staff Melissa Lewis were excellent people to handle my case and they were very very very professional caring and went the extra mile to make sure that I was taking care of medically and was checking on me and make sure that I was okay if I ever got in another accident I don't have to look for anyone all I can have to do is call the best attorneys handling medical issues for accidents Dan Newlin and his partners excellent excellent job and I want to thank Melissa Lewis and the private investigators and the medical staff that helped me along the way thank you very much and I approve this message. It was very unfortunate that my mother recently was involved in an accident and I did not hesitate to have her call Dan Newlin and his Partners to handle her case and her issues with her accident and they have show her the up most respect and giving her confidence and they will assist her throughout her process as well thank youMichael T Gibson PA Auto Justice AttorneyChristina T. ratedI got into a car accident and immediately turned to the law firm of Michael T. Gibson.   At the time, I was working in a doctor’s office, where some of Michael’s clients came in to get treatment, and this is where I first saw the dedication and compassion Michael has for his clients.   I was involved in a multi-car accident and rear-ended by a pick-up truck driving home on a rainy day.  I needed extra medical care from specialists and a surgeon for the injuries I sustained.  My case manager, Syd was wonderful.  She took me through everything, answered all of my questions.  I never had any concerns because they handled everything with the insurance company and kept me positive throughout the process.  All I had to do was focus on taking care of me and getting better. Michael and Melissa were terrific.  I have referred the firm to everyone I know, because you are truly in the best hands.  Alena Baker Criminal Defense PAElliott E. ratedI had the opportunity to meet Attorney Baker when I hired an attorney to take my case.  Although she was not my primary attorney, I was amazed at how strong she is in the courtroom.  Attorney Baker is sharp, knowledgeable and concerned about the client.  This woman would be great to represent you because she is not timid, passive or a pushover.  She was aggressive and not at all afraid to go after the opposition.  Coupled with my primary attorney, they made an excellent tag team.  Watching them work together was very comforting. I knew I was in good hands and had picked a very competent pair to represent me.The verdict was in my favor and I owe half of the success of it to Attorney Baker.  Thank you very much Ms. Baker for your strong character and your drive to represent your clients in a professional manner that just happens to come out victorious!Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

Amazon Echo Breaks Out in Fourth Quarter






By Michael R. Levin





































Estimate Over 8 Million Echo Homes in US, Alexa Has Multiple Uses
Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) released analysis of Amazon Echo from Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).
This analysis indicates that 8.2 million US Amazon customers have an Amazon Echo devices, purchased since its late-2014 introduction. Awareness of Amazon Echo among US Amazon customers increased dramatically in the past twelve months, and Echo owners use it as a voice-responsive Internet query device and household controller, in addition to a high-end streaming music speaker.
CIRP estimates that among US Amazon customers, awareness of Amazon Echo increased to 82% as of December 31, 2016. It increased from 47% as of the same time one year ago (at December 31, 2015) and from 20% as of March 31, 2015, the first full quarter following its introduction (Chart 1).

Chart 1: Amazon customer awareness of Amazon Echo
Amazon efforts to promote the expanded Echo product line appears to have paid off. With traditional media advertising and prominent placement at the Amazon.com website, Echo product awareness among Amazon customers continued its rapid ascent in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Based on our research, CIRP estimates that approximately 8.2 million US Amazon customers own an Amazon Echo device, including the original Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Tap. Based on the Echo ownership estimate, we also estimate Amazon sold approximately 3.1 million Echo devices in the US in the October-December 2016 period.
The installed base of homes with Amazon Echo devices has grown dramatically, and close to tripled in the past twelve months. Amazon promoted Echo aggressively over the holiday shopping season, with especially aggressive pricing for the Echo Dot.  The new models account for close to half of sales since Amazon introduced them earlier in 2016.
Customers use Amazon Echo for many purposes, including playing music, answering questions, and controlling home systems, such as television, lighting, and HVAC. Two-thirds of Amazon customers report using it as an information provider responding to questions, and over 40% as a speaker for listening to streaming audio (Chart 2).

Chart 2: How consumers use Amazon Echo (multiple responses allowed, percentages sum to over 100%)
More Echo owners use it as an information source than as a voice-controlled music device. Amazon positioned Echo and the Alexa software as much more than a smart audio player. Amazon clearly wants it to become an Internet browser and even a home controller. Hundreds of third-party electronics, appliance, and even auto manufacturers now offer products that work with Alexa. Amazon wants Alexa to be the starting point for the move to connected-automated homes.
CIRP bases its findings on surveys of 500 US subjects who made a purchase at Amazon.com in the period from October-December 2016. For additional information, please contact CIRP.

Michael Levin on Academic Medicine and Hospitals in Their Campaign to Protect the Medical IndustryIntegrator adviser and columnist Michael Levin read the brief in the August 2014 Integrator Round-up entitled "Hospital group begins
campaign promoting its role disease as an economic engine." The
subject is an organization of U.S. hospitals and academic health 
centers, the Coalition to Protect America's Health Care (CPAH).
The organization was created to protect economic life as hospitals know
it. Their strategy leads with calling attention to the jobs they create
and their economic impact on communities. I questioned whether this 
strategy is ethical of nominally "healthcare" organizations. Levin, the 
founder of the Health Business Strategies consultancy,
dives into CPAH and share details: over $14-million of marketing and 
lobbying revenues from 2011-2013. He particularly notes the role of 
academic health centers in this self-protective work.

Columnist Michael Levin: Finding Opportunity for Integrative Medicine Amidst Healthcare Chaos - The Concierge ModelHealthcare business strategist and Integrator columnist Michael Levin was one of the earliest players in the integrative health field who sought to focus attention on the importance of establishing the business case for integration and inclusion. With a background as an
executive in both Pharma and natural products companies, Levin's early 
focus was on pharmacy substitution strategies. Business models were 
needed to require payers to explore. Here Levin speaks to another sort of business model, this time extolling a direction that is outside the box of the payment system.

Integrator Forum: 7 Voices on Whether the Bravewell's "Integrative Medicine in America" Portrays What the Title Advertises


No one doubts whether the 
Bravewell Collaborative's new mapping study added useful understanding 
of the nation's health system-sponsored and academic health 
center-sponsored integrative clinics. But do these thumbnails, reports 
and tables on these 29 clinics capture what the title suggests: Integrative Medicine in  America: How Integrative Medicine is Being Practiced in the United States? I posed the question. Here are responses from: public health acupuncturist and researcher Beth Sommers, MPH, LAc, PhD; holistic
medical doctor Bill Manahan, MD; Integrator columnist Michael Levin; 
rehab specialist and past American Association of Medical Acupuncturists
board member Mitchell Prywess, MD; an anonymous integrative MD; 
National University of Health Sciences president Jim Winterstein, DC; 
and senior editor of the Textbook of Functional Medicine Sheila Quinn. I conclude with my own speculations on what might be different in community-based integrative medicine.

Michael
Levin and Stephen Bolles: FICO's Data Grabbing, Medical Improvement and
Consumer Choice of Alternative Medicine 






The
stories of patients arriving at doors of 
integrative practitioner offices with avoidance of prescriptions as 
their 
motivation are legion. In an earlier column, Stephen Bolles, DC 
challenged the move of credit rating firm FICO into drug adherence 
monitoring in part for its failure to appreciate what may be called 
positive non-adherence. In this exchange, Integrator columnist 
Michael Levin notes the substantial estimates of harm from 
non-adherence. His take is friendlier toward FICO's intent. Bolles 
responds, and Levin replies. It's a complicated exchange in which 
paradigms collide. I add a couple comments.

Columnist Michael Levin: Compilation of 4 Years of Integrator Commentaries & Perspectives   Making the cost case. A decade ago, now Integrator
adviser and columnist Michael Levin and I connected on this theme. 
Levin's passion for the topic was, and remains, informed by experience 
of conventional medical stakeholder perspectives, in part due to his own
background as executive with pharma, medical devices and more recently,
with supplement companies. Presently a consultant to the field, Levin 
published his first Integrator column in January 2007 and has 
fashioned 20 columns and short commentaries since. His contributions are
frequently stimulated by news items that underscore the importance of 
the economic argument for integrative and wellness practices. A second 
regular theme relates to issues surrounding natural products. Levin's 
value to the Integrator is less visible but also considerable in 
the numerous news items and studies he has sent my way through the 
years. It is a pleasure to make his contributions visible.

Reader Forum: Levin, Forbes, Rohleder, Calabrese, Stumpf, Holmes and Taylor on Integrator Themes


A
nice mix of themes and responses here: Michael Levin on the 
Seely-Herman research on cost savings of whole practice ND care for 
Canada Post employees; AHMA president David Forbes, MD on the NCCAM 
priorities; short notes on the 
Georgetown-Bastyr relationship promoted by Adi Haramati, PhD; Barney 
Holmes on biases relative to alternative medicine in Wikipedia; Carlo
Calabrese, ND, MPH on what "CAM" fields have in common according to 
Wikipedia; Community Acupuncture Network co-founder Lisa Rohleder, LAc, 
AOM educator Steven Stumpf, EdD and AOM student Leah Taylor on the 
incomes of licensed acupuncturists as reported by the National 
Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, plus a 
brief note from an anonymous naturopathic physician who believes that 
her profession has a similarly challenged economic perch. I comment on 
the link between Levin/Forbes and the income discussion.

Levin Comments: Australian report finds cost benefits from acupuncture and natural product interventions
The National Institute of Complementary Medicine
(NICM), established with seed funding provided by the Australian 
Government and a New South Wales governmental agency has published a recent report
that found cost effectiveness for most of the handful of therapies 
examined. The agency sent a September 13, 2010 press release entitled Economic report finds complementary medicine could ease health budget. Integrator columnist and adviser Levin, in his commentary, notes that "If the presenteeism and absenteeism costs of low-back pain are averted, the benefits from acupuncture would double."

Michael Levin: Opportunities for Integrative Medicine in MedCo Study of Pharma in Treatment of Children  
A
disturbing new report from Medco documents the growing use of major 
pharmaceuticals in the treatment of children. Use with childhood chronic
diseases is highlighted with a particular area of concern the drug 
treatment of Type 2 diabetes associated with childhood obesity. Integrator
columnist Michael Levin, a healthcare consultant with Health Business 
Strategies, seizes on the report's recommendation that "health plans 
actively promote lifestyle change." Levin urges the right integrative 
medicine entrepreneurs to step up to a potentially lucrative business 
opportunity.

Integrator Columnist Michael Levin
on the McCain-Dorgan Dietary Supplement Safety Act of 2010; McCain 
Backing Down 




The "McCain Bill,"as it quickly became known, has stirred 
up a furor in the integrative practice and natural products communities.
Practitioner, consumer and industry interests are peppering their lists
with alerts about a proposed bill which they argue will increase 
regulatory burden, limit access to supplements and significantly 
increase costs. US Senator John McCain used the Senator floor to take on
the arguments of his opponents. Major league sports are backing McCain.
The proposal is called the Dietary Supplement Safety Act of 2010. Here 
are links to key viewpoints followed by a critical analysis from Integrator
columnist Michael Levin whose professional career spans executive 
positions in big Pharma and the supplements industry. He offers a useful
regulatory strategy by focusing on the narrows of the production river.
(Note: At publication time word arrived that McCain was backing down.) More

Bipartisan Push Heats Debate 
on Financial Incentives for Wellness: Good for Integrative Practice?


Passage of a bipartisan amendment from US 
Senators John Ensign (R-NV) and Tom Carper (D-DE) has elevated a debate Integrator
columnist Michael Levin has repeated brought to these pages. To change 
behavior, in Levin's view, "education rarely works, economics usually 
does." The Ensign-Carper amendment allow health plan costs to be cut by 
as much as 50% for those who engage healthy behaviors. Some unions and 
major disease-based organizations are opposed. Employers tend to support
the direction, as Kenneth R. Pelletier, PhD, MD(hc) and Sean Sullivan, 
JD, each share. A tremendous discussion has been kindled on the Washington
Post site. Levin lays out what he believes are significant 
opportunities for the integrative medicine community. Where are you on 
this issue of patient engagement, habit change, healthcare economics and
public policy?

Columnist Michael Levin: 
Author Michael Pollan's View of Insurance Reform Supports Investment in 
Integrative Practices
In a recent column in the New York Times,
author Michael Pollan pits big 
food vs. big insurance, arguing 
that the elephant in the room in healthcare reform is obesity, and that 
the solution comes to slimming down. Integrator columnist 
Michael Levin finds in Pollan's perspective evidence that key 
characteristics of current insurance reform efforts create financial 
incentives that support investment in integrative practices. One 
wonders, with Pollan, whether "Washington can summon the political will 
to take on
and reform a second, even more powerful industry: the food industry." 
Yet Levin's argument is clear that we may be seeing changes that could stimulate investment
in therapeutic approaches which support habit change. Will these changes incentivize insurers to 
finally invest
significantly in health creation?

Columnist Michael Levin: Pepsico May be Our Guru on How to Reduce Behavior-based Healthcare Costs

Did you know
that Pepsico is threatening to move all its operations out of New York
if the state passes a "sin-tax" on soda pop? Integrator columnist
Michael Levin recognized in this story that the giant firm has a rather
strong perspective on whether economic incentives can be a powerful
stimulus for behavior change. Levin uses the story to wade into
questions raised in a recent British Medical Journal article on
what it will take for people to make healthy decisions. Fascinating
piece. Levin invites you to weigh in on the topic. More

Columnist Michael Levin: California’s Attorney General Takes Action Against Supplement Companies


Integrator
adviser and columnist Michael Levin reports on a recent California
action, under Proposition 65, against 56 dietary supplement companies.
The issue is a level of lead in their products which required informing
their customers. Levin uses the column to remind clinicians and
administrators of the importance of vigilance of supplement
manufacturers about the extent of their quality control plans. The
story was brought to Levin's attention through Michael McGuffin and the
American Herbal Products Association. More ...

Michael Levin: On Globalization, Melamine Contamination and Responsibilities of Integrative Practitioners
Integrator
adviser and columnist Michael Levin often speaks to us from the
discomforting chasm between the aspirations of integrative medicine and
current realities regarding the natural healthcare products which most
integrative practitioners prescribe in their offices. Here, Levin
focuses on "economic adulteration" of dietary supplements in the recent
story of melamine contamination of infant formulas which caused
sickness and death in China. What are the integrative practitioner's
responsibilities in raising the bar? More ...

Michael Levin: Statins for 8-year-olds and Mayo Clinic's Whole Practice, Integrative Treatment

The big medical
news just after Independence Day was that, following new American
Academy of Pediatrics recommendations, thousands of children will soon
be dependent on statins for cholesterol management. Integrator
columnist Michael Levin muses on this news together with a virtually
unnoticed whole system, integrative Mayo Clinic study which found that
lifestyle, supplements, diet and yoga or Tai chi not only lowered
cholesterol but also weight and who knows what other positive outcomes.
Are statins parenting replacement therapies? More ...

Columnist Levin:  $24-Billion Savings through Supplement Interventions Says Lewin GroupIntegrator columnist
Michael Levin recently had occasion to read a series of reports,
prepared by the internationally-known health care consulting firm, The
Lewin Group. The subject: possible cost impact of pro-actively using a
few dietary supplement interventions for a handful of conditions. The
outcomes were compelling. Levin argues that this kind of work, funded
by the dietary supplement industry, exemplifies forward thinking
collaborative effort needed to advance the integrative and natural
health fields. The story of this strategic funding will be familiar to
chiropractic. More ...

Columnist Michael Levin: Deloitte Survey of Health Consumers Offers Insights for Integrative Medicine


Integrator columnist Michael Levin
shares intriguing outcomes of a healthcare survey from the Deloitte
Center for Health Solutions. The authors examine opinions and practices
of over 3000 consumers, identifying use of alternative healthcare
services as a key identifier of behavior across a series of consumer
types. The six types range from "content and compliant" to "out and
about" (the most significant alt-med users) to "shop and save." Current
complementary medicine use represents a fraction of the openness
expressed by these consumers. Paul Keckley, PhD, co-author
and director of the Center was formerly the head of integrative
medicine planning for Vanderbilt University. Levin is correct: there is
much here to ponder about integrative care and the changing nature of
the healthcare consumer. More ...

Columnist Michael Levin: Opportunities for Integrative Medicine in a Recent AARP Report on Drug Price EscalationIntegrator columnist
Michael Levin, founder of Health Business Strategies, is a long-time
promoter of integrative medicine strategies that challenge the often
costly, unsafe and quality of life-damaging interventions promoted by
Big Pharma. So when Levin, who has been an executive with both pharmaceutical
and dietary supplement firms, saw the new AARP report on drug price
trends pre and post the implementation of the Medicare Drug Benefit, he
analyzed it both for what Pharma had already extracted, and for what
integrative medicine might. Here is Levin's brief report and view of
opportunities. More ...

Levin Investigates the Status of Natural Products Quality Initiatives
Most
integrative practitioners and consumers have some awareness that
various forms of certification of product quality are increasingly available to natural
products firms. Integrator
adviser Michael Levin looks into the dependability of such
certification. He begins with a comment from Alan Greenspan on trust,
then goes down the rabbit hole into issues surrounding United States
Pharmacopoeia, Concumerlab.com and the major supplement manufacturer
Leiner. It's a fascinating and sobering journey. More ...

Integrator Columnist: Michael Levin on 
CAM Practitioners & Natural Products Companies

There is no question that the holistic, naturopathic, Oriental, chiropractic and integrative medicine professions are in bed with pharmaceutical companies ... natural
pharma, that is. The question is, how is this relationship best
effected? Put differently, can these professions avoid the pitfalls of
the MD-Big Pharma marriage and take advantage of each other's
strengths? In this third column in an ongoing series on the topic begun
by David Matteson, Integrator adviser Michael Levin - who has
held executive positions for both Big Pharma and natural products firms
- weighs in on the issue. More ...

Integrator Adviser Levin on Dietary Supplements and the FDA's cGMPs: What  Defines "Quality?" - a 2nd Look


Integrator adviser Michael Levin continues with his analysis and commentary on the current
Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) finally published by the US Food
and Drug Administration. In this take, looks at how the industry and
the FDA have defined "quality" and finds out they are not aligned. What
does this mean for practitioners and consumers? Levin brings it all
home for ginger lovers with his analysis of a July 2007 action on
imported ginger by a California regulatory agency. He credits AHPA, the
herb industry organization, for its demand that the FDA set the bar higher, and offers a forecast. More ...

Your Comments:
3 on
the Chrysler group services; COCSA/AMI partnership; case for an
integrated asthma pathway and more on Hurley's campaign against
supplements


The
story on the success of a group-focused services clinical strategy for
a Chrysler employee population led by Robert Levine, PhD, for Henry
Ford Health Systems (HFHS),
prompted Lisa Rohleder, LAc, with the Community Acupuncture Network
(CAN) to stimulate a dialogue and real-time link with Levine in the CAN
Blog. The HFHS outcomes promoted Adrian Langford, who runs a
patient-focused program with a Medicaid population with Alternative
Medicine Integration Group to comment on what promotes the positive
patient outcomes. Taylor Walsh wonders at the use by Karlo Berger, ABT,
LMT, of "collective healing" to describe some of the power of these
setting ... In other notes, the COCSA-AMI relationship stimulated a
note from COCSA executive director Janet Jordan ... Chris Huson, LAc
opens a dialogue about a suggested integrated pathway for asthma and
Rik Cederstrom , DC, responds to another attack on supplements by
author Michael Hurley, this one broadcast for Medscape plus comments from Michael Levin. More ...

Integrator Adviser Speaks: Levin on the Impact of the FDA's GMPs on the Dietary Supplement IndustryThe natural
products industry in the United States has a boatload of stories of
businesses started in homes and garages that grew to become dominant
players. The Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) for dietary
supplements document recently issued by the FDA promises to significant
change the terrain. What effect will it have on the industry? Integrator adviser
Michael Levin addresses this topic in Part 2 of his analysis of the
cGMPs. Levin also addresses questions regarding his first article which
were raised by Michael McGuffin, executive director of the American
Herbal Products Association. More ...

Integrator Adviser Speaks: Levin on the FDA's New Dietary Supplement GMPs - Worth the Wait?

After a
12 years of unsteady and politicized process, the US Food and Drug
Administration last month finally issued its new Good Manufacturing
Practices (GMPs) for dietary supplements. Integrator advisor Michael Levin is making his way through the 831 pages of the GMP document. In this Part #1 filing for the Integrator,
Levin reveals a strange conceptual approach to GMPs which will allow
companies to make claims that sound equivalent (ie, "we follow GMPs")
which actually give the consumer no information about the quality of
the products. For those wishing to know more about the likely impact of
the GMP on consumers and manufacturers, a September 13-14 conference
led by Loren Israelsen and
the United Natural Products Alliance will explore the full meaning of
the new GMP. More ...

Integrator Adviser Speaks: Levin on Whether Supplement Quality May be Influencing Clinical Outcomes 
Another recent Integrator post
reports outcomes of a survey of media coverage of dietary supplements
in 2006. The outcomes were not pretty for the industry. Integrator
editorial adviser Michael Levin noted two recent reports, both on chondroitin, which might
explain some of that negativity. Levin, who has held executive level
positions for both Big Pharma and supplement companies, focuses on a
Consumerlab.com quality and potency study and an efficacy study in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Is there a useful pattern emerging? More ...

Disquieting Journalistic Ethics: Michael Levin Challenges New York Times and Dietary Supplement Basher Dan Hurley

On January 16, the New York Times
published an essay by supplement-bashing author Dan Hurley entitled
"Dietary Supplements and Safety: Some Disquieting Data." Michael Levin,
an Integrator advisor who has held executive level positions in
both pharmaceutical and dietary supplement companies, immediately
researched Hurley's core assertions and discredited them. Here is the
full letter to the editor which Levin has shipped off to the New York Times.
Are clear thinking and accuracy of interest to this staid daily? Truth
is presently again a casualty in Hurley's war against supplements.
