      hump racks as well as Powhata pin racks. Thomas Products fire hose cabinets are manufactured with 
      high quality materials and designed to protect fire hose and associated fire hose hardware such 
      as nozzles, valves, and spray heads from exposure to harsh UV rays, chemicals, moisture, dust, salt 
      air, insects, and temperature extremes. Thomas Products fiberglass cabinets are manufactured under 
      U.S. Patent No. 4,998,587 and are available in a variety of UV inhibited colors as well as interiors
