Product Description▼▲
Incisive essays from a master wordsmithWhy has Don Juan become so passé of late? What's the trouble with Ayn Rand? How did the Doge of Venice come to venerate the counterfeit remains of Siddhartha Gautama? Why does the Bentley family's collection of ancestral relics include a bronzed human thumb? And what, exactly, is the story behind Great Uncle Aloysius, who was born a Quaker but died a pagan? This collection of occasional essays brings us David Bentley Hart at his finest: startlingly clear and deliciously abstruse, coolly wise and burningly witty, fresh and timeless, mystical and concrete - often all at once. Hart's incisive blend of philosophy, moral theology, and cultural criticism, together with his flair for both the well-told story and the well-turned phrase, is sure to delight.

            For the reader who writes (or for the writer who reads), certain authors are a gold mine.  With a bracing vocabulary, a precision of thought, and a way with a sentence that manages to be both wise and witty, David Bentley Hart has a perspective on the world that requires a careful reading   that is well-rewarded.


In A Splendid Wickedness, a collection of fifty-two occasional essays, I recorded a list of twenty-four completely unfamiliar words, not including all those that I recognized but have only admired from afar.  Although I prefer a traditional book to my Kindle for most reading, e-readers might have been invented for this caliber of writing because of their ready access to a dictionary.   Since I had to look up my new words the old-fashioned way, I will treat you to my five favorites:


autochthonous  indigenous; formed in the place where it is found


bedizen  to dress or adorn gaudily


sidereal  of our relating to stars or constellations


orgulous  proud


eidetic  marked by extraordinarily accurate and vivid recall


(Youre welcome.)


The journey through A Splendid Wickedness covers terrain as diverse as the virtues of idleness, capital punishment, baseball, book reviews, and a series of philosophical ponderings delivered in a warm and furry tone by Harts dog, Roland.


The title track (Essay #23) examines literary characters Don Juan and Don Quixote, and wonders aloud why the figure of Quixote has been borne aloft by his beautiful and mysterious timelessness, while Juan has become pass.  Swerving from literary to cultural criticism, Hart concludes that because we have, in our time, lost our appreciation for a transcendent good, and because our culture is not subject to the torments of immutable moral laws, there can be no such thing as splendid wickedness, simply because, if we do not see ourselves in the light of the Good beyond being, nothing in our nature can be cast in sufficiently striking relief.


It is this sort of cogent thinking that shows up in Bents thoughts on various topics:


The wonderful thing about holiness, when you really encounter it, is that it testifies to itself.


All that is needed to make even the most outlandish theory seem plausible to the truly doctrinaire materialist is that it come wrapped in the appurtenances of empirical science.


 . . . the worst fate that could befall America, one far grimmer than the mere loss of some of its fiscal or political supremacy in the world, would be the final triumph of a true cultural secularism.


Having read straight through all fifty-two essays, my impulse now is to put the book on my nightstand (with Amy Carmichael, Luci Shaw, Madeleine LEngle, and Elisabeth Elliot) for a slower read  a take-one-weekly-for-a-year-prescription for an infusion of fine writing and sharp thinking.


In my favorite essays, the author shinnies out onto some of the shakier limbs of his family tree, finding there a practicing pagan (complete with sacrifices to Janus on a marble altar); a bronzed, severed left thumb (a relic from a chance amputation in a formal duel); and a metaphysical materialist who was obsessed with death.  As for me, my ancestral roots run all gnarly into Northern Maine and the Canadian Maritimes, a people who expressed themselves in ways both understated and forceful.  After an aspirated pause, Im sure they would have pronounced Harts book to be wicked splendid.


And they would have been correct.
