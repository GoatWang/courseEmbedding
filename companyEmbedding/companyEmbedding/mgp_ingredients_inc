Distillery Co-Products



In addition to beverage spirits and food grade industrial alcohol, MGP produces corn oil, distillers feeds and a certain amount of fuel grade alcohol. Each of these co-products serves distinct customer needs across a diverse range of markets. Additionally, from a grain optimization standpoint, the value of these co-products is clear: the more total use of a resource, the greater the impact on production efficiencies, not to mention conservation efforts. An extraordinary 98.5% of all the raw materials MGP uses is returned in forms that have viable commercial applications.
Corn Oil
Contained in corn germ, corn oil is recovered from syrup produced during the alcohol production process before being added to dryers used in the manufacture of distillers feeds. This is accomplished at MGP using an innovative, state-of-the-art corn oil extraction system. The corn oil we produce is principally used by manufacturers of biodiesel, and also as a rich supplement, or fattening agent, for poultry feed applications.
Distillers Feed
The quality of MGP’s distillers feeds suits the need for well-developed, well-balanced rations to supply the vitamins and minerals necessary for profitable weight-grains in livestock. In addition to their high nourishment value, these feeds are extraordinarily versatile. MGP manufactures a unique blend of distillers dried grains with soluble (DDGS). Containing 25% protein, 7% fat, 8% fiber and 10% moisture, this unusual mixture provides nutritional benefits that are not available in other distillers feeds. We also produce Condensed Distillers Solubles (CDS). This product contains 5% protein, 2.5% fat and 60% moisture. Used in the cattle feeding industry as a direct additive to dry-feed rations CDS has been shown to produce more pounds of meat per pound of feed consumed than rations not containing this product.
Fuel Grade Alcohol
There are many applications for alcohol, but none quite as unique as its use in motor fuel. At MGP, we produce fuel grade alcohol as a clean-burning additive for reformulated gasoline. The EPA many years back undertook a program to eliminate the lead content in gasoline. Accordingly, refiners needed a good, environmentally clean octane additive. Fuel grade alcohol certainly fulfilled this need. Today, the fuel ethanol industry has grown and matured to include a Renewable Fuels Standard that mandates the use of clean-burning ethanol in the gasoline industry.

MGP Ingredients, Inc. Announces Sale of KC Facility, Pet Business to Sergeant's Pet Care Products
ATCHISON, Kan., August 24, 2009—MGP Ingredients, Inc. (Nasdaq/MGPI) has announced the sale of its Kansas City, Kan., facility to Sergeant’s Pet Care Products, Inc.  The sale was completed this past Friday, Aug. 21, for an initial payment of $3.6 million, with provision for additional earn out payments to be paid over time. The sale includes all equipment used for the production and packaging of pet-related products, which principally include extruded plant-based resins and finished pet treats. MGPI will retain ownership of equipment that is used for the production of the company’s Wheatex® textured wheat proteins, which are sold for use in meat extension and vegetarian product applications.  This equipment is located in a separate section of the facility and will be operated under a toll manufacturing arrangement between Sergeant’s and MGPI.
“The divestiture of this facility along with assets related to the manufacture of pet products is a key step in our business transformation process,” said Tim Newkirk, MGPI president and chief executive officer. “It supports our strategy to place increased focus on those core areas of our business where we possess the greatest amount of expertise and can deliver the greatest amount of value to the categories we serve.”  
Newkirk added: “We are very pleased with the acquisition of the Kansas City facility by Sergeant’s Pet Care Products, an innovator in the pet industry. We look forward to maintaining our relationship through their involvement in the production of our unique line of Wheatex® ingredients.”
“Our purchase of the Kansas City facility from MGPI allows us to expand production of our formulated pet treats, some of which include Sergeant’s SteakHouse®, Sniffers® and DentaFresh®,” said Bob Scharf, chief executive officer of Sergeant’s. “The formulated pet treats category is an area of great opportunity for Sergeant’s, and expanding our production capacity will put us in a unique position to meet increased consumer demand.”
MGP Ingredients purchased the Kansas City facility, located at 16 Kansas Avenue, in February 2001. It was previously owned by Thompson’s Nutritional Technology, Inc. In addition to manufacturing and packaging space and equipment, the facility includes administrative offices, a product testing and quality assurance lab, warehousing and shipping areas, and material storage silos. The entire complex is situated on a 27-acre site.  MGPI will retain an underdeveloped portion of the site, representing approximately half of that acreage.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

MGP of Indiana

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

MGP of Indiana (Midwest Grain Products of Indiana[1]) is a distillery in Lawrenceburg, Indiana producing spirits for private label sale.[2][3] These are sold under about 50 different brand names by various bottling companies but none under its own name.[4] Some of these are misleadingly marketed as small batch brands by artisanal "craft" microdistilleries.[4] The facility's master distiller is Greg Metze,[5][2] and its largest customer is the London-based multinational beverage giant Diageo.[6]
History[edit]
The distillery was founded in 1847[citation needed] and purchased by Seagram in 1933.[7] While under their ownership, the distillery was called the Jos. E. Seagram Lawrenceburg Plant. When Seagram went out of business, its assets were acquired by other companies, and the Lawrenceburg distillery became the property of Pernod Ricard.
On April 19, 2006, Pernod Ricard announced plans to close the distillery, but instead sold it in 2007 to CL Financial, a holding company based in Trinidad and Tobago, which renamed it "Lawrenceburg Distillers Indiana" (LDI). CL Financial later collapsed and required government intervention, although the facility continued to operate through the company crisis.
In October 2011, MGP Ingredients announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase the distillery, giving it its present name.[8] As of 2012, Diageo is the distillery's biggest customer.[6]
Products[edit]
MGP of Indiana does not have any brands of its own at present. It sells its output to various bottlers.[4] One primary product of MGP Indiana is a straight rye whiskey with a 95% rye mash bill, which is bottled under various brand names, including Angel's Envy, Bulleit Rye, Filibuster, George Dickel Rye, High West, James E. Pepper, Redemption, Smooth Ambler, and Templeton Rye.[4][6] It also produces straight Bourbon whiskey, which is sold under various brand names, such as the Cougar Bourbon brand sold in Australia. These straight whiskeys are also used as the straight whiskey components in Seagram's Seven Crown, a blended whiskey now produced by Diageo. The distillery also produces neutral spirits used in the production of Seagram-branded gin and vodka, now owned by Pernod Ricard.
In April 2013, MGP announced the introduction six additional mash bills for rye, malt, wheat and bourbon whiskey to expand the range of product offerings for the Indiana facility.[5][2]
Altogether, MGP is the source of beverage spirits sold under about 50 different brand names, although these are often sold misleadingly by their bottlers as distinctive products with minimal disclosure of the actual source of the spirits.[4] Some industry experts have commented negatively about the practice, such as the whiskey writer Charles Cowdery who has decried such bottlers as "Potemkin distilleries".[4] As one example, in a class action settlement announced in 2015 about the marketing of the Templeton Rye brand which was actually produced using MGP spirits, Templeton was required add the words "distilled in Indiana" to its label and remove claims of using a "Prohibition Era Recipe" and "small batch" production. The settlement also offered refunds to customers who had bought Templeton Rye since 2006.[9]
Some brands modify the facility's products somewhat before bottling and selling them. George Dickel Rye, introduced in 2012, is mashed, distilled and aged in Indiana at MGP, and then trucked to the Diageo bottling plant in Plainfield, Illinois for filtering and bottling.[6][10][11] Angel's Envy finishes its spirits in old rum casks before bottling.[4]

Frequently Asked Questions
Q: How many boxes should I order?
We recommend you stock up while today's savings are available by choosing either our three- or six-box money-saving packages. These “Special Discount” bundle packages will have you saving up to 20% off the single box price when you purchase your BioTrust Protein Cookies today. Additionally, these packages allow you to take advantage of our lowest possible prices while supplies last, without the worry of increasing prices and/or additional shipping fees later.
Q: What specifically makes BioTrust Protein Cookies such a premium, healthy, fat-burning snack?
BioTrust Protein Cookies…

Each cookie contains 12 grams of fat-fighting, time-released quality protein.
The proteins are hormone-free, sourced from cows not treated with dangerous, genetically engineered growth hormones like rBGH and rBST (not the case for the majority of all other protein products).
BioTrust Protein Cookies are free of artificial sweeteners, colors, and flavors.
They’re also gluten-free and GMO-free.
Did we mention they taste AMAZING? :-)

Q: What flavors are available?
BioTrust Protein Cookies come in two outrageously delicious flavors: Frosted Oatmeal Raisin and Chewy Chocolate Chip.
Q: How many cookies come in a box?
Each box of BioTrust Protein Cookies contains 12 large, individually wrapped high-protein cookies.
Q: What are the nutrition facts?

Q: What is the best way to use this product? 
Use 2 BioTrust Protein Cookies as a full meal replacement or snack. Each large cookie is individually wrapped, so they're ultra-convenient and portable on top of being extraordinarily delicious and healthy.
Q: Are there any allergy concerns with this product? 
Like every BioTrust product, BioTrust Protein Cookies are made with natural ingredients. Our cookie recipes do not include any ingredients from fish, or Crustacean shellfish. Independent laboratory testing ensures potency and purity. GMP quality assured. No sugar, artificial sweeteners, flavors, colors or preservatives added. It’s also Gluten-Free and non-GMO.
Oatmeal Raisin CONTAINS: Milk, egg and soy (lecithin).
Chewy Chocolate Chip CONTAINS: Milk, egg, tree nut (coconut) and soy (lecithin).
These products are manufactured in a facility that also processes peanuts and wheat. Of note, soy lecithin serves as an emulsifier and is purified to effectively reduce the allergenic components associated with soy products.
Q: Should I keep taking this product after I achieve my weight goal? 
BioTrust Protein Cookies are a healthy, nutritious snack that can be used as part of your weight loss plan or a weight maintenance plan.  They are a true, good-for-you delicious snack that your entire family will enjoy!
Q: How will this product be shipped to me and how quickly?
We will ship your order directly to your home or office using a premium carrier such as FedEx or UPS, and customers in the US and Canada can expect their orders within 5 to 7 business days. International orders typically take 8 – 15 business days (plus customs clearance time). Rush shipping is available.
Q: Will anything else be sent to me, or billed to me, after I order? 
No. This is NOT an auto-ship program. You only get shipped what you order today and nothing more.
Q: Is it safe to order online from your web site? 
Yes. We use a 256-bit secure shopping cart where 100% of your data is encrypted, safe and secure. Our secure cart is verified by numerous 3rd party security verification systems, including the leader in security scanning, McAfee Secure, so you can rest assured that your information is 100% safe and secure at all times.

“As a trainer who works with professional athletes it's critically important that I have a brand of nutrition products I trust to recommend to my clients—that brand is BioTrust Nutrition. The testing and research that goes in to each product, along with NSF and GMP quality certifications make them the only brand I'll send my million dollar players to.”
-Dan Long
Tampa, Florida


“At my practice here in Indiana, and with all my weight loss clients all over the world, we trust BioTrust. With the quality control they have in place, along with the extraordinary amount of time and research that goes in to each product formulation, it's a no-brainer for me to recommend BioTrust to both my clients and patients alike.”
-Dr. Charlie Livingston
Carmel, Indiana


“As a Nutrition Specialist, I'm extremely picky about which supplements I recommend to my clients. The poor standards of many supplement companies and low quality ingredients are a joke, but Biotrust is different, with some of the highest quality ingredients in the industry. Also, their formulas are top notch, all backed 100% with legitimate science.”
-Mike Geary
Author, Truth About Abs


“When you take extreme dedication to being on the cutting edge of health information and combine that with an unwavering commitment to designing and testing products backed by laboratory-research and real-world results, you have something special: a supplement company that's actually worth your time. BioTrust IS that company.”
-John Romaniello, CPT
New York City, New York


“I've been working with the owners of BioTrust for years, and I'm blown away by the “quality filter” on every product they produce. You can rest assured that the ingredients chosen for BioTrust products are top of the line and customer service is their #1 priority. A supplement company needs to see your health as their #1 priority, and these guys do.”
-Dr. Kareem Samhouri
San Francisco, CA
