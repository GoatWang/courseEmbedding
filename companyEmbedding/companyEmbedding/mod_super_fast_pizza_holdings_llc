This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our website, mobile application and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice, such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.


Collection of Information.



Information You Provide Us. We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, place an order or make a purchase, fill out a form, participate in contests, promotions or surveys, apply for a job, inquire about becoming an authorized operator (including, but not limited to, a franchisee), contact us about potential real estate locations, host a charity fundraiser at one of our stores or request charity donations from us, engage with us via third party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.
The types of information we may collect include:


your name, email address, phone number, postal address, ZIP code, birth date, MOD account username and password, social media usernames;


if you are applying for employment, your résumé information, such as employment and education history;


if you are inquiring about becoming our authorized operator, your net worth and restaurant operation experience;


if you are requesting our participation in a fundraising event or seeking charity donations from us, name and address of the charity organization, event details and tax exempt ID; or


any other information you choose to provide.




Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services. When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect certain information, including, but not limited to:


Transaction Information: When you place an order or make a purchase, we collect information about the transaction, such as the items ordered, the transaction amount, and the date and location of the store of your order. We may also collect and store limited payment information from you, such as payment card type, expiration date, and the last four digits of your card number; however, we do not collect or store full payment card numbers and all transactions are processed by our third-party payment processors.


Log Information: We collect log information about your access and use of our website, including but not limited to, your domain name, the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.


Device Information:  We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, such as the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, mobile network information, and browsing behavior.


Location Information: We may collect information about the precise location of your device each time you access or use our website or one of our mobile applications or otherwise consent to the collection of this information. For more details, please see “Your Choices” below.


Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: We and our service providers use various technologies, including cookies and web beacons, to collect information about you and our interaction with our Services, including information about your browsing and purchase behavior. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience on these Services, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see “Your Choices” below.




Information We Collect from Other Sources. We may also receive information about you from other sources and link or combine that with information we collect about you. For example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site or if you associate your social media account with your MOD account, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.


Information We Collect About Others. In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such as when you refer someone to our Services (such as for certain promotions), or when you make a purchase for others or specify items for others in your party. We will use this information to fulfill your requests and will not send communications to your contacts unrelated to your requests, unless they separately consent to receive communications from us.



Use of Information. We may use information about you for various purposes, including, but not limited, to:


Provide, maintain and improve our Services, including your in-store, online and mobile application ordering experience;


Provide and deliver the products and services you request, process orders, transactions and send you related information, including confirmations and receipts;


Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages;


Investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities;


Respond to your comments, questions, requests and provide customer service;


Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards, and events offered by MOD and others, and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you (for information about how to manage promotional communications, please see “Your Choices” below);


Monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities in connection with our Services;


Personalize and improve the Services and provide advertisements, content or features that match user profiles or interests;


Process and deliver contest and promotion entries and rewards;


Link or combine with information we get from others to help understand your needs and provide you with better service;


Assess and respond to employment, franchise/authorized operator, charity events or donations, or other applications; or


Carry out any other purpose for which the information was collected.


MOD is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.


Sharing of Information. We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:


With our affiliates, subsidiaries and authorized operators to provide products and services you request and to support our business function and authorized operator network;


With third-party vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;


In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;


If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of MOD or others;


In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, listing of our securities with a securities exchange, financing, reorganization, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company; and


With your consent or at your direction.


We may also use and share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.


Social Sharing Features. The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.


Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others. We may allow others to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by MOD and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity. For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices.
We may also work with third parties to serve you ads as part of a customized campaign on third-party platforms (such as Facebook or Twitter). As part of these ad campaigns, we may convert information about you, such as your email address and phone number, into a unique value that can be matched with a user account on these platforms to allow us to learn about your interests and to serve you advertisements customized to your interests. Note that the third-party platforms may offer you choices about whether you see these types of customized advertisements.


Security. MOD takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.


Your Choices.

If you wish to deactivate your account, please send an email to feedback@modpizza.com, and include your name, account name (if different), contact information, and a request to deactivate your account. Please note, however, that we may retain certain information that you provide through our Services as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. We also may retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time.


Cookies. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.


Location Information. When you first launch some of our mobile applications or visit one of the pages on our website that collect location information, you may be asked to consent to the collection of location information. If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can later stop this collection by changing the settings on your mobile device or Internet browser. If you do so, certain features of our Services will no longer function. You can also stop our collection of location information by our mobile application(s) by following the standard uninstall process and removing the MOD application(s) from your mobile device.


Promotional Communications. You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by editing the preferences of your account. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, your transactions or our ongoing business relations.


Mobile Push Notifications/Alerts. With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can elect to stop receiving these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.

MOD Super Fast Pizza Holdings, LLC, a pioneer of fast-casual pizza, and BBX Capital Corporation announced Friday that BBX Capital has joined its growing family of select franchisees. BBX Capital has created a new division with the goal of developing 50 or more MOD locations throughout central and southern Florida over the next seven years, including the major metropolitan markets of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, Orlando, and Tampa. With this agreement, MOD now has eight franchisees across the U.S., and commitments to open around 200 franchise locations in 12 states (California, Colorado, Missouri, Kansas, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Florida).
MOD currently has 152 locations across 18 states and the U.K. Founded by entrepreneurs Scott and Ally Svenson, MOD was inspired by the couple’s love of Italian street-style pizza, their desire for authentic, affordable and fast dining options for their busy family and the idea that a great company could be built around people. The Svensons bring their experience from building two highly successful concepts—Seattle Coffee Company and Carluccio’s. MOD’s team of advisors and executives bring experience from iconic brands such as Starbucks, Apple, Disney, McDonald’s, Dunkin Donuts, and T-Mobile.
BBX Capital has extensive financial, real estate, hospitality and restaurant experience. In addition to its real estate portfolio, the company currently owns Bluegreen Corporation, a vacation ownership company, Hoffman’s Chocolates, a manufacturer of gourmet chocolates with retail locations throughout South Florida, and BBX Sweet Holdings, a portfolio of candy companies throughout the United States. BBX Capital previously owned BankAtlantic, one of the largest and oldest retail banks headquartered in the state of Florida.
“For MOD, the single most critical factor is ensuring that our franchisees echo our belief in the value of a strong and vibrant culture in our stores. We continue to have a simple goal in our franchising strategy—to build deep relationships with a select and limited set of distinguished franchisees,” says Scott Svenson, co-founder and CEO of MOD Pizza. “We are humbled that the team at BBX Capital has joined the MOD family and share our desire to build something new and very special. We know they have the local market expertise and experience to help us spread the MOD culture across their home state of Florida.”
MOD, with a business strategy of predominantly building company-owned stores, complemented with a select group of culturally aligned and highly experienced franchisees, is nearing the completion of its team of U.S. franchisees. “With the addition of one or two more U.S. franchisees, which would bring our total to 10, we will have solidified our network of operators who will help us grow across the country,” adds John Dikos, vice president of partnerships of MOD Pizza.
“MOD has established itself as a leader in the fast casual pizza category while offering consumers an authentic, affordable and fast dining experience,” says Jarett Levan, president of BBX Capital. “MOD’s strong brand, people-first culture, and best-in-class customer service has positioned MOD very well for continued growth, and we are very excited to be teaming with Scott and Ally, and the entire MOD family to bring the concept to Florida.”

MOD Super Fast Pizza Holdings, LLC announced 2016 year-end results that reflect continued new store growth and strong performance from existing stores. During the 2016 fiscal year, MOD added 100 locations system-wide and achieved same-store sales growth of 5.3 percent, bringing its combined two-year same-store sales growth to over 18 percent. System-wide sales reached $152 million reflecting a year-over-year increase of 134 percent while company net revenue hit $131 million, up 116 percent over 2015.
To support its rapid growth, MOD raised $74 million of private equity capital during 2016 from Fidelity Management & Research Company, PWP Growth Equity, and other existing investors. To date, MOD has raised over $150 million in total capital.
“2016 was another exceptional year for MOD with growth across our business. It is tremendously rewarding to see how our unique purpose-driven culture continues to generate industry-leading results as we bring MOD to new communities across the country and the United Kingdom,” says Scott Svenson, co-founder and CEO of MOD Pizza. “Our commitment to making a positive impact on our people and the communities we serve will continue to motivate our team as we focus on growing and improving the business in 2017.”
In addition to increasing its presence in existing markets, MOD expanded into six new states in 2016—Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin. The year also marked MOD’s first international expansion, with the opening of five locations in the United Kingdom with sites in Leeds, Brighton, Nottingham, Newcastle and a flagship location in London’s Leicester Square.
New store growth created over 2,000 jobs company-wide, bringing total jobs created system-wide under the MOD brand to more than 4,000. MOD significantly strengthened its executive team in 2016, adding four key individuals: Bob Barton, chief financial officer; Carole McCluskey, chief technology officer; Lisa Luebeck, vice president of legal and general counsel; and Megan Hansen, vice president of people.
Two new multi-unit franchisees joined the MOD family in 2016—Food for Thought Restaurant Group that is expected to develop MOD in Florida and Southern Pie, LLC, which is expected to develop the brand in most of Georgia and all of Alabama. MOD now has nine franchisees with commitments to open 247 stores, and 32 were open at year-end.
MOD’s growth supported its ongoing commitment to Spread MODness by using the business as a platform for creating positive social change. To this end, MOD donated over $650,000 during the year to over 185 non-profits across the US, including, amongst many others, Generosity Feeds (Reston, Virginia) The Monarch Institute (Houston), Friends of Youth (Seattle) and Second Harvest Food Bank (San Jose). In 2016, Spreading MODness—the company’s annual campaign designed to spotlight the power of community giving and the importance of gratitude—supported over 185 community-based charities across the US. To date, MOD has now donated over $1 million to organizations supporting youth and families at risk in communities across the US.
The following definitions apply to these terms as used throughout this release:
System-wide: includes all company-operated and licensed store locations
MOD operates its business with 13 four week periods and a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday of December.
MOD’s fiscal year 2016 ended on December 25, 2016.

Seattle-based MOD Pizza is coming to Jacksonville with a location at Bartram Village.
Plans show the 2,284-square-foot restaurant will open at 12547 Bartram Park Blvd. It’s an estimated $400,000 build-out.
MOD Pizza has more than 200 locations in 20 states and five restaurants in the United Kingdom. 
The franchisee opening the Jacksonville store is Fort Lauderdale-based Food for Thought South LLC.
The chain was founded in 2008. It is privately owned with company-owned stores and franchises.
MOD says its gas-fired ovens cook at 800 degrees, so it only takes a few minutes to cook a pizza, depending on the number of toppings. 
The menu includes pizzas, salads and drinks.
In March, MOD Super Fast Pizza Holdings LLC announced 2016 year-end results that said it added 100 locations systemwide and achieved same-store sales growth of 5.3 percent.
It said two new multi-unit franchisees joined in 2016, including Food for Thought Restaurant Group to develop MOD in Florida.
As of March, MOD had nine franchisees with commitments to open 247 stores.
Lemonis concept Union73 to open as soon as possible
The Marcus Lemonis Fashion Group confirmed it will expand its operations to include the new Union73 retail concept boutique at the Denim & Soul space at 4742 River City Drive, No. 113, in St. Johns Town Center.
Joseph Gualtiere, communications director for Marcus Lemonis Fashion Group, said the store will open as soon as possible to offer “trendy, fast-fashion products at affordable prices.”
Union73 sells men’s and women’s clothing and is the brainchild of entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis, star of the CNBC reality series “The Profit.”
“We are excited to bring the new Union73 boutique to Jacksonville,” Lemonis said in a statement.
“Our goal is to be the go-to trendy retailer in this community” with a changing collection of well-known national-brand men’s and women’s fashions, he said.
He said Union73 is offering more than 1,500 pairs of jeans in all styles, washes and prices in Jacksonville to start the new concept.
The 7,000-square-foot boutique will feature denim, jackets, tops, sweaters, dresses and bottoms, as well as shoes, accessories and handbags, said a news release.
The release said the business model is focused on a strong commitment to one-on-one customer relationships.
Union73 operates in Chicago and Minneapolis, and more locations are planned.
On the show, Lemonis advises struggling small businesses around the country.
Denim & Soul opened last year in Jacksonville. Lemonis featured the store during Season 4 of “The Profit.”
Denim & Soul, selling jeans and high-end clothing and accessories, opened in the space vacated by the bankrupt Cachè. 
Lemonis also featured Jacksonville’s Sweet Pete’s candy store in 2014 on the show. He made a 50 percent investment in the business, which moved Downtown from Springfield.
Hyatt Place, Moe’s OK’d for The Strand at Town Center
As The Strand at Town Center continues to develop, the city approved construction for the Hyatt Place hotel at 4800 Town Center Parkway.
Kellogg & Kimsey Inc. is the contractor for the five-story, 90,738-square-foot hotel at a construction cost of $2 million.
In June, Capital Bank Corp. issued an $18.5 million mortgage to Concord Jacksonville TC LLC to develop the hotel. 
Raleigh, North Carolina-based Concord paid $4 million for the property in March, buying it from PGP Jacksonville TC LLC, a Preferred Growth Properties company.
Concord Hospitality Enterprises Co. filed plans last year to develop the 160-room Hyatt Place hotel on 2.79 acres.
Preferred Growth is the real estate subsidiary of Books-A-Million and is developing The Strand and The Crossing at Town Center.
Not far from Hyatt Place, the city approved construction of a shell building for Moe’s Southwest Grill at 4710 Town Center Parkway.
Dakenna Development Inc. is the contractor for the 2,760-square-foot structure at a construction cost of $250,000.
UPS warehouse wins $1.9 million permit
The city issued a permit to renovate office space and add dock positions at Westlake Industrial Park for United Parcel Service Inc. 
The Conlan Co. will add 40 dock positions and repair 60 more in a $1.9 million construction job to create a hub at 12400 Presidents Court. 
UPS is setting up the Westlake center to handle package processing as it expands its Westside Industrial Park hub.
RaceTrac, Wawa moving forward
RaceTrac Petroleum Inc. was issued a concurrency reservation certificate for a 5,411-square-foot gas station and convenience store on 2.4 acres at 2005 Mayport Road. It will offer 20 vehicle fueling positions.
Wawa was issued a concurrency reservation certificate for a 5,636-square-foot gas station and convenience store on 5.15 acres at 2500 Monument Road. It will offer 16 vehicle fueling positions. Site plans show Wawa on 1.82 acres of the site. Three additional lots of just more than acre each are shown west of Wawa along McCormick Road.
Wawa filed site plans for a 6,119-square-foot gas station and convenience store on 2.49 acres at 13363 Beach Blvd. Plans show Wawa on 1.71 acres and an outparcel of 0.78 acre.
