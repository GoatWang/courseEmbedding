		day and time. If the second delivery attempt is unsuccessful a further
		charge of £7.50 will have to be made for the third delivery attempt. We can deliver to your work address
		if this is more convenient or you may choose to use your neighbours' address
		if you are not going to be at home. When
		you reach the shopping cart area an option for to specify a delivery address is available. 
Goods are delivered by third-party national carriers. In the unlikely event of damage to your property in the course of delivery, the responsibility rests solely with the carrier.
Due to the fact we have no control over carrier delivery times it is
		unadvisable to book Plumbers, Electricians or any other trades prior to
		actually receiving your goods, otherwise late deliveries could add unnecessary
		extra expense of which hsdOnline will not be responsible for and no compensation
		will be paid under these unfortunate circumstances by HSD.
A charge of £7.49 + VAT will be made for delivery to the UK mainland (except where stated). For delivery to other regions/countries a higher charge may apply.

Price match

Price Watch Guarantee 
To the best of our knowledge our published prices are the best on the internet, and our marketing department constantly monitor the Internet to make sure they stay this way.
		If you do find the same product on sale on the Internet at a lower cost (on products where stated and inclusive of P&P) WE
		PROMISE TO BEAT THE PRICE.  Just call us on 0800 091 31 71 or send us an email to sales@hygienesuppliesdirect.com
		with the web site address and the description of the product; we will
		then contact you with a better offer.
Remember - to qualify for our price match promise the products must be an exact match (ie same brand, model, specification).
		Our definition of a lower price includes all P&P charges.  For example if a product is £99.99(+£24.99 P&P) on a competitiors site and on hsdOnline its £109.99(+£9.99 P&P)
		then the product does not qualify for our price promise as our our overall price (inclusive of P&P is still lower).
Our lowest price promise does not include competitions, sales, clearance sales, auction sites (eg. eBay), typographical
		errors, quantity discounts or special membership discounts. We must be
		supplied with a currently active website URL displaying the product and
		price. The product must be available for immediate sale and delivery.
