NEW YORK, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- This press release provides shareholders of Cohen & Steers Select Preferred and Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE:    PSF) (the "Fund") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on July 31, 2017 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date.








In December 2016, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.
The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.
At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.
The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.

You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's managed distribution policy. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates, are likely to change over time, and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The amounts and sources of distributions year-to-date may be subject to additional adjustments.
*THE FUND WILL SEND YOU A FORM 1099-DIV FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR THAT WILL TELL YOU HOW TO REPORT THESE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES
The Fund's Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return for fiscal year 2017 (January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017) is set forth below. Shareholders should take note of the relationship between the Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return with the Fund's Cumulative Distribution Rate for 2017. In addition, the Fund's Average Annual Total Return for the five-year period ending June 30, 2017 is set forth below. Shareholders should note the relationship between the Average Annual Total Return with the Fund's Current Annualized Distribution Rate for 2017. The performance and distribution rate information disclosed in the table is based on the Fund's net asset value per share (NAV). The Fund's NAV is calculated as the total market value of all the securities and other assets held by the Fund minus the total liabilities, divided by the total number of shares outstanding. While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's individual investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.

Cohen & Steers (NYSE:CNS)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



NEW YORK, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- This press release provides shareholders of Cohen & Steers Select Preferred and Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: PSF) (the "Fund") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on July 31, 2017 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date.
In December 2016, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares.
The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions.
At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year.
The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share.

You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's managed distribution policy. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates, are likely to change over time, and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The amounts and sources of distributions year-to-date may be subject to additional adjustments.
*THE FUND WILL SEND YOU A FORM 1099-DIV FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR THAT WILL TELL YOU HOW TO REPORT THESE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES
The Fund's Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return for fiscal year 2017 (January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017) is set forth below. Shareholders should take note of the relationship between the Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return with the Fund's Cumulative Distribution Rate for 2017. In addition, the Fund's Average Annual Total Return for the five-year period ending June 30, 2017 is set forth below. Shareholders should note the relationship between the Average Annual Total Return with the Fund's Current Annualized Distribution Rate for 2017. The performance and distribution rate information disclosed in the table is based on the Fund's net asset value per share (NAV). The Fund's NAV is calculated as the total market value of all the securities and other assets held by the Fund minus the total liabilities, divided by the total number of shares outstanding. While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's individual investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.

1.


Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over the year-to-date time period including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of those distributions.



2.


Cumulative Distribution Rate for the Fund's current fiscal period (January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017) measured on the dollar value of distributions in the year-to-date period as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of June 30, 2017.



3.


Average Annual Total Return represents the compound average of the Annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the five-year period ending June 30, 2017. Annual NAV Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV over a year including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of those distributions.



4.


The Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the current fiscal period's distribution rate annualized as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of June 30, 2017.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expense of the fund carefully before investing. You can obtain the fund's most recent periodic reports, when available, and other regulatory filings by contacting your financial advisor or visiting cohenandsteers.com. These reports and other filings can be found on the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR Database. You should read these reports and other filings carefully before investing. 
Shareholders should not use the information provided in preparing their tax returns. Shareholders will receive a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year indicating how to report Fund distributions for federal income tax purposes.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 41 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks total return.




Strategy



The fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in a portfolio of preferred and debt securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. companies. It also will invest at least 25% of its net assets in the financial sector. The fund may invest without limit in securities of non-U.S. companies, which may be non-U.S. dollar denominated, including up to 15% of the fund's net assets in securities issued by companies domiciled in emerging market countries.


Risk



Preferred stocks have characteristics of both stocks and bonds, and therefore may be subject to the risks of both the equity and bond markets.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Preferred stocks may also be subject to credit and interest rate risk (As interest rates rise, the price of preferred stock may fall, and vice versa.). Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Preferred stocks have characteristics of both stocks and bonds, and therefore may be subject to the risks of both the equity and bond markets.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Preferred stocks may also be subject to credit and interest rate risk (As interest rates rise, the price of preferred stock may fall, and vice versa.). Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit  and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. The funds on the Fund Picks From Fidelity® list are selected based on certain selection criteria. Fund Picks From Fidelity is not a personalized recommendation or endorsement of any fund for an investor's individual circumstances.
3. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
4. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
5. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
6. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
7. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
8. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
9. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
10. Fixed Income StyleMap® StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

*Blended Index consists of 50% FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index and 50% BofA Merrill Lynch Fixed Rate Preferred Index.
Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The rate of return will vary and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate and shares, if sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Returns are historical and include change in share price and reinvestment of all distributions. An investor cannot invest directly in an index and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes.
Performance results reflect the effects of leverage, which can positively impact performance in an up market and negatively impact performance in a down market. Periods greater than 12 months are annualized.  Returns are historical and include change in share price and reinvestment of all distributions.  
The FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index is an unmanaged, market-capitalization-weighted index of all publicly traded U.S. REITs that invest predominantly in the equity ownership of real estate, not including timber and infrastructure. The index is designed to reflect the performance of all publicly traded equity REITs as a whole.
The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index of 500 large-cap stocks that is frequently used as a general measure of stock market performance. It includes 500 large-cap stocks, which together represent about 75% of the total U.S. equities market. To be eligible for addition to the S&P 500, companies must have a market capitalization of at least US$ 4 billion.
The BofA Merrill Lynch Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index tracks the performance of fixed-rate U.S. dollar-denominated preferred securities issued in the U.S. domestic market. Qualifying securities must be rated investment grade (based on an average of Moody's, S&P and Fitch) and must have an investment-grade-rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P and Fitch foreign currency long-term sovereign debt ratings).
An investor cannot invest directly in an index and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes

Estimates Only - Do Not Use for Tax Reporting Purposes
This table provides estimates of the Fund's distribution sources at the time of payment and should not be relied upon or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes. A return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. The source of all distributions paid by the Fund, including net investment income, is subject to change. This is because the Fund primarily invests in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and similar companies. Distributions from REITs are attributed to various sources including net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. The estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the REIT securities held by the Fund. The Fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year.
Income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from GAAP. As a result, distributions are subject to recharacterization for federal income tax purposes. As the Fund has a capital loss carryover, any distribution paid to shareholders that exceeds the total of the Fund’s investment company taxable income must be characterized as ordinary income, up to the amount of the Fund’s net capital gain realized during the calendar year. This would cause a distribution that is classified as a return of capital under GAAP to be reported as ordinary income for tax purposes.
The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after year-end and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV and these final amounts may vary significantly from the estimates provided above. Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year, will specify how the distributions paid by the Fund during the year should be characterized and reported on your tax return (e.g. ordinary income, return of capital and capital gain).




Important Information
NOT FDIC INSURED • MAY LOSE VALUE • NO BANK GUARANTEE
Leverage represented as a percentage of the Fund’s managed assets as of the most recent month end. Leverage is created whenever a closed-end fund has investment exposure in excess of its net assets. The use of leverage is speculative and there are special risks and costs associated with leverage. The use of leverage increases the volatility of the Fund's net asset value in both up and down markets. The Fund seeks to enhance its dividend yield through leverage but there is no guarantee that the Fund's leverage strategy will be successful.  
Expense ratios as disclosed in the Fund’s most recent annual report to stockholders dated December 31, 2016. Expense ratios are net of waivers and/or reimbursements.
Portfolio holdings are subject to change without notice. The mention of specific securities is not a recommendation or solicitation for any person to buy, sell or hold any particular security.  Top ten holdings are determined on the basis of the value of individual securities held. The Fund may also hold positions in other types of securities issued by the companies listed above. You can obtain a complete listing of holdings by clicking here.
NAV per share is as of the prior day’s market close of regular trading on the NYSE, generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.
Distribution Rate is calculated dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by the market price. Note that the number of income distributions is based on the fund’s distribution payment frequency (i.e. monthly or quarterly). A fund may pay distributions in excess of its net investment company taxable income and, to the extent this occurs, the distribution yield quoted will include a return of capital. The estimated return of capital for each distribution is also available on this Web site by clicking on the Distributions tab on each fund’s landing page.
SEC yield is calculated by dividing annualized net investment income per share during a 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share as of the close of that period. SEC yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities. Since certain distributions received by the funds from real estate investment trusts (REITs) may consist of dividend income, return of capital and capital gains, and the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the year, the SEC yield has been adjusted for the funds that invest significantly in REITs based on estimates of return of capital and capital gains.
Quarterly distribution per share is as of the most recent quarter  end. The fund pays regular quarterly cash distributions to common shareholders at a level rate that may be adjusted from time to time, based on the projected income of the fund. The amount of quarterly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions. Each fund’s distributions reflect net investment income, and may also include net realized capital gains and/or return of capital. Return of capital includes distributions paid by a fund in excess of its net investment income and such excess is distributed from the fund’s assets. Under federal tax regulations, some or all of the return of capital distributed by a fund may be taxed as ordinary income.
In addition, distributions for funds investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to each fund after year-end by REITs held by a fund.
However, please note that distributions are subject to recharacterization for tax purposes and the final tax treatment of these distributions will be reported to shareholders after the close of each fiscal year on form 1099-DIV.
Risks of Investing in Real Estate Securities
Risks of investing in real estate securities are similar to those associated with direct investments in real estate, including falling property values due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from economic, legal, political or technological developments, lack of liquidity, limited diversification and sensitivity to certain economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessions. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations, lower liquidity, political and economic uncertainties, and differences in accounting standards. Some international securities may represent small- and medium-sized companies, which may be more susceptible to price volatility and less liquidity than larger companies.
Risks of Investing in Preferred Securities
Investing in any market exposes investors to risks. In general, the risks of investing in preferred securities are similar to those of investing in bonds, including credit risk and interest-rate risk. As nearly all preferred securities have issuer call options, call risk and reinvestment risk are also important considerations. In addition, investors face equity-like risks, such as deferral or omission of distributions, subordination to bonds and other more senior debt, and higher corporate governance risks with limited voting rights. The fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund under the federal securities laws because it can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified fund.  However, the fund must meet certain diversification requirements under the U.S. tax laws.
Preferred securities may be rated below investment-grade or may be unrated.  Below-investment-grade securities or equivalent unrated securities generally involved greater volatility of price and risk of loss of income and principal, and may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic or competitive industry conditions than higher-grade securities.
Risks associated with preferred securities differ from risks inherent with other investments. In particular, in the event of bankruptcy, a company’s preferred securities are senior to common  stock but subordinated to all other types of corporate debt.  Throughout this presentation we will make comparisons of preferred securities to corporate bonds, municipal bonds and 10-Year Treasury bonds.  It is important to note that corporate bonds sit higher in the capital structure than preferred securities, and therefore in the event of bankruptcy will be senior to the preferred securities.  Municipal bonds are issued and backed by state and local governments and their agencies, and the interest from municipal securities is often free from both state and local income taxes.  10-Year Treasury bonds are issued by the U.S. government and are generally considered the safest of all bonds since they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government as to timely payment of principal and interest.
Risks of Investing in Closed-End Funds
Risks associated with investing in closed-end end funds generally include market risk, leverage risk, risk of anti-takeover provisions and non-diversification. In addition, shares of many closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value.

*Blended Index consists of 50% BofA Merrill Lynch Capital Securities Index and 50% BofA Merrill Lynch Fixed Rate Preferred Index.
Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The rate of return will vary and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate and shares, if sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Returns are historical and include change in share price and reinvestment of all distributions. An investor cannot invest directly in an index and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes. 
Performance results reflect the effects of leverage, which can positively impact performance in an up market and negatively impact performance in a down market. 
Periods greater than 12 months are annualized. Returns are historical and include change in share price and reinvestment of all distributions.  
Index returns are presented net of withholding taxes for all periods available.  
The BofA Merrill Lynch Fixed Rate Preferred Securities Index tracks the performance of fixed-rate U.S. dollar-denominated preferred securities issued in the U.S. domestic market. Qualifying securities must be rated investment grade (based on an average of Moody's, S&P and Fitch) and must have an investment-grade-rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P and Fitch foreign currency long-term sovereign debt ratings). 
The BofA Merrill Lynch Capital Securities Index is a subset of The BofA Merrill Lynch US Corporate Index including all fixed-to-floating rate, perpetual callable and capital securities. You cannot invest directly in an index, and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes. 
Benchmark returns are shown for comparative purposes only and may not necessarily be representative of the Fund's portfolio. 
An investor cannot invest directly in an index and index performance does not reflect the deduction of any fees, expenses or taxes.

Estimates Only - Do Not Use for Tax Reporting Purposes
This table provides estimates of the Fund's distribution sources at the time of payment and should not be relied upon or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes. A return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. The source of all distributions paid by the Fund, including net investment income, is subject to change. This is because the Fund primarily invests in real estate investment trusts (REITs) and similar companies. Distributions from REITs are attributed to various sources including net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. The estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the REIT securities held by the Fund. The Fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year.
Income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from GAAP. 
The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after year-end and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV and these final amounts may vary significantly from the estimates provided above. Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year, will specify how the distributions paid by the Fund during the year should be characterized and reported on your tax return (e.g. ordinary income, return of capital and capital gain).




Important Information
NOT FDIC INSURED • MAY LOSE VALUE • NO BANK GUARANTEE
Leverage represented as a percentage of the Fund’s managed assets as of the most recent month end. Leverage is created whenever a closed-end fund has investment exposure in excess of its net assets. The use of leverage is speculative and there are special risks and costs associated with leverage. The use of leverage increases the volatility of the Fund's net asset value in both up and down markets. The Fund seeks to enhance its dividend yield through leverage but there is no guarantee that the Fund's leverage strategy will be successful.  
Expense ratios as disclosed in the Fund’s most recent annual report to stockholders dated December 31, 2016. Expense ratios are net of waivers and/or reimbursements.
Portfolio holdings are subject to change without notice. The mention of specific securities is not a recommendation or solicitation for any person to buy, sell or hold any particular security.  Top ten holdings are determined on the basis of the value of individual securities held. The Fund may also hold positions in other types of securities issued by the companies listed above. You can obtain a complete listing of holdings by clicking here.
NAV per share is as of the prior day’s market close of regular trading on the NYSE, generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.
Distribution Rate is calculated dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by the market price. Note that the number of income distributions is based on the fund’s distribution payment frequency (i.e. monthly or quarterly). A fund may pay distributions in excess of its net investment company taxable income and, to the extent this occurs, the distribution yield quoted will include a return of capital. The estimated return of capital for each distribution is also available on this Web site by clicking on the Distributions tab on each fund’s landing page.
SEC yield is calculated by dividing annualized net investment income per share during a 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share as of the close of that period. SEC yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities. Since certain distributions received by the funds from real estate investment trusts (REITs) may consist of dividend income, return of capital and capital gains, and the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the year, the SEC yield has been adjusted for the funds that invest significantly in REITs based on estimates of return of capital and capital gains.
Quarterly distribution per share is as of the most recent quarter  end. The fund pays regular quarterly cash distributions to common shareholders at a level rate that may be adjusted from time to time, based on the projected income of the fund. The amount of quarterly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions. Each fund’s distributions reflect net investment income, and may also include net realized capital gains and/or return of capital. Return of capital includes distributions paid by a fund in excess of its net investment income and such excess is distributed from the fund’s assets. Under federal tax regulations, some or all of the return of capital distributed by a fund may be taxed as ordinary income.
In addition, distributions for funds investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) may later be characterized as capital gains and/or a return of capital, depending on the character of the dividends reported to each fund after year-end by REITs held by a fund.
However, please note that distributions are subject to recharacterization for tax purposes and the final tax treatment of these distributions will be reported to shareholders after the close of each fiscal year on form 1099-DIV.
Risks of Investing in Preferred Securities
Investing in any market exposes investors to risks. In general, the risks of investing in preferred securities are similar to those of investing in bonds, including credit risk and interest-rate risk. As nearly all preferred securities have issuer call options, call risk and reinvestment risk are also important considerations. In addition, investors face equity-like risks, such as deferral or omission of distributions, subordination to bonds and other more senior debt, and higher corporate governance risks with limited voting rights. The fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund under the federal securities laws because it can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified fund.  However, the fund must meet certain diversification requirements under the U.S. tax laws.
Preferred securities may be rated below investment-grade or may be unrated.  Below-investment-grade securities or equivalent unrated securities generally involved greater volatility of price and risk of loss of income and principal, and may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic or competitive industry conditions than higher-grade securities.
Risks associated with preferred securities differ from risks inherent with other investments. In particular, in the event of bankruptcy, a company’s preferred securities are senior to common  stock but subordinated to all other types of corporate debt.  Throughout this presentation we will make comparisons of preferred securities to corporate bonds, municipal bonds and 10-Year Treasury bonds.  It is important to note that corporate bonds sit higher in the capital structure than preferred securities, and therefore in the event of bankruptcy will be senior to the preferred securities.  Municipal bonds are issued and backed by state and local governments and their agencies, and the interest from municipal securities is often free from both state and local income taxes.  10-Year Treasury bonds are issued by the U.S. government and are generally considered the safest of all bonds since they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government as to timely payment of principal and interest.
Risks of Investing in Closed-End Funds
Risks associated with investing in closed-end end funds generally include market risk, leverage risk, risk of anti-takeover provisions and non-diversification. In addition, shares of many closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value.
Risks of Investing in Foreign Securities
Special risks of investing in foreign securities include (i) currency fluctuations, (ii) lower liquidity, (iii) political and economic uncertainties, and (iv) differences in accounting standards. Some international securities may represent small- and medium-sized companies, which may be more susceptible to price volatility and less liquid than larger companies.
