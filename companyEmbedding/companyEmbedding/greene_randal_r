Randal R. Greene has joined Bay Banks of Virginia and its family of companies, Bank of Lancaster and Bay Trust Company, announces Robert R. Hurliman, Chairman of the Bay Banks Board of Directors.

He was also elected to serve on the Boards of Bay Banks, Bank of Lancaster and Bay Trust Company.
	In making this announcement, Hurliman stated that President and CEO Kenneth O. Bransford, Jr. had expressed his desire to retire in 2009 and at the request of the Board of Directors, he agreed to extend his retirement plans to the end of this year. “Ken has a 40-year tenure with our Company and has brought a great deal of management, lending and retail administration expertise to his position.  The Directors, Officers and Staff are deeply indebted to Ken for his leadership and for the years of service he has given to not only our Company but to the communities we serve.  He is without doubt the epitome of a community banker.  With our desire to honor Ken’s request, we are extremely pleased to have found an individual with the banking and management experience of Randal Greene.  We are excited to have him join the Bay Banks family and share his counsel and plans for our Company’s continued growth and success.”
	Greene received his Bachelor of Business Administration from East Tennessee State University in 1982.  He began his banking career in 1984 and brings 27 years of community banking and management experience to his new position with the Bay Banks family.  Greene most recently was a Regional President of State of Franklin Bank, a division of Jefferson Federal Bank in Johnson City, Tennessee. From 1996 to 2008, he was President and CEO, Director and Founder of State of Franklin Savings Bank and Chairman of its Executive Committee.  
	Greene has substantial knowledge of successfully growing a community bank with experience in all areas of banking, including managing multiple teams, as a senior credit officer with years of direct experience working with regulatory agencies, 25 years of lending experience, and has been directly responsible for managing the asset quality of a $350 million community bank. 
	Active in civic and community programs, he has had a lifetime involvement in Boy Scouts of America and has served as President of the Sequoyah Council, which serves 17 counties in East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia.  He has also served as Chairman of the Silver Eagle Dinner for Boy Scouts of America.  Greene has served as the Leadership Chairman of United Way of East Tennessee, a Board member of Children’s Advocacy Center, Chairman and Board member of Comprehensive Community Services, Foundation Board member of East Tennessee State University, and Board member of the Johnson City/Washington County Chamber of Commerce.  He is the Past Chairman of the Johnson City Medical Center Foundation; Past Board member of the City of Johnson City Community Development Board; and the organizer of the Eastern Eight, a successful non-profit housing corporation.  
	Greene and his wife Kathy have a son in college, Randal, and a daughter, Kate, in the 8th grade. 
	Greene states, “My family and I are excited about our move to Virginia’s beautiful Northern Neck, where we look forward to making our home.   A community banker at heart, I’m extremely pleased to have the opportunity to join an organization so strongly and firmly rooted in the communities of the Northern Neck.  I look forward to working with this great organization and meeting and working with the residents of the communities we have been serving since 1930.  I consider this a wonderful opportunity and one I am honored to accept.”

                        Randal Greene completed a Bachelor of Commerce at Memorial University, concentrating in Information Systems and Management Science. His professional career has involved systems analysis, software development, project management and geographic information systems (GIS). Initially he worked in business database software for the company that is now xwave. Then Randal moved to ICAN, a company with software products for marine navigation and marine surveillance, and he held management positions involving internal IT, customer technical support and product software engineering. The geographic nature of ICAN’s software products sparked an interest in GIS, and he completed a full-time MSc in Geography at Memorial from 2008 to 2010. Randal’s MSc research concentrated on GIS and Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis for land management. Following graduation, he worked with the Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC), a not-for-profit conservation land trust, primarily on the Labrador Conservation Blueprint as a conservation analyst and GIS modeler. Then he worked on the Too Big To Ignore project, designing and developing a web-based information system with interactive mapping. Randal now provides GIS and software  consulting services through Feaver's Lane, with clients including Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement, NCC, Northeast Avalon Atlantic Coastal Action Plan and Islands Trust.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Utah:













Does Randall R Greene carry a valid contracting license?



Contractors in Utah are required to be licensed to perform work on residential properties. The Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing issues over fifty separate license classifications to contractors. Licensing standards in Utah are very strict, offering homeowners peace of mind when hiring contractors. Always check a contractor's references to avoid problems during a construction project. 
Randall R Greene currently holds license 349754-5301 , which was Inactive when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Utah?



Utah requires contractors to pass a business and law exam, as well as a trade exam to become licensed. Six hours of continuing education is required to maintain a license in the state. 











Your liability risk when hiring Randall R Greene



Utah requires licensed contractors to carry workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of both insurance certificates for your records before the start of any work.











Financial recourse when hiring Randall R Greene



Licensed contractors in Utah must obtain a surety bond before performing work on residential properties. Home owners can file a claim against this bond to recoup losses or damages in the event of faulty work.











What else should I know before hiring Randall R Greene



Utah requires license applicants to submit a credit report with their application.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Utah, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
