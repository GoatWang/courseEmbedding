Physician Office Partners, Inc. Helping Anesthesia Specialists Improve Revenue with Innovative Medical Billing Services Solution




 Overland Park, KS,  May 11, 2013 --(PR.com)-- Nationwide leader for medical billing services, Physician Office Partners, Inc. is now offering clients across the country access to their highly effective anesthesia billing solution. The company’s service combines the use of next-generation software along with years of in-house billing expertise to ensure that clients achieve an increase in their payments received for their services.Medical services providers across the US must keep vast billing databases for their previous patients. It can be a struggle for some growing providers to maintain an accurate database while attending to all necessary elements within the billing cycle. Therefore, companies are now missing out on revenue from previous patients as they meet the needs of those who are new to their practice. This can be a vital area improving revenue when companies partner with a billing technology specialist such as Physician Office Partners, Inc.Physician Office Partners, Inc. now provides anesthesia specialists with a full-service solution to their billing requirements. One of the leading advantages of the company’s service is that it both assures HIPAA compliance and provides medical offices with daily reports on the on-going status on various business areas, including insurance follow-ups, claims submission and management and payment postings. This full-service billing solution also provides medical service managers with a birds-eye view over the finances of their operations and offers supportive expertise throughout the billing cycle. Fast returns can now be made utilizing this next generation billing system.To learn more about the billing technology available through Physician Office Partners, Inc. please contact their company headquarters today.

What Our Team Members Sayabout life at POP 
 


POP is a great company to work for and has welcomed me from the moment I walked in the door.  In my short time here I have been promoted twice which proves that my hard work is not overlooked. The thing I enjoy the most is that in the midst of our constant growth and expansion POP’s Executive Leadership Team still takes the time to stop and recognize the people who helped get the company where we are today.



 
 


After six years at Physician Office Partners, I can honestly say that I really enjoy not only my job, but the atmosphere and people I am privileged to work with.  This is not a top-down type of environment. Employees are encouraged to make suggestions and work in a manner suited to their strengths.  Each of us is treated as an asset and not a commodity. POP is a great place to work!



 
 


In the short time that I have been at Physician Office Partners, I have never felt more welcomed by a company. The people here are so helpful and friendly, which makes for a pleasant day at the office. It’s refreshing to work for a company that recognizes the hard work and dedication that is put in by its employees.



 
 


Physician Office Partners provides an amazing work environment where everyone feels like they are a part of the team. My hard work doesn’t go unnoticed and in turn, it makes me more dedicated to my job. Being appreciated and feeling like you’re a part of something bigger is so refreshing and encouraging.



 
 


It is a pleasure working at Physician Office Partners. As an organization, POP has provided me quality work, a great environment and a fun learning opportunity to expand my work experience. The staff is helpful, supportive and encourages growth within the company. My time at POP has been wonderful and I look forward to being with this amazing team for a long time.



 
 


As someone with experience at multiple revenue cycle management companies, POP is by far the best one that I have worked for. This isn’t just because they have great knowledge of anesthesia billing, they also provide an enjoyable work environment. POP thrives on teamwork and collaboration which allows our employees to be successful.
