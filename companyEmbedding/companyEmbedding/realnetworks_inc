Culture    Benefits    Giving    Locations    Openings
It all started with RealPlayer more than twenty years ago. Since then, we’ve redefined how people connect with music, video, games, and more. From GameHouse, a creator of top mobile and social games to mobile messaging, music, video, and ringback tone services that reach millions of subscribers.

Come work for us.
 

Corporate Culture:
RealNetworks corporate culture is structured to run as a series of well-funded startup companies under the RealNetworks umbrella. Each of our business units – Mobile Services, Consumer Media, and Games – have unique brands and products tied together with our trademark dedication to sharing digital media through innovative, industry-leading technology. We believe in running lean and agile. When we moved to a brand new building in the summer of 2013, our new home was carefully designed to foster innovation and collaboration.
Although we have a work hard ethic, we also like to have fun. From cupcake-laden happy hours and Mariners game day at Safeco Field to festive family holiday events and our annual new year Kick Off Party, we know how to enjoy the best of Seattle and beyond! At year-end, our annual Food Drive to benefit Northwest Harvest brings out our competitive sides to battle hunger and often includes corporate leaders agreeing to somewhat outrageous stunts for achieving group donation goals.

Serving on the Foundation's Review Team is a great way to get to know other employees while giving back to the community.

    Our Story   


 












RealNetworks creates products and services that make it easier for people to access and enjoy digital media on the devices and platforms they choose to use.


Whether it's music, movies, games, live streaming video, or apps that help them keep close to the people who matter most, RealNetworks thrives on giving people the fresh and entertaining experiences they deserve—whenever, wherever they want.
We do this in two ways: directly to consumers through our applications and services and through partnerships with well-established businesses and mobile operators throughout the world.
Then
Many people know RealNetworks from way back in 1995, when we introduced RealAudio®, the first audio streaming solution for the Internet. Continued innovation led to generations of RealVideo® and what is now known as RealPlayer®.
Now
RealPlayer continues to provide millions of PC users worldwide with video entertainment, allowing them to download, manage and enjoy all of their media in one place. But RealPlayer is only one part of the story.
For smartphone users, RealTimes® brings memories to life by automatically creating video montages from their photos and videos. These RealTimes® Stories can be customized and shared with friends and family.
RealNetworks is also one of the largest creators, publishers, and distributors of casual games available through the global destinations of GameHouse® and Zylom.
And you may not realize that our technology powers audio, video, ringback tones, and messaging on more than 700 million mobile handsets from some of the world’s most popular mobile carriers.
These are just a few examples of the many ways in which we create innovative applications and services that make it easy for people to enjoy digital media—whenever and wherever they want. Ultimately, we feel that technology is a creative expression. This belief inspires our thinking and helps us create experiences that help people enjoy life a little more, and sometimes, help the world around us progress.

History[edit]
RealNetworks (then known as Progressive Networks) was founded in 1994 by an ex-Microsoft executive, Rob Glaser and a management team including Phil Barrett, Andy Sharpless, and Stephen Buerkle. The original goal of the company was to provide a distribution channel for politically progressive content. It evolved into a technology venture to leverage the Internet as an alternative distribution medium for audio broadcasts. Progressive Networks became RealNetworks in September 1997.
RealNetworks are pioneers in the streaming media markets and broadcast one of the earlier audio events over the Internet — a baseball game between the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners — on September 5, 1995. They announced streaming video technology in 1997. According to some accounts,[which?] by 2000, more than 85% of streaming content on the Internet was in the Real format.[4]
Despite this success, problems arose because Real's primary business model depended upon the sale of streaming media server software, and Microsoft and Apple were giving those products away. As servers from Microsoft and Apple became more capable, Real's server sales inevitably eroded.[5]
On January 20, 2000, RealNetworks, Inc. filed an injunction against Streambox, Inc. regarding the aforementioned company's product designed to convert Real Audio (.rm) formatted files to other formats.[6] On December 4, 2001, the company was to launch the first coordinated effort to sell and deliver music from major record labels over the Internet, part of a broader initiative by the company to develop subscription Internet services aimed at Web users with fast Internet connections.[7] In 2002, a strategic alliance was formed between RealNetworks and Sony Corporation to expand collaboration.[8] In October, 2005, Microsoft agreed to pay RealNetworks $460 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit.[9]
In August 2003, RealNetworks acquired Listen.com's Rhapsody music service, and renamed it RealRhapsody. It offered streaming music downloads for a monthly fee. In January 2004, RealNetworks announced the RealPlayer Music Store, featuring digital rights management (DRM) restricted music in the AAC file format. After some initial tries to push their own DRM scheme (named Helix DRM) onto all device manufacturers with the Creative Zen Xtra and the Sansa e200r as the only existing compliant devices, they sparked controversy by introducing a technology called Harmony that allowed their music to play on iPods as well as Microsoft Windows Media Audio DRM-equipped devices using a "wrapper" that would convert Helix DRM into the two other target DRM schemes.[citation needed]
The domain real.com attracted at least 67 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com study.[10]
On April 6, 2010, Rhapsody was spun off from RealNetworks.[citation needed]
In July 2013, RealNetworks acquired Slingo for $15.6 million.[11] The company introduced a mobile phone app called Listen in April 2014 that plays custom ringtones to those calling the user's phone.[12]
Headquarters[edit]




RealNetworks headquarters


RealNetworks has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington in the Home Plate Center building in SoDo across from Safeco Field, sharing the building with King5 and Logic 20/20 Consulting.[13][14]
Products and services[edit]
Subscription services[edit]
In 2000, one of the initial products, the download manager RealDownload, was already used for pushing small software, such as games, to subscribers' computers. On top of the subscription for RealDownload and using its RealVideo streaming technology, a service called GoldPass, including unlimited access for video snippets from ABC and movie previews, was offered to registered users for a monthly $10 fee.[15] More content was added through deals with CBS for the reality show Big Brother and NBA basketball.[citation needed]
After the dot-com bubble, RealNetworks cut most of the resources. Some of the content was lost, some was limited to local markets, e.g., Ministry of Sound was available only to UK subscribers. With the increase in broadband usage, RealNetworks started offering live broadcasts of CNN International, BBC World, Al-Jazeera etc., separately for prices between $6 and $12, or bundled in the SuperPass for about $35 a month depending on the market. Between 2003 and 2006, SuperPass included, for European subscribers, unlimited access to UEFA Champions League full-length game recordings.[citation needed]
RealDVD[edit]
On September 30, 2008, RealNetworks launched a new product called RealDVD. The software allows any user to save a copy of a DVD movie they own. The company was later found to have violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and RealNetworks' contract with the DVD Copy Control Association, as the software also allowed anyone to save a movie they do not legally own. (See RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Ass'n, Inc.).[16] The product's distribution was barred by a court injunction.[17][18]
Real Alternative[edit]
Real Alternative is a discontinued software bundle that allows users to play RealMedia files without installing RealPlayer.[19][20] The last version, 2.02, was released on February 19, 2010. It included Media Player Classic.[21][22]
Beginning in 2010, RealNetworks sued Hilbrand Edskes, a 26-year-old Dutch webmaster for having inserted hyperlinks to Real Alternative on his site www.codecpack.nl. RealNetworks alleges that Real Alternative is a reverse engineered package.[23] Meanwhile, Download.com[20] and FileHippo[19] continue to host the software product, unchallenged.[24]
In November 2011 RealNetworks' case against Edskes was dismissed and RealNetworks was ordered to pay him €48,000 in damages.[25][26] Details of the case and judgement have been published.[27]
RealTimes (formerly RealPlayer Cloud)[edit]
RealNetworks in September 2013 launched RealPlayer Cloud, a service that adds the ability to share videos recorded on smartphones and tablets. RealPlayer Cloud ties into the existing RealPlayer, however it also has a Web app and apps for Android, iOS and Roku. The service has 2GB of free cloud storage and more storage for a monthly fee.[28] It was renamed to RealTimes in May 2015, with a new focus on creating and sharing "Stories"—video collages of users' personal photos and videos, set to background music.[29]
Helix[edit]
Main article: Helix (multimedia project)
Helix is a suite of streaming media software and services intended for digital TV set-top boxes, mobile devices, as well as QuickTime, Flash and other programs.[30][31][32] It includes the Helix open-source code and the Helix Universal Server, which hosts, distributes and manages digital rights for multimedia content.[32] Helix competes with the Windows Media 9 Series from Microsoft, but has a greater emphasis on open-source.[31][32] Helix was announced in July 2002.[31] Support for mobile devices was added in November 2005.[33] It was discontinued in October 2014.[34]
GameHouse[edit]
Main article: GameHouse
RealNetworks entered the gaming market in October 2001 with RealArcade, a PC game distribution application that allows users to play casual video games for free for 60 minutes, then decide if they want to purchase it.[35][36] Many of the games were developed by GameHouse, which RealNetworks acquired for $35.6 million in 2004.[37] In 2010, RealNetworks re-launched its gaming division under the name Gamehouse.[38] It began focusing on social games, such as Facebook apps,[39] and in 2013 acquired casual casino games company, Slingo, for $15.6 million.[40]

History[edit]
RealNetworks (then known as Progressive Networks) was founded in 1994 by an ex-Microsoft executive, Rob Glaser and a management team including Phil Barrett, Andy Sharpless, and Stephen Buerkle. The original goal of the company was to provide a distribution channel for politically progressive content. It evolved into a technology venture to leverage the Internet as an alternative distribution medium for audio broadcasts. Progressive Networks became RealNetworks in September 1997.
RealNetworks are pioneers in the streaming media markets and broadcast one of the earlier audio events over the Internet — a baseball game between the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners — on September 5, 1995. They announced streaming video technology in 1997. According to some accounts,[which?] by 2000, more than 85% of streaming content on the Internet was in the Real format.[4]
Despite this success, problems arose because Real's primary business model depended upon the sale of streaming media server software, and Microsoft and Apple were giving those products away. As servers from Microsoft and Apple became more capable, Real's server sales inevitably eroded.[5]
On January 20, 2000, RealNetworks, Inc. filed an injunction against Streambox, Inc. regarding the aforementioned company's product designed to convert Real Audio (.rm) formatted files to other formats.[6] On December 4, 2001, the company was to launch the first coordinated effort to sell and deliver music from major record labels over the Internet, part of a broader initiative by the company to develop subscription Internet services aimed at Web users with fast Internet connections.[7] In 2002, a strategic alliance was formed between RealNetworks and Sony Corporation to expand collaboration.[8] In October, 2005, Microsoft agreed to pay RealNetworks $460 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit.[9]
In August 2003, RealNetworks acquired Listen.com's Rhapsody music service, and renamed it RealRhapsody. It offered streaming music downloads for a monthly fee. In January 2004, RealNetworks announced the RealPlayer Music Store, featuring digital rights management (DRM) restricted music in the AAC file format. After some initial tries to push their own DRM scheme (named Helix DRM) onto all device manufacturers with the Creative Zen Xtra and the Sansa e200r as the only existing compliant devices, they sparked controversy by introducing a technology called Harmony that allowed their music to play on iPods as well as Microsoft Windows Media Audio DRM-equipped devices using a "wrapper" that would convert Helix DRM into the two other target DRM schemes.[citation needed]
The domain real.com attracted at least 67 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com study.[10]
On April 6, 2010, Rhapsody was spun off from RealNetworks.[citation needed]
In July 2013, RealNetworks acquired Slingo for $15.6 million.[11] The company introduced a mobile phone app called Listen in April 2014 that plays custom ringtones to those calling the user's phone.[12]
Headquarters[edit]




RealNetworks headquarters


RealNetworks has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington in the Home Plate Center building in SoDo across from Safeco Field, sharing the building with King5 and Logic 20/20 Consulting.[13][14]
Products and services[edit]
Subscription services[edit]
In 2000, one of the initial products, the download manager RealDownload, was already used for pushing small software, such as games, to subscribers' computers. On top of the subscription for RealDownload and using its RealVideo streaming technology, a service called GoldPass, including unlimited access for video snippets from ABC and movie previews, was offered to registered users for a monthly $10 fee.[15] More content was added through deals with CBS for the reality show Big Brother and NBA basketball.[citation needed]
After the dot-com bubble, RealNetworks cut most of the resources. Some of the content was lost, some was limited to local markets, e.g., Ministry of Sound was available only to UK subscribers. With the increase in broadband usage, RealNetworks started offering live broadcasts of CNN International, BBC World, Al-Jazeera etc., separately for prices between $6 and $12, or bundled in the SuperPass for about $35 a month depending on the market. Between 2003 and 2006, SuperPass included, for European subscribers, unlimited access to UEFA Champions League full-length game recordings.[citation needed]
RealDVD[edit]
On September 30, 2008, RealNetworks launched a new product called RealDVD. The software allows any user to save a copy of a DVD movie they own. The company was later found to have violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and RealNetworks' contract with the DVD Copy Control Association, as the software also allowed anyone to save a movie they do not legally own. (See RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Ass'n, Inc.).[16] The product's distribution was barred by a court injunction.[17][18]
Real Alternative[edit]
Real Alternative is a discontinued software bundle that allows users to play RealMedia files without installing RealPlayer.[19][20] The last version, 2.02, was released on February 19, 2010. It included Media Player Classic.[21][22]
Beginning in 2010, RealNetworks sued Hilbrand Edskes, a 26-year-old Dutch webmaster for having inserted hyperlinks to Real Alternative on his site www.codecpack.nl. RealNetworks alleges that Real Alternative is a reverse engineered package.[23] Meanwhile, Download.com[20] and FileHippo[19] continue to host the software product, unchallenged.[24]
In November 2011 RealNetworks' case against Edskes was dismissed and RealNetworks was ordered to pay him €48,000 in damages.[25][26] Details of the case and judgement have been published.[27]
RealTimes (formerly RealPlayer Cloud)[edit]
RealNetworks in September 2013 launched RealPlayer Cloud, a service that adds the ability to share videos recorded on smartphones and tablets. RealPlayer Cloud ties into the existing RealPlayer, however it also has a Web app and apps for Android, iOS and Roku. The service has 2GB of free cloud storage and more storage for a monthly fee.[28] It was renamed to RealTimes in May 2015, with a new focus on creating and sharing "Stories"—video collages of users' personal photos and videos, set to background music.[29]
Helix[edit]
Main article: Helix (multimedia project)
Helix is a suite of streaming media software and services intended for digital TV set-top boxes, mobile devices, as well as QuickTime, Flash and other programs.[30][31][32] It includes the Helix open-source code and the Helix Universal Server, which hosts, distributes and manages digital rights for multimedia content.[32] Helix competes with the Windows Media 9 Series from Microsoft, but has a greater emphasis on open-source.[31][32] Helix was announced in July 2002.[31] Support for mobile devices was added in November 2005.[33] It was discontinued in October 2014.[34]
GameHouse[edit]
Main article: GameHouse
RealNetworks entered the gaming market in October 2001 with RealArcade, a PC game distribution application that allows users to play casual video games for free for 60 minutes, then decide if they want to purchase it.[35][36] Many of the games were developed by GameHouse, which RealNetworks acquired for $35.6 million in 2004.[37] In 2010, RealNetworks re-launched its gaming division under the name Gamehouse.[38] It began focusing on social games, such as Facebook apps,[39] and in 2013 acquired casual casino games company, Slingo, for $15.6 million.[40]

History[edit]
RealNetworks (then known as Progressive Networks) was founded in 1994 by an ex-Microsoft executive, Rob Glaser and a management team including Phil Barrett, Andy Sharpless, and Stephen Buerkle. The original goal of the company was to provide a distribution channel for politically progressive content. It evolved into a technology venture to leverage the Internet as an alternative distribution medium for audio broadcasts. Progressive Networks became RealNetworks in September 1997.
RealNetworks are pioneers in the streaming media markets and broadcast one of the earlier audio events over the Internet — a baseball game between the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners — on September 5, 1995. They announced streaming video technology in 1997. According to some accounts,[which?] by 2000, more than 85% of streaming content on the Internet was in the Real format.[4]
Despite this success, problems arose because Real's primary business model depended upon the sale of streaming media server software, and Microsoft and Apple were giving those products away. As servers from Microsoft and Apple became more capable, Real's server sales inevitably eroded.[5]
On January 20, 2000, RealNetworks, Inc. filed an injunction against Streambox, Inc. regarding the aforementioned company's product designed to convert Real Audio (.rm) formatted files to other formats.[6] On December 4, 2001, the company was to launch the first coordinated effort to sell and deliver music from major record labels over the Internet, part of a broader initiative by the company to develop subscription Internet services aimed at Web users with fast Internet connections.[7] In 2002, a strategic alliance was formed between RealNetworks and Sony Corporation to expand collaboration.[8] In October, 2005, Microsoft agreed to pay RealNetworks $460 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit.[9]
In August 2003, RealNetworks acquired Listen.com's Rhapsody music service, and renamed it RealRhapsody. It offered streaming music downloads for a monthly fee.

On April 6, 2010, Rhapsody was spun off from RealNetworks.[citation needed]
In July 2013, RealNetworks acquired Slingo for $15.6 million.[11] The company introduced a mobile phone app called Listen in April 2014 that plays custom ringtones to those calling the user's phone.[12]
Headquarters[edit]




RealNetworks headquarters


RealNetworks has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington in the Home Plate Center building in SoDo across from Safeco Field, sharing the building with King5 and Logic 20/20 Consulting.[13][14]
Products and services[edit]
Subscription services[edit]
In 2000, one of the initial products, the download manager RealDownload, was already used for pushing small software, such as games, to subscribers' computers. On top of the subscription for RealDownload and using its RealVideo streaming technology, a service called GoldPass, including unlimited access for video snippets from ABC and movie previews, was offered to registered users for a monthly $10 fee.[15] More content was added through deals with CBS for the reality show Big Brother and NBA basketball.[citation needed]
After the dot-com bubble, RealNetworks cut most of the resources. Some of the content was lost, some was limited to local markets, e.g., Ministry of Sound was available only to UK subscribers. With the increase in broadband usage, RealNetworks started offering live broadcasts of CNN International, BBC World, Al-Jazeera etc., separately for prices between $6 and $12, or bundled in the SuperPass for about $35 a month depending on the market. Between 2003 and 2006, SuperPass included, for European subscribers, unlimited access to UEFA Champions League full-length game recordings.[citation needed]
RealDVD[edit]
On September 30, 2008, RealNetworks launched a new product called RealDVD. The software allows any user to save a copy of a DVD movie they own. The company was later found to have violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and RealNetworks' contract with the DVD Copy Control Association, as the software also allowed anyone to save a movie they do not legally own. (See RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Ass'n, Inc.).[16] The product's distribution was barred by a court injunction.[17][18]
Real Alternative[edit]
Real Alternative is a discontinued software bundle that allows users to play RealMedia files without installing RealPlayer.[19][20] The last version, 2.02, was released on February 19, 2010. It included Media Player Classic.[21][22]
Beginning in 2010, RealNetworks sued Hilbrand Edskes, a 26-year-old Dutch webmaster for having inserted hyperlinks to Real Alternative on his site www.codecpack.nl. RealNetworks alleges that Real Alternative is a reverse engineered package.[23] Meanwhile, Download.com[20] and FileHippo[19] continue to host the software product, unchallenged.[24]
In November 2011 RealNetworks' case against Edskes was dismissed and RealNetworks was ordered to pay him €48,000 in damages.[25][26] Details of the case and judgement have been published.[27]
RealTimes (formerly RealPlayer Cloud)[edit]
RealNetworks in September 2013 launched RealPlayer Cloud, a service that adds the ability to share videos recorded on smartphones and tablets. RealPlayer Cloud ties into the existing RealPlayer, however it also has a Web app and apps for Android, iOS and Roku. The service has 2GB of free cloud storage and more storage for a monthly fee.[28] It was renamed to RealTimes in May 2015, with a new focus on creating and sharing "Stories"—video collages of users' personal photos and videos, set to background music.[29]
Helix[edit]
Main article: Helix (multimedia project)
Helix is a suite of streaming media software and services intended for digital TV set-top boxes, mobile devices, as well as QuickTime, Flash and other programs.[30][31][32] It includes the Helix open-source code and the Helix Universal Server, which hosts, distributes and manages digital rights for multimedia content.[32] Helix competes with the Windows Media 9 Series from Microsoft, but has a greater emphasis on open-source.[31][32] Helix was announced in July 2002.[31] Support for mobile devices was added in November 2005.[33] It was discontinued in October 2014.[34]
GameHouse[edit]
Main article: GameHouse
RealNetworks entered the gaming market in October 2001 with RealArcade, a PC game distribution application that allows users to play casual video games for free for 60 minutes, then decide if they want to purchase it.[35][36] Many of the games were developed by GameHouse, which RealNetworks acquired for $35.6 million in 2004.[37] In 2010, RealNetworks re-launched its gaming division under the name Gamehouse.[38] It began focusing on social games, such as Facebook apps,[39] and in 2013 acquired casual casino games company, Slingo, for $15.6 million.[40]

History[edit]
RealNetworks (then known as Progressive Networks) was founded in 1994 by an ex-Microsoft executive, Rob Glaser and a management team including Phil Barrett, Andy Sharpless, and Stephen Buerkle. The original goal of the company was to provide a distribution channel for politically progressive content. It evolved into a technology venture to leverage the Internet as an alternative distribution medium for audio broadcasts. Progressive Networks became RealNetworks in September 1997.
RealNetworks are pioneers in the streaming media markets and broadcast one of the earlier audio events over the Internet — a baseball game between the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners — on September 5, 1995. They announced streaming video technology in 1997. According to some accounts,[which?] by 2000, more than 85% of streaming content on the Internet was in the Real format.[4]
Despite this success, problems arose because Real's primary business model depended upon the sale of streaming media server software, and Microsoft and Apple were giving those products away. As servers from Microsoft and Apple became more capable, Real's server sales inevitably eroded.[5]
On January 20, 2000, RealNetworks, Inc. filed an injunction against Streambox, Inc. regarding the aforementioned company's product designed to convert Real Audio (.rm) formatted files to other formats.[6] On December 4, 2001, the company was to launch the first coordinated effort to sell and deliver music from major record labels over the Internet, part of a broader initiative by the company to develop subscription Internet services aimed at Web users with fast Internet connections.[7] In 2002, a strategic alliance was formed between RealNetworks and Sony Corporation to expand collaboration.[8] In October, 2005, Microsoft agreed to pay RealNetworks $460 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit.[9]
In August 2003, RealNetworks acquired Listen.com's Rhapsody music service, and renamed it RealRhapsody. It offered streaming music downloads for a monthly fee. In January 2004, RealNetworks announced the RealPlayer Music Store, featuring digital rights management (DRM) restricted music in the AAC file format. After some initial tries to push their own DRM scheme (named Helix DRM) onto all device manufacturers with the Creative Zen Xtra and the Sansa e200r as the only existing compliant devices, they sparked controversy by introducing a technology called Harmony that allowed their music to play on iPods as well as Microsoft Windows Media Audio DRM-equipped devices using a "wrapper" that would convert Helix DRM into the two other target DRM schemes.[citation needed]
The domain real.com attracted at least 67 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com study.[10]
On April 6, 2010, Rhapsody was spun off from RealNetworks.[citation needed]
In July 2013, RealNetworks acquired Slingo for $15.6 million.[11] The company introduced a mobile phone app called Listen in April 2014 that plays custom ringtones to those calling the user's phone.[12]
Headquarters[edit]




RealNetworks headquarters


RealNetworks has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington in the Home Plate Center building in SoDo across from Safeco Field, sharing the building with King5 and Logic 20/20 Consulting.[13][14]
Products and services[edit]
Subscription services[edit]
In 2000, one of the initial products, the download manager RealDownload, was already used for pushing small software, such as games, to subscribers' computers. On top of the subscription for RealDownload and using its RealVideo streaming technology, a service called GoldPass, including unlimited access for video snippets from ABC and movie previews, was offered to registered users for a monthly $10 fee.[15] More content was added through deals with CBS for the reality show Big Brother and NBA basketball.[citation needed]
After the dot-com bubble, RealNetworks cut most of the resources. Some of the content was lost, some was limited to local markets, e.g., Ministry of Sound was available only to UK subscribers. With the increase in broadband usage, RealNetworks started offering live broadcasts of CNN International, BBC World, Al-Jazeera etc., separately for prices between $6 and $12, or bundled in the SuperPass for about $35 a month depending on the market. Between 2003 and 2006, SuperPass included, for European subscribers, unlimited access to UEFA Champions League full-length game recordings.[citation needed]
RealDVD[edit]
On September 30, 2008, RealNetworks launched a new product called RealDVD. The software allows any user to save a copy of a DVD movie they own. The company was later found to have violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and RealNetworks' contract with the DVD Copy Control Association, as the software also allowed anyone to save a movie they do not legally own. (See RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Ass'n, Inc.).[16] The product's distribution was barred by a court injunction.[17][18]
Real Alternative[edit]
Real Alternative is a discontinued software bundle that allows users to play RealMedia files without installing RealPlayer.[19][20] The last version, 2.02, was released on February 19, 2010. It included Media Player Classic.[21][22]
Beginning in 2010, RealNetworks sued Hilbrand Edskes, a 26-year-old Dutch webmaster for having inserted hyperlinks to Real Alternative on his site www.codecpack.nl. RealNetworks alleges that Real Alternative is a reverse engineered package.[23] Meanwhile, Download.com[20] and FileHippo[19] continue to host the software product, unchallenged.[24]
In November 2011 RealNetworks' case against Edskes was dismissed and RealNetworks was ordered to pay him €48,000 in damages.[25][26] Details of the case and judgement have been published.[27]
RealTimes (formerly RealPlayer Cloud)[edit]
RealNetworks in September 2013 launched RealPlayer Cloud, a service that adds the ability to share videos recorded on smartphones and tablets. RealPlayer Cloud ties into the existing RealPlayer, however it also has a Web app and apps for Android, iOS and Roku. The service has 2GB of free cloud storage and more storage for a monthly fee.[28] It was renamed to RealTimes in May 2015, with a new focus on creating and sharing "Stories"—video collages of users' personal photos and videos, set to background music.[29]
Helix[edit]
Main article: Helix (multimedia project)
Helix is a suite of streaming media software and services intended for digital TV set-top boxes, mobile devices, as well as QuickTime, Flash and other programs.[30][31][32] It includes the Helix open-source code and the Helix Universal Server, which hosts, distributes and manages digital rights for multimedia content.[32] Helix competes with the Windows Media 9 Series from Microsoft, but has a greater emphasis on open-source.[31][32] Helix was announced in July 2002.[31] Support for mobile devices was added in November 2005.[33] It was discontinued in October 2014.[34]
GameHouse[edit]
Main article: GameHouse
RealNetworks entered the gaming market in October 2001 with RealArcade, a PC game distribution application that allows users to play casual video games for free for 60 minutes, then decide if they want to purchase it.[35][36] Many of the games were developed by GameHouse, which RealNetworks acquired for $35.6 million in 2004.[37] In 2010, RealNetworks re-launched its gaming division under the name Gamehouse.[38] It began focusing on social games, such as Facebook apps,[39] and in 2013 acquired casual casino games company, Slingo, for $15.6 million.[40]

RealNetworks Hires Mike Mulica To Be President Of Worldwide Sales And Business Development; Appoints Max Pellegrini To New Role As President Of Products And Marketing


SEATTLE, June 10, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- RealNetworks, Inc. (NASDAQ: RNWK) today announced that highly regarded mobile industry executive Mike Mulica, former CEO of Openwave, has joined the company as President of Worldwide Sales and Business Development. In this new role, Mulica will oversee sales, business development, and partnerships at Real.   
"Mike is a world-class executive who has built and run major mobile internet businesses at a series of leading globally focused public and venture-backed companies," said Rob Glaser, Founder and Interim CEO at RealNetworks. "Mike's depth in the mobile business ecosystem is unsurpassed in the industry, and I'm sure he will have a very significant impact as we take Real's turnaround into its next phase."    
"I'm thrilled to join RealNetworks in the midst of a rapidly evolving and forward-thinking time for both the company and the mobile industry," said Mulica. "RealNetworks has heavily invested in compelling consumer and carrier-focused mobile products and services, laying the groundwork to establish the company as an important innovation platform globally." 
In the context of Mike joining the company, RealNetworks will be bringing together its two largest divisions, Mobile Entertainment and the RealPlayer® Group, under a common management team. Max Pellegrini, currently President of RealNetworks' Mobile Entertainment division, will move into a new role as President of Products and Marketing at RealNetworks, focused on the combined mobile entertainment and RealPlayer product lines.   
"In 2013, we revitalized Real's product line with innovative products such as RealPlayer Cloud and LISTEN™," Glaser continued. "As we move into our next phase of our turnaround, there are great opportunities for marketing, sales, and business leverage across all of our Mobile Entertainment and Cloud Products. Teaming up Max and Mike in this new structure sets us up to take the best advantage of this leverage."
Both Pellegrini and Mulica will report directly to Glaser. These organizational and leadership changes do not impact the rest of Real's organizational structure or senior leadership team, or how Real plans to report its 2014 financial results.  
In the first quarter of 2014, RealNetworks continued the global rollout out of RealPlayer Cloud, a platform-agnostic cloud service for consumers that allows its more than 2 million users to store their videos, and play them on and share them to any device. Additionally, RealNetworks' Mobile Entertainment division launched LISTEN™ in the U.S. for T-Mobile subscribers, the first direct-to-consumer RingBack Tone (RBT) app. 
About RealNetworks, Inc.RealNetworks creates innovative products and services that make it easy for people to connect with and enjoy digital media. RealNetworks invented the streaming media category and continues to connect consumers with their digital media both directly and through partners, aiming to support every network, device, media type, and social network.

                    Rival Calls Microsoft Unready To Carry Out European Order                
Microsoft is failing to comply with a European Commission order to sell an unbundled version of its Windows operating system, competitors that were asked to examine the program said on Tuesday. A year ago, Mario Monti, then the European commissioner for competition, ordered Microsoft to sell a second version of Windows in Europe that has its music and video-playing program, Media Player, stripped out.











                    Technology Briefing | Software: RealNetworks Loss Narrows On Higher Sales                
RealNetworks, which sells Internet media software and songs on the Web, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter loss narrowed to $972,000 as sales rose. The net loss equaled a penny a share and compared with a loss of $5.33 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier, the company, based in Seattle, said. Sales rose 34 percent, to $72.5 million, from $54.1 million, exceeding the $68.8 million average estimate of nine analysts polled by Thomson First Call. RealNetworks is selling more songs, games and subscriptions to watch music and video as it moves from selling software to selling content. Music sales almost tripled in the quarter, reaching 30 percent of total revenue. The company expects sales of $73 million to $74.5 million this quarter and a net loss of 1 cent to 2 cents a share, including the costs of an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. .

                    RealNetworks Plans to Sell Songs to Be Played on IPod                
RealNetworks Inc., the maker of media-playing software, has grown tired of waiting for Apple Computer Inc. to share. Tomorrow, without Apple's authorization, RealNetworks will start to give away software that will allow people to buy and download songs from its online music store and then play them on Apple's popular iPod portable devices in addition to those that use the Windows Media Player format and RealNetworks' Helix format.

                    One Small Step In Uphill Fight As Linux Adds A Media Player                
GNU Linux, the free computer operating system, has had far more success in winning converts in corporate data centers than on desktop personal computers. But as more user-friendly software makes its way onto the Linux desktop, the free operating system is starting to make progress in its David-vs.-Goliath competition against Microsoft, the dominant power in PC software. Another step in the progress of Linux in personal computers will come today, when two large Linux distributors, Red Hat and Novell, are expected to announce that they will ship the media-playing software of RealNetworks in their Linux desktop products.











                    Selling 'Nemo' Online, Trying to Repel Pirates                
RealNetworks and the Starz Encore Group will introduce an online service today that will let high-speed Internet users download and watch many of the movies shown on the Starz cable channel. The move is another early attempt by Hollywood to build a business out of downloadable movies and head off the sort of piracy that has hurt the music industry. The new service, called Starz Ticket on Real Movies, will cost $12.95 a month, and subscribers will be able to download and watch 100 or more movies each month, using Real's media player software.

I'm talking about copyright infringement, an international pastime enjoyed by millions thanks to file-trading services like Kazaa.















                    RealNetworks Says Windows Works Without Media Player                
RealNetworks Inc., one of the participants in an antitrust hearing last week concerning the Microsoft Corporation, disproved claims by Microsoft that its Windows operating system depended on the inclusion of its Media Player. In a demonstration before European competition regulators on Friday, RealNetworks, maker of a music- and video-playing computer program called Real One, showed how a little-known version of Windows -- Windows XP Embedded, which is licensed only for industrial use -- can work without Microsoft Media Player attached, three people at the closed-door hearing said.

The agreement would enable many of Vodafone's subsidiaries and partners in 36 countries to use the Real Media Player as well as RealNetworks's Helix Universal Mobile Server software to deliver audio and video to some of the company's 119.7 million cellular subscribers.











                    Technology Briefing | Software: RealNetworks And Ericsson Create Alliance                
RealNetworks Inc., a maker of software that plays Internet audio and video, said yesterday that it would sell software to Ericsson to help cellphone users connect to the Internet. RealNetworks' Helix software system will be installed on Ericsson equipment that is used to connect calls and that is sold to wireless phone providers, said Ian Freed, RealNetworks' vice president for mobile products and services. Content like news, movie previews and the audio of baseball games will soon be widely available on cellphones connected to the Internet, Mr. Freed said. About 300 million personal computers are linked to the Internet. The number of connected devices, including cellphones, will rise to about one billion in a few years, he said. Shares of RealNetworks rose 20 cents, to $4.07.

                    Baseball Test May Soon Show If Time Is Right For Web Video                
The discussion about the Super Bowl has hardly died down, and baseball's spring training is still a month away. But Major League Baseball and RealNetworks are already preparing to use this year's baseball season to test whether Internet broadcasting is more than just a minor league sport. Last year, 200,000 people paid $14.95 to listen to online radio broadcasts of every baseball game and watch video of game highlights, making baseball the most popular paid Webcasting service. This year, baseball will become the first major league sport to broadcast live video feeds online for a major portion of its games.











                    Technology Briefing | Internet: RealNetworks Names Executive                
Merrill Brown, the former senior vice president and editor in chief of Msnbc.com, the online joint venture of Microsoft and NBC News, is joining RealNetworks Inc., as a senior vice president in charge of broadening subscription and advertising sales efforts. RealNetworks markets software to enable transmission and reception of audio and video files over the Internet. RealOne Services, the unit he will oversee, offers subscription services for online game players -- RealOne GamePass -- and its RealOne SuperPass gives subscribers access to extended information about everything from the CBS reality series ''Big Brother 3'' to the world of Nascar racing. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Brown said that ''if it's a good time for anything online, it may well be a very good time'' for ''figuring out the revenue game, figuring out how to make sense out of the content mess we're in.'' He added, ''It's largely going to be about developing new subscription strategies.'' Felicity Barringer (NYT)











                    States Question Microsoft Motive In Move to Add Media Players                
The Microsoft Corporation bundled new-media player features into Windows to counter a ''strategic threat'' from RealNetworks Inc., according to documents produced by nine states seeking antitrust remedies against Microsoft. The states, which are challenging a proposed settlement of the federal government's four-year-old antitrust case against Microsoft, are trying to persuade a federal judge to impose more restraints on Microsoft's ability to use its Windows operating system to crush competitors.











                    World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Sony Raises Web Exposure                
Looking to increase its links to the Internet, the Sony Corporation said that it would buy 1 percent of RealNetworks Inc., a provider of online digital video technology. Sony, the world's largest electronics company, is looking for additional ways to sell the game software, music and movies it produces. Sony hopes to make its popular PlayStation 2 game console a one-stop vehicle for downloading entertainment in the home. Sony, which will pay an estimated $11 million for the stake, will also work with RealNetworks to develop software and ways to distribute digital media using Sony products. Ken Belson (NYT)

                    REALNETWORKS PLANS TO LET WORKERS SWAP OPTIONS                
RealNetworks, a software maker whose shares have fallen 89 percent the last year, said yesterday that employees would be allowed to exchange existing stock options for new ones because many were trading below the strike price. The new strike price will be based on the share value at the end of August, said Erika Shaffer, a spokeswoman for RealNetworks. Employees could lose if shares rose above the strike price of current options by the end of August and gain if the shares continued to trade at lower levels. The exchange will not require RealNetworks to take a charge against earnings. RealNetworks, which makes software to play audio and video files from the Internet, said employees held about 24 million options with an exercise price above $10. RealNetworks shares fell 50 cents to $8.94.

                    Technology Briefing | Software: RealNetworks Loss Narrows On Higher Sales                
RealNetworks, which sells Internet media software and songs on the Web, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter loss narrowed to $972,000 as sales rose. The net loss equaled a penny a share and compared with a loss of $5.33 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier, the company, based in Seattle, said. Sales rose 34 percent, to $72.5 million, from $54.1 million, exceeding the $68.8 million average estimate of nine analysts polled by Thomson First Call. RealNetworks is selling more songs, games and subscriptions to watch music and video as it moves from selling software to selling content. Music sales almost tripled in the quarter, reaching 30 percent of total revenue. The company expects sales of $73 million to $74.5 million this quarter and a net loss of 1 cent to 2 cents a share, including the costs of an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft. .

                    One Small Step In Uphill Fight As Linux Adds A Media Player                
GNU Linux, the free computer operating system, has had far more success in winning converts in corporate data centers than on desktop personal computers. But as more user-friendly software makes its way onto the Linux desktop, the free operating system is starting to make progress in its David-vs.-Goliath competition against Microsoft, the dominant power in PC software. Another step in the progress of Linux in personal computers will come today, when two large Linux distributors, Red Hat and Novell, are expected to announce that they will ship the media-playing software of RealNetworks in their Linux desktop products.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Anti-circumvention, Copyright


RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Association, Inc., 641 F. Supp. 2d 913 (2009), is a United States District Court case involving RealNetworks, the movie studios and DVD Copy Control Association regarding the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claims on the manufacturing and distribution of RealDVD, and a breach of license agreement. The district court concluded that RealNetworks violated the anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA when the DVD copying software RealDVD bypasses the copy protection technologies of DVD.
This lawsuit is one of the many legal actions taken by the movie studios in an attempt to restrict the copying of DVDs.

Background[edit]
This case involves the digital media company RealNetworks, DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA) and the major motion picture studios. RealNetworks licensed the Content Scramble System (CSS), a technology commonly used on copyrighted DVDs to prevent unauthorized copying, from DVD CCA and released the product RealDVD that allows users to make hard drive copies of copyrighted DVDs.[1] However, some major movie studios feel that RealDVD can threaten the emerging market in digital downloads and encourage people to make copies of rental DVDs instead of purchasing.[2][3] RealNetworks, on the other hand, believes that copying of DVD is now legal after the favorable ruling of a 2007 California Superior Court case against Kaleidescape, a manufacturer of high-end media servers capable of copying copyrighted DVD content to the servers.[1][4] Therefore, RealNetworks sued the DVD CCA and several major movie studios on September 30, 2008 seeking for a declaratory judgment that RealDVD neither violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) 17 U.S.C. § 1201 nor breached the licensing contract with DVD CCA. On the same day, the studios sued RealNetworks by alleging that RealNetworks violated the DMCA and breached the contract.[1]
District court ruling[edit]
The district court issued a temporary restraining order on October 3, 2008 after the initial hearing of the case to prevent the sale and distribution of RealDVD. The temporary restraining order was turned into a preliminary injunction against RealNetworks on August 11, 2009 by Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, barring the manufacturing and distribution of RealDVD or any other similar software product after the court found that RealNetworks violated the DMCA and breached the CSS licensing agreement with DVD CCA.[1][5][6]
DMCA claims on Content Scramble System[edit]
The DMCA prohibits circumvention of "effective" access control of copyrighted works and the trafficking of tools that are designed primarily to circumvent "effective" access control or copy control of copyrighted works.[7] RealNetworks alleged that that CSS is not effective anymore because it has been cracked or hacked.[8][9] However, the court ruled that the DMCA statute does not require the access control or copy control technology to be strong as long as it prevents unauthorized access and/or copying under ordinary course of operation and with the authority of the copyright owner. Since the court concluded that CSS is still effective for ordinary uses, the DMCA claim against RealNetworks is valid.[1][6]
The court decided that RealDVD is primarily designed or produced to circumvent CSS technology. In particular, the court found that the removal of crucial CSS technology in DVD drive-locking, secure storage of content keys on DVD, CSS authentication and CSS bus encryption during the playback of copied DVD content from the hard dive is a circumvention of CSS, even though they are not needed when playback from the hard drive.[6] The court further explained that even though RealNetworks is a licensee of CSS technology, it does not shield RealNetworks from DMCA claim because the removal of CSS technology is a violation of DMCA.[1]
DMCA claims on Sony ARccOS and Macrovision RipGuard[edit]
RealDVD also circumvented copy control measure in Sony ARccOS Protection and Macrovision RipGuard, which are designed not to impair normal playback but to prevent copying by inserting intentional bad sectors and fake menu structures to the DVDs, by mimicking the way human watches a DVD or by skipping the unreadable data.[1][6] RealNetworks contended that Sony ARccOS and Macrovision RipGuard are not effective copy control measure because they only prolong the copying process. The district court rejected this argument because ARccOS and RipGuard may make copying take so long that copying is essentially not viable. RealNetworks then argued that ARccOS and RipGuard are never encountered during normal playback, leaving a back door to copying wide open, thus, they are not effective copy control measures. But the court disagreed with this argument because if this is the law, then "effective" copy protection measure will have to prevent against every possible current and future means of copying. Finally, RealNetworks asserted that regular DVD players can make temporary copies as cache, so ARccOS and RipGuard do not prevent copying. However, the court deemed this argument flawed by distinguishing that cache copies are byproduct of playback, but copies made by RealDVD are permanent.[1]
RealNetworks accused of evidence destruction[edit]
Before the March 16, 2009 hearing the DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. wrote to U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel that RealNetworks had destroyed critical pieces of evidence and that this had irrevocably damaged the integrity of the judicial process. The claim was that RealNetworks knew from the start that what they were producing had a high likelihood of resulting in legal action so the company took measures to cover its tracks along the way. The documentation of this released to the public was heavily redacted, however it indicated that RealNetworks intentionally eliminated engineering notebooks, code files, and documents that pointed to the fact that the RealDVD software was mainly produced by hackers.[10][11]
Breach of license agreement[edit]
RealNetworks argued that it fully complied with the CSS license agreement not only by preserving all of the associated protection but also by adding Advanced Encryption System (AES) encryption to the copied content so that only the person who made the copy can play back the copied content with RealNetworks' player. However, the court decided that preserving the CSS protection only once during the initial playback of the DVD is not enough and any subsequent absence of CSS technology during the playback of copied DVD content from the hard drive is a contract violation.[1]
Antitrust claims[edit]
On May 14, 2009, RealNetworks amended the lawsuit to include antitrust claims against DVD CCA and the major studios, alleging that the delayed product launch of RealDVD, temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction are the results of DVD CCA and the movie studios conspiring to deny the licensing of CSS to make hard drive copies of DVD content.[5][12] However, the court dismissed the claim because consumer can get the same hard drive copies through digital downloads, and some DVDs even come with an additional, non-CSS encrypted DVD that allows the users to copy the content onto the hard drive. Also, even if RealNetworks is able to obtain a license to circumvent CSS, RealNetworks still violated the DMCA for circumventing ARccOS and RipGuard.[12]
Subsequent development[edit]
In November 2009, RealNetworks filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking to remove the injunction on the sales of RealDVD. RealNetworks claimed that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in granting a request by the major studios to halt sales of the software and was wrong to presume RealDVD would cause the film industry irreparable harm.[13] In March 2010, RealNetworks and DVD CCA reached a settlement in which RealNetworks agreed to the injunction against selling the RealDVD software and a payment of $4.5 million in legal cost to the studios. It would also refund the payments from the approximately 2,700 current users of RealDVD.[14]
Despite the defeat of DVD-copying tools in this and other court cases, many similar software, such as HandBrake which by itself only works with unprotected digital media,[15] continue to be free and widespread on the internet. Some believe that this indicates the ineffectiveness of the major studios' effort to restrict the copying of DVDs through legal rulings.[3][16]
Related cases[edit]

Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes is one of the first cases that tested the DMCA in dealing with the legality of unlicensed CSS decryption software. In this case, the movie studios sought for an injunction against the distribution of DeCSS, a program made to allow the copying of DVD content onto the hard drive.[17]
MGM Studios, Inc. v. 321 Studios is another early DMCA case trying to determine the legitimacy of software that allows the users to make copies of DVDs. In this case, 321 Studios stressed that such a software is legal because it allows users to make fair use copies of DVD content.[18]
DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. v. Kaleidescape, Inc. is a closely related case in the sense that both Kaleidescape's and RealNetworks' systems are meant to allow the users to better organize their media content through DVD copies on the hard drive. But unlike the RealNetworks case, the Kaleidescape case addresses only the breach of CSS license agreement.[4]

Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Anti-circumvention, Copyright


RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Association, Inc., 641 F. Supp. 2d 913 (2009), is a United States District Court case involving RealNetworks, the movie studios and DVD Copy Control Association regarding the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claims on the manufacturing and distribution of RealDVD, and a breach of license agreement. The district court concluded that RealNetworks violated the anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA when the DVD copying software RealDVD bypasses the copy protection technologies of DVD.
This lawsuit is one of the many legal actions taken by the movie studios in an attempt to restrict the copying of DVDs.

Background[edit]
This case involves the digital media company RealNetworks, DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA) and the major motion picture studios. RealNetworks licensed the Content Scramble System (CSS), a technology commonly used on copyrighted DVDs to prevent unauthorized copying, from DVD CCA and released the product RealDVD that allows users to make hard drive copies of copyrighted DVDs.[1] However, some major movie studios feel that RealDVD can threaten the emerging market in digital downloads and encourage people to make copies of rental DVDs instead of purchasing.[2][3] RealNetworks, on the other hand, believes that copying of DVD is now legal after the favorable ruling of a 2007 California Superior Court case against Kaleidescape, a manufacturer of high-end media servers capable of copying copyrighted DVD content to the servers.[1][4] Therefore, RealNetworks sued the DVD CCA and several major movie studios on September 30, 2008 seeking for a declaratory judgment that RealDVD neither violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) 17 U.S.C. § 1201 nor breached the licensing contract with DVD CCA. On the same day, the studios sued RealNetworks by alleging that RealNetworks violated the DMCA and breached the contract.[1]
District court ruling[edit]
The district court issued a temporary restraining order on October 3, 2008 after the initial hearing of the case to prevent the sale and distribution of RealDVD. The temporary restraining order was turned into a preliminary injunction against RealNetworks on August 11, 2009 by Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, barring the manufacturing and distribution of RealDVD or any other similar software product after the court found that RealNetworks violated the DMCA and breached the CSS licensing agreement with DVD CCA.[1][5][6]
DMCA claims on Content Scramble System[edit]
The DMCA prohibits circumvention of "effective" access control of copyrighted works and the trafficking of tools that are designed primarily to circumvent "effective" access control or copy control of copyrighted works.[7] RealNetworks alleged that that CSS is not effective anymore because it has been cracked or hacked.[8][9] However, the court ruled that the DMCA statute does not require the access control or copy control technology to be strong as long as it prevents unauthorized access and/or copying under ordinary course of operation and with the authority of the copyright owner. Since the court concluded that CSS is still effective for ordinary uses, the DMCA claim against RealNetworks is valid.[1][6]
The court decided that RealDVD is primarily designed or produced to circumvent CSS technology. In particular, the court found that the removal of crucial CSS technology in DVD drive-locking, secure storage of content keys on DVD, CSS authentication and CSS bus encryption during the playback of copied DVD content from the hard dive is a circumvention of CSS, even though they are not needed when playback from the hard drive.[6] The court further explained that even though RealNetworks is a licensee of CSS technology, it does not shield RealNetworks from DMCA claim because the removal of CSS technology is a violation of DMCA.[1]
DMCA claims on Sony ARccOS and Macrovision RipGuard[edit]
RealDVD also circumvented copy control measure in Sony ARccOS Protection and Macrovision RipGuard, which are designed not to impair normal playback but to prevent copying by inserting intentional bad sectors and fake menu structures to the DVDs, by mimicking the way human watches a DVD or by skipping the unreadable data.[1][6] RealNetworks contended that Sony ARccOS and Macrovision RipGuard are not effective copy control measure because they only prolong the copying process. The district court rejected this argument because ARccOS and RipGuard may make copying take so long that copying is essentially not viable. RealNetworks then argued that ARccOS and RipGuard are never encountered during normal playback, leaving a back door to copying wide open, thus, they are not effective copy control measures. But the court disagreed with this argument because if this is the law, then "effective" copy protection measure will have to prevent against every possible current and future means of copying. Finally, RealNetworks asserted that regular DVD players can make temporary copies as cache, so ARccOS and RipGuard do not prevent copying. However, the court deemed this argument flawed by distinguishing that cache copies are byproduct of playback, but copies made by RealDVD are permanent.[1]
RealNetworks accused of evidence destruction[edit]
Before the March 16, 2009 hearing the DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. wrote to U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel that RealNetworks had destroyed critical pieces of evidence and that this had irrevocably damaged the integrity of the judicial process. The claim was that RealNetworks knew from the start that what they were producing had a high likelihood of resulting in legal action so the company took measures to cover its tracks along the way. The documentation of this released to the public was heavily redacted, however it indicated that RealNetworks intentionally eliminated engineering notebooks, code files, and documents that pointed to the fact that the RealDVD software was mainly produced by hackers.[10][11]
Breach of license agreement[edit]
RealNetworks argued that it fully complied with the CSS license agreement not only by preserving all of the associated protection but also by adding Advanced Encryption System (AES) encryption to the copied content so that only the person who made the copy can play back the copied content with RealNetworks' player. However, the court decided that preserving the CSS protection only once during the initial playback of the DVD is not enough and any subsequent absence of CSS technology during the playback of copied DVD content from the hard drive is a contract violation.[1]
Antitrust claims[edit]
On May 14, 2009, RealNetworks amended the lawsuit to include antitrust claims against DVD CCA and the major studios, alleging that the delayed product launch of RealDVD, temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction are the results of DVD CCA and the movie studios conspiring to deny the licensing of CSS to make hard drive copies of DVD content.[5][12] However, the court dismissed the claim because consumer can get the same hard drive copies through digital downloads, and some DVDs even come with an additional, non-CSS encrypted DVD that allows the users to copy the content onto the hard drive. Also, even if RealNetworks is able to obtain a license to circumvent CSS, RealNetworks still violated the DMCA for circumventing ARccOS and RipGuard.[12]
Subsequent development[edit]
In November 2009, RealNetworks filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking to remove the injunction on the sales of RealDVD. RealNetworks claimed that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in granting a request by the major studios to halt sales of the software and was wrong to presume RealDVD would cause the film industry irreparable harm.[13] In March 2010, RealNetworks and DVD CCA reached a settlement in which RealNetworks agreed to the injunction against selling the RealDVD software and a payment of $4.5 million in legal cost to the studios. It would also refund the payments from the approximately 2,700 current users of RealDVD.[14]
Despite the defeat of DVD-copying tools in this and other court cases, many similar software, such as HandBrake which by itself only works with unprotected digital media,[15] continue to be free and widespread on the internet. Some believe that this indicates the ineffectiveness of the major studios' effort to restrict the copying of DVDs through legal rulings.[3][16]
Related cases[edit]

Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes is one of the first cases that tested the DMCA in dealing with the legality of unlicensed CSS decryption software. In this case, the movie studios sought for an injunction against the distribution of DeCSS, a program made to allow the copying of DVD content onto the hard drive.[17]
MGM Studios, Inc. v. 321 Studios is another early DMCA case trying to determine the legitimacy of software that allows the users to make copies of DVDs. In this case, 321 Studios stressed that such a software is legal because it allows users to make fair use copies of DVD content.[18]
DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. v. Kaleidescape, Inc. is a closely related case in the sense that both Kaleidescape's and RealNetworks' systems are meant to allow the users to better organize their media content through DVD copies on the hard drive. But unlike the RealNetworks case, the Kaleidescape case addresses only the breach of CSS license agreement.[4]

District court ruling[edit]
The district court issued a temporary restraining order on October 3, 2008 after the initial hearing of the case to prevent the sale and distribution of RealDVD. The temporary restraining order was turned into a preliminary injunction against RealNetworks on August 11, 2009 by Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, barring the manufacturing and distribution of RealDVD or any other similar software product after the court found that RealNetworks violated the DMCA and breached the CSS licensing agreement with DVD CCA.[1][5][6]
DMCA claims on Content Scramble System[edit]
The DMCA prohibits circumvention of "effective" access control of copyrighted works and the trafficking of tools that are designed primarily to circumvent "effective" access control or copy control of copyrighted works.[7] RealNetworks alleged that that CSS is not effective anymore because it has been cracked or hacked.[8][9] However, the court ruled that the DMCA statute does not require the access control or copy control technology to be strong as long as it prevents unauthorized access and/or copying under ordinary course of operation and with the authority of the copyright owner. Since the court concluded that CSS is still effective for ordinary uses, the DMCA claim against RealNetworks is valid.[1][6]
The court decided that RealDVD is primarily designed or produced to circumvent CSS technology. In particular, the court found that the removal of crucial CSS technology in DVD drive-locking, secure storage of content keys on DVD, CSS authentication and CSS bus encryption during the playback of copied DVD content from the hard dive is a circumvention of CSS, even though they are not needed when playback from the hard drive.[6] The court further explained that even though RealNetworks is a licensee of CSS technology, it does not shield RealNetworks from DMCA claim because the removal of CSS technology is a violation of DMCA.[1]
DMCA claims on Sony ARccOS and Macrovision RipGuard[edit]
RealDVD also circumvented copy control measure in Sony ARccOS Protection and Macrovision RipGuard, which are designed not to impair normal playback but to prevent copying by inserting intentional bad sectors and fake menu structures to the DVDs, by mimicking the way human watches a DVD or by skipping the unreadable data.[1][6] RealNetworks contended that Sony ARccOS and Macrovision RipGuard are not effective copy control measure because they only prolong the copying process. The district court rejected this argument because ARccOS and RipGuard may make copying take so long that copying is essentially not viable. RealNetworks then argued that ARccOS and RipGuard are never encountered during normal playback, leaving a back door to copying wide open, thus, they are not effective copy control measures. But the court disagreed with this argument because if this is the law, then "effective" copy protection measure will have to prevent against every possible current and future means of copying. Finally, RealNetworks asserted that regular DVD players can make temporary copies as cache, so ARccOS and RipGuard do not prevent copying. However, the court deemed this argument flawed by distinguishing that cache copies are byproduct of playback, but copies made by RealDVD are permanent.[1]
RealNetworks accused of evidence destruction[edit]
Before the March 16, 2009 hearing the DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. wrote to U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel that RealNetworks had destroyed critical pieces of evidence and that this had irrevocably damaged the integrity of the judicial process. The claim was that RealNetworks knew from the start that what they were producing had a high likelihood of resulting in legal action so the company took measures to cover its tracks along the way. The documentation of this released to the public was heavily redacted, however it indicated that RealNetworks intentionally eliminated engineering notebooks, code files, and documents that pointed to the fact that the RealDVD software was mainly produced by hackers.[10][11]
Breach of license agreement[edit]
RealNetworks argued that it fully complied with the CSS license agreement not only by preserving all of the associated protection but also by adding Advanced Encryption System (AES) encryption to the copied content so that only the person who made the copy can play back the copied content with RealNetworks' player. However, the court decided that preserving the CSS protection only once during the initial playback of the DVD is not enough and any subsequent absence of CSS technology during the playback of copied DVD content from the hard drive is a contract violation.[1]
Antitrust claims[edit]
On May 14, 2009, RealNetworks amended the lawsuit to include antitrust claims against DVD CCA and the major studios, alleging that the delayed product launch of RealDVD, temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction are the results of DVD CCA and the movie studios conspiring to deny the licensing of CSS to make hard drive copies of DVD content.[5][12] However, the court dismissed the claim because consumer can get the same hard drive copies through digital downloads, and some DVDs even come with an additional, non-CSS encrypted DVD that allows the users to copy the content onto the hard drive. Also, even if RealNetworks is able to obtain a license to circumvent CSS, RealNetworks still violated the DMCA for circumventing ARccOS and RipGuard.[12]
Subsequent development[edit]
In November 2009, RealNetworks filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking to remove the injunction on the sales of RealDVD. RealNetworks claimed that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in granting a request by the major studios to halt sales of the software and was wrong to presume RealDVD would cause the film industry irreparable harm.[13] In March 2010, RealNetworks and DVD CCA reached a settlement in which RealNetworks agreed to the injunction against selling the RealDVD software and a payment of $4.5 million in legal cost to the studios. It would also refund the payments from the approximately 2,700 current users of RealDVD.[14]
Despite the defeat of DVD-copying tools in this and other court cases, many similar software, such as HandBrake which by itself only works with unprotected digital media,[15] continue to be free and widespread on the internet. Some believe that this indicates the ineffectiveness of the major studios' effort to restrict the copying of DVDs through legal rulings.[3][16]
Related cases[edit]

Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes is one of the first cases that tested the DMCA in dealing with the legality of unlicensed CSS decryption software. In this case, the movie studios sought for an injunction against the distribution of DeCSS, a program made to allow the copying of DVD content onto the hard drive.[17]
MGM Studios, Inc. v. 321 Studios is another early DMCA case trying to determine the legitimacy of software that allows the users to make copies of DVDs. In this case, 321 Studios stressed that such a software is legal because it allows users to make fair use copies of DVD content.[18]
DVD Copy Control Association, Inc. v. Kaleidescape, Inc. is a closely related case in the sense that both Kaleidescape's and RealNetworks' systems are meant to allow the users to better organize their media content through DVD copies on the hard drive. But unlike the RealNetworks case, the Kaleidescape case addresses only the breach of CSS license agreement.[4]

Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Anti-circumvention, Copyright


RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Association, Inc., 641 F. Supp. 2d 913 (2009), is a United States District Court case involving RealNetworks, the movie studios and DVD Copy Control Association regarding the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claims on the manufacturing and distribution of RealDVD, and a breach of license agreement. The district court concluded that RealNetworks violated the anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking provisions of the DMCA when the DVD copying software RealDVD bypasses the copy protection technologies of DVD.
This lawsuit is one of the many legal actions taken by the movie studios in an attempt to restrict the copying of DVDs.

Background[edit]
This case involves the digital media company RealNetworks, DVD Copy Control Association (DVD CCA) and the major motion picture studios. RealNetworks licensed the Content Scramble System (CSS), a technology commonly used on copyrighted DVDs to prevent unauthorized copying, from DVD CCA and released the product RealDVD that allows users to make hard drive copies of copyrighted DVDs.[1] However, some major movie studios feel that RealDVD can threaten the emerging market in digital downloads and encourage people to make copies of rental DVDs instead of purchasing.[2][3] RealNetworks, on the other hand, believes that copying of DVD is now legal after the favorable ruling of a 2007 California Superior Court case against Kaleidescape, a manufacturer of high-end media servers capable of copying copyrighted DVD content to the servers.[1][4] Therefore, RealNetworks sued the DVD CCA and several major movie studios on September 30, 2008 seeking for a declaratory judgment that RealDVD neither violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) 17 U.S.C. § 1201 nor breached the licensing contract with DVD CCA. On the same day, the studios sued RealNetworks by alleging that RealNetworks violated the DMCA and breached the contract.[1]
District court ruling[edit]
The district court issued a temporary restraining order on October 3, 2008 after the initial hearing of the case to prevent the sale and distribution of RealDVD. The temporary restraining order was turned into a preliminary injunction against RealNetworks on August 11, 2009 by Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, barring the manufacturing and distribution of RealDVD or any other similar software product after the court found that RealNetworks violated the DMCA and breached the CSS licensing agreement with DVD CCA.[1][5][6]

History[edit]
RealNetworks (then known as Progressive Networks) was founded in 1994 by an ex-Microsoft executive, Rob Glaser and a management team including Phil Barrett, Andy Sharpless, and Stephen Buerkle. The original goal of the company was to provide a distribution channel for politically progressive content. It evolved into a technology venture to leverage the Internet as an alternative distribution medium for audio broadcasts. Progressive Networks became RealNetworks in September 1997.
RealNetworks are pioneers in the streaming media markets and broadcast one of the earlier audio events over the Internet — a baseball game between the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners — on September 5, 1995. They announced streaming video technology in 1997. According to some accounts,[which?] by 2000, more than 85% of streaming content on the Internet was in the Real format.[4]
Despite this success, problems arose because Real's primary business model depended upon the sale of streaming media server software, and Microsoft and Apple were giving those products away. As servers from Microsoft and Apple became more capable, Real's server sales inevitably eroded.[5]
On January 20, 2000, RealNetworks, Inc. filed an injunction against Streambox, Inc. regarding the aforementioned company's product designed to convert Real Audio (.rm) formatted files to other formats.[6] On December 4, 2001, the company was to launch the first coordinated effort to sell and deliver music from major record labels over the Internet, part of a broader initiative by the company to develop subscription Internet services aimed at Web users with fast Internet connections.[7] In 2002, a strategic alliance was formed between RealNetworks and Sony Corporation to expand collaboration.[8] In October, 2005, Microsoft agreed to pay RealNetworks $460 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit.[9]
In August 2003, RealNetworks acquired Listen.com's Rhapsody music service, and renamed it RealRhapsody. It offered streaming music downloads for a monthly fee. In January 2004, RealNetworks announced the RealPlayer Music Store, featuring digital rights management (DRM) restricted music in the AAC file format. After some initial tries to push their own DRM scheme (named Helix DRM) onto all device manufacturers with the Creative Zen Xtra and the Sansa e200r as the only existing compliant devices, they sparked controversy by introducing a technology called Harmony that allowed their music to play on iPods as well as Microsoft Windows Media Audio DRM-equipped devices using a "wrapper" that would convert Helix DRM into the two other target DRM schemes.[citation needed]
The domain real.com attracted at least 67 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com study.[10]
On April 6, 2010, Rhapsody was spun off from RealNetworks.[citation needed]
In July 2013, RealNetworks acquired Slingo for $15.6 million.[11] The company introduced a mobile phone app called Listen in April 2014 that plays custom ringtones to those calling the user's phone.[12]
Headquarters[edit]




RealNetworks headquarters


RealNetworks has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington in the Home Plate Center building in SoDo across from Safeco Field, sharing the building with King5 and Logic 20/20 Consulting.[13][14]
Products and services[edit]
Subscription services[edit]
In 2000, one of the initial products, the download manager RealDownload, was already used for pushing small software, such as games, to subscribers' computers. On top of the subscription for RealDownload and using its RealVideo streaming technology, a service called GoldPass, including unlimited access for video snippets from ABC and movie previews, was offered to registered users for a monthly $10 fee.[15] More content was added through deals with CBS for the reality show Big Brother and NBA basketball.[citation needed]
After the dot-com bubble, RealNetworks cut most of the resources. Some of the content was lost, some was limited to local markets, e.g., Ministry of Sound was available only to UK subscribers. With the increase in broadband usage, RealNetworks started offering live broadcasts of CNN International, BBC World, Al-Jazeera etc., separately for prices between $6 and $12, or bundled in the SuperPass for about $35 a month depending on the market. Between 2003 and 2006, SuperPass included, for European subscribers, unlimited access to UEFA Champions League full-length game recordings.[citation needed]
RealDVD[edit]
On September 30, 2008, RealNetworks launched a new product called RealDVD. The software allows any user to save a copy of a DVD movie they own. The company was later found to have violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and RealNetworks' contract with the DVD Copy Control Association, as the software also allowed anyone to save a movie they do not legally own. (See RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Ass'n, Inc.).[16] The product's distribution was barred by a court injunction.[17][18]
Real Alternative[edit]
Real Alternative is a discontinued software bundle that allows users to play RealMedia files without installing RealPlayer.[19][20] The last version, 2.02, was released on February 19, 2010. It included Media Player Classic.[21][22]
Beginning in 2010, RealNetworks sued Hilbrand Edskes, a 26-year-old Dutch webmaster for having inserted hyperlinks to Real Alternative on his site www.codecpack.nl. RealNetworks alleges that Real Alternative is a reverse engineered package.[23] Meanwhile, Download.com[20] and FileHippo[19] continue to host the software product, unchallenged.[24]
In November 2011 RealNetworks' case against Edskes was dismissed and RealNetworks was ordered to pay him €48,000 in damages.[25][26] Details of the case and judgement have been published.[27]
RealTimes (formerly RealPlayer Cloud)[edit]
RealNetworks in September 2013 launched RealPlayer Cloud, a service that adds the ability to share videos recorded on smartphones and tablets. RealPlayer Cloud ties into the existing RealPlayer, however it also has a Web app and apps for Android, iOS and Roku. The service has 2GB of free cloud storage and more storage for a monthly fee.[28] It was renamed to RealTimes in May 2015, with a new focus on creating and sharing "Stories"—video collages of users' personal photos and videos, set to background music.[29]
Helix[edit]
Main article: Helix (multimedia project)
Helix is a suite of streaming media software and services intended for digital TV set-top boxes, mobile devices, as well as QuickTime, Flash and other programs.[30][31][32] It includes the Helix open-source code and the Helix Universal Server, which hosts, distributes and manages digital rights for multimedia content.[32] Helix competes with the Windows Media 9 Series from Microsoft, but has a greater emphasis on open-source.[31][32] Helix was announced in July 2002.[31] Support for mobile devices was added in November 2005.[33] It was discontinued in October 2014.[34]
GameHouse[edit]
Main article: GameHouse
RealNetworks entered the gaming market in October 2001 with RealArcade, a PC game distribution application that allows users to play casual video games for free for 60 minutes, then decide if they want to purchase it.[35][36] Many of the games were developed by GameHouse, which RealNetworks acquired for $35.6 million in 2004.[37] In 2010, RealNetworks re-launched its gaming division under the name Gamehouse.[38] It began focusing on social games, such as Facebook apps,[39] and in 2013 acquired casual casino games company, Slingo, for $15.6 million.[40]

History[edit]
RealNetworks (then known as Progressive Networks) was founded in 1994 by an ex-Microsoft executive, Rob Glaser and a management team including Phil Barrett, Andy Sharpless, and Stephen Buerkle. The original goal of the company was to provide a distribution channel for politically progressive content. It evolved into a technology venture to leverage the Internet as an alternative distribution medium for audio broadcasts. Progressive Networks became RealNetworks in September 1997.
RealNetworks are pioneers in the streaming media markets and broadcast one of the earlier audio events over the Internet — a baseball game between the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners — on September 5, 1995. They announced streaming video technology in 1997. According to some accounts,[which?] by 2000, more than 85% of streaming content on the Internet was in the Real format.[4]
Despite this success, problems arose because Real's primary business model depended upon the sale of streaming media server software, and Microsoft and Apple were giving those products away. As servers from Microsoft and Apple became more capable, Real's server sales inevitably eroded.[5]
On January 20, 2000, RealNetworks, Inc. filed an injunction against Streambox, Inc. regarding the aforementioned company's product designed to convert Real Audio (.rm) formatted files to other formats.[6] On December 4, 2001, the company was to launch the first coordinated effort to sell and deliver music from major record labels over the Internet, part of a broader initiative by the company to develop subscription Internet services aimed at Web users with fast Internet connections.[7] In 2002, a strategic alliance was formed between RealNetworks and Sony Corporation to expand collaboration.[8] In October, 2005, Microsoft agreed to pay RealNetworks $460 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit.[9]
In August 2003, RealNetworks acquired Listen.com's Rhapsody music service, and renamed it RealRhapsody. It offered streaming music downloads for a monthly fee. In January 2004, RealNetworks announced the RealPlayer Music Store, featuring digital rights management (DRM) restricted music in the AAC file format. After some initial tries to push their own DRM scheme (named Helix DRM) onto all device manufacturers with the Creative Zen Xtra and the Sansa e200r as the only existing compliant devices, they sparked controversy by introducing a technology called Harmony that allowed their music to play on iPods as well as Microsoft Windows Media Audio DRM-equipped devices using a "wrapper" that would convert Helix DRM into the two other target DRM schemes.[citation needed]
The domain real.com attracted at least 67 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com study.[10]
On April 6, 2010, Rhapsody was spun off from RealNetworks.[citation needed]
In July 2013, RealNetworks acquired Slingo for $15.6 million.[11] The company introduced a mobile phone app called Listen in April 2014 that plays custom ringtones to those calling the user's phone.[12]
Headquarters[edit]




RealNetworks headquarters


RealNetworks has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington in the Home Plate Center building in SoDo across from Safeco Field, sharing the building with King5 and Logic 20/20 Consulting.[13][14]
Products and services[edit]
Subscription services[edit]
In 2000, one of the initial products, the download manager RealDownload, was already used for pushing small software, such as games, to subscribers' computers. On top of the subscription for RealDownload and using its RealVideo streaming technology, a service called GoldPass, including unlimited access for video snippets from ABC and movie previews, was offered to registered users for a monthly $10 fee.[15] More content was added through deals with CBS for the reality show Big Brother and NBA basketball.[citation needed]
After the dot-com bubble, RealNetworks cut most of the resources. Some of the content was lost, some was limited to local markets, e.g., Ministry of Sound was available only to UK subscribers. With the increase in broadband usage, RealNetworks started offering live broadcasts of CNN International, BBC World, Al-Jazeera etc., separately for prices between $6 and $12, or bundled in the SuperPass for about $35 a month depending on the market. Between 2003 and 2006, SuperPass included, for European subscribers, unlimited access to UEFA Champions League full-length game recordings.[citation needed]
RealDVD[edit]
On September 30, 2008, RealNetworks launched a new product called RealDVD. The software allows any user to save a copy of a DVD movie they own. The company was later found to have violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and RealNetworks' contract with the DVD Copy Control Association, as the software also allowed anyone to save a movie they do not legally own. (See RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Ass'n, Inc.).[16] The product's distribution was barred by a court injunction.[17][18]
Real Alternative[edit]
Real Alternative is a discontinued software bundle that allows users to play RealMedia files without installing RealPlayer.[19][20] The last version, 2.02, was released on February 19, 2010. It included Media Player Classic.[21][22]
Beginning in 2010, RealNetworks sued Hilbrand Edskes, a 26-year-old Dutch webmaster for having inserted hyperlinks to Real Alternative on his site www.codecpack.nl. RealNetworks alleges that Real Alternative is a reverse engineered package.[23] Meanwhile, Download.com[20] and FileHippo[19] continue to host the software product, unchallenged.[24]
In November 2011 RealNetworks' case against Edskes was dismissed and RealNetworks was ordered to pay him €48,000 in damages.[25][26] Details of the case and judgement have been published.[27]
RealTimes (formerly RealPlayer Cloud)[edit]
RealNetworks in September 2013 launched RealPlayer Cloud, a service that adds the ability to share videos recorded on smartphones and tablets. RealPlayer Cloud ties into the existing RealPlayer, however it also has a Web app and apps for Android, iOS and Roku. The service has 2GB of free cloud storage and more storage for a monthly fee.[28] It was renamed to RealTimes in May 2015, with a new focus on creating and sharing "Stories"—video collages of users' personal photos and videos, set to background music.[29]
Helix[edit]
Main article: Helix (multimedia project)
Helix is a suite of streaming media software and services intended for digital TV set-top boxes, mobile devices, as well as QuickTime, Flash and other programs.[30][31][32] It includes the Helix open-source code and the Helix Universal Server, which hosts, distributes and manages digital rights for multimedia content.[32] Helix competes with the Windows Media 9 Series from Microsoft, but has a greater emphasis on open-source.[31][32] Helix was announced in July 2002.[31] Support for mobile devices was added in November 2005.[33] It was discontinued in October 2014.[34]
GameHouse[edit]
Main article: GameHouse
RealNetworks entered the gaming market in October 2001 with RealArcade, a PC game distribution application that allows users to play casual video games for free for 60 minutes, then decide if they want to purchase it.[35][36] Many of the games were developed by GameHouse, which RealNetworks acquired for $35.6 million in 2004.[37] In 2010, RealNetworks re-launched its gaming division under the name Gamehouse.[38] It began focusing on social games, such as Facebook apps,[39] and in 2013 acquired casual casino games company, Slingo, for $15.6 million.[40]
Other products and technologies[edit]

RealAudio, a compressed audio format
RealDownloader, a download manager
RealPlayer, a media player
RealVideo, a compressed video format

History[edit]
RealNetworks (then known as Progressive Networks) was founded in 1994 by an ex-Microsoft executive, Rob Glaser and a management team including Phil Barrett, Andy Sharpless, and Stephen Buerkle. The original goal of the company was to provide a distribution channel for politically progressive content. It evolved into a technology venture to leverage the Internet as an alternative distribution medium for audio broadcasts. Progressive Networks became RealNetworks in September 1997.
RealNetworks are pioneers in the streaming media markets and broadcast one of the earlier audio events over the Internet — a baseball game between the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners — on September 5, 1995. They announced streaming video technology in 1997. According to some accounts,[which?] by 2000, more than 85% of streaming content on the Internet was in the Real format.[4]
Despite this success, problems arose because Real's primary business model depended upon the sale of streaming media server software, and Microsoft and Apple were giving those products away. As servers from Microsoft and Apple became more capable, Real's server sales inevitably eroded.[5]
On January 20, 2000, RealNetworks, Inc. filed an injunction against Streambox, Inc. regarding the aforementioned company's product designed to convert Real Audio (.rm) formatted files to other formats.[6] On December 4, 2001, the company was to launch the first coordinated effort to sell and deliver music from major record labels over the Internet, part of a broader initiative by the company to develop subscription Internet services aimed at Web users with fast Internet connections.[7] In 2002, a strategic alliance was formed between RealNetworks and Sony Corporation to expand collaboration.[8] In October, 2005, Microsoft agreed to pay RealNetworks $460 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit.[9]
In August 2003, RealNetworks acquired Listen.com's Rhapsody music service, and renamed it RealRhapsody. It offered streaming music downloads for a monthly fee. In January 2004, RealNetworks announced the RealPlayer Music Store, featuring digital rights management (DRM) restricted music in the AAC file format. After some initial tries to push their own DRM scheme (named Helix DRM) onto all device manufacturers with the Creative Zen Xtra and the Sansa e200r as the only existing compliant devices, they sparked controversy by introducing a technology called Harmony that allowed their music to play on iPods as well as Microsoft Windows Media Audio DRM-equipped devices using a "wrapper" that would convert Helix DRM into the two other target DRM schemes.[citation needed]
The domain real.com attracted at least 67 million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com study.[10]
On April 6, 2010, Rhapsody was spun off from RealNetworks.[citation needed]
In July 2013, RealNetworks acquired Slingo for $15.6 million.[11] The company introduced a mobile phone app called Listen in April 2014 that plays custom ringtones to those calling the user's phone.[12]
Headquarters[edit]




RealNetworks headquarters


RealNetworks has its headquarters in Seattle, Washington in the Home Plate Center building in SoDo across from Safeco Field, sharing the building with King5 and Logic 20/20 Consulting.[13][14]
Products and services[edit]
Subscription services[edit]
In 2000, one of the initial products, the download manager RealDownload, was already used for pushing small software, such as games, to subscribers' computers. On top of the subscription for RealDownload and using its RealVideo streaming technology, a service called GoldPass, including unlimited access for video snippets from ABC and movie previews, was offered to registered users for a monthly $10 fee.[15] More content was added through deals with CBS for the reality show Big Brother and NBA basketball.[citation needed]
After the dot-com bubble, RealNetworks cut most of the resources. Some of the content was lost, some was limited to local markets, e.g., Ministry of Sound was available only to UK subscribers. With the increase in broadband usage, RealNetworks started offering live broadcasts of CNN International, BBC World, Al-Jazeera etc., separately for prices between $6 and $12, or bundled in the SuperPass for about $35 a month depending on the market. Between 2003 and 2006, SuperPass included, for European subscribers, unlimited access to UEFA Champions League full-length game recordings.[citation needed]
RealDVD[edit]
On September 30, 2008, RealNetworks launched a new product called RealDVD. The software allows any user to save a copy of a DVD movie they own. The company was later found to have violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and RealNetworks' contract with the DVD Copy Control Association, as the software also allowed anyone to save a movie they do not legally own. (See RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Ass'n, Inc.).[16] The product's distribution was barred by a court injunction.[17][18]
Real Alternative[edit]
Real Alternative is a discontinued software bundle that allows users to play RealMedia files without installing RealPlayer.[19][20] The last version, 2.02, was released on February 19, 2010. It included Media Player Classic.[21][22]
Beginning in 2010, RealNetworks sued Hilbrand Edskes, a 26-year-old Dutch webmaster for having inserted hyperlinks to Real Alternative on his site www.codecpack.nl. RealNetworks alleges that Real Alternative is a reverse engineered package.[23] Meanwhile, Download.com[20] and FileHippo[19] continue to host the software product, unchallenged.[24]
In November 2011 RealNetworks' case against Edskes was dismissed and RealNetworks was ordered to pay him €48,000 in damages.[25][26] Details of the case and judgement have been published.[27]
RealTimes (formerly RealPlayer Cloud)[edit]
RealNetworks in September 2013 launched RealPlayer Cloud, a service that adds the ability to share videos recorded on smartphones and tablets. RealPlayer Cloud ties into the existing RealPlayer, however it also has a Web app and apps for Android, iOS and Roku. The service has 2GB of free cloud storage and more storage for a monthly fee.[28] It was renamed to RealTimes in May 2015, with a new focus on creating and sharing "Stories"—video collages of users' personal photos and videos, set to background music.[29]
Helix[edit]
Main article: Helix (multimedia project)
Helix is a suite of streaming media software and services intended for digital TV set-top boxes, mobile devices, as well as QuickTime, Flash and other programs.[30][31][32] It includes the Helix open-source code and the Helix Universal Server, which hosts, distributes and manages digital rights for multimedia content.[32] Helix competes with the Windows Media 9 Series from Microsoft, but has a greater emphasis on open-source.[31][32] Helix was announced in July 2002.[31] Support for mobile devices was added in November 2005.[33] It was discontinued in October 2014.[34]
GameHouse[edit]
Main article: GameHouse
RealNetworks entered the gaming market in October 2001 with RealArcade, a PC game distribution application that allows users to play casual video games for free for 60 minutes, then decide if they want to purchase it.[35][36] Many of the games were developed by GameHouse, which RealNetworks acquired for $35.6 million in 2004.[37] In 2010, RealNetworks re-launched its gaming division under the name Gamehouse.[38] It began focusing on social games, such as Facebook apps,[39] and in 2013 acquired casual casino games company, Slingo, for $15.6 million.[40]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
