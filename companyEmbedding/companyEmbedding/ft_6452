Tract #284, a 1.25 acre parcel of sixteen (16) 1.25 acre individual parcels that is about ¾ mile from SR74. Attractive wooded parcel of a few oaks, pines  &  cabbage trees. Parcel is ideal for a rural home place where privacy prevails, neighbors are real neighbors, folks are country focused and the children or grandchildren can enjoy themselves as if they were on huge acreage. This parcel is practical for a small AG oriented owner who dabbles in horses, small animal husbandry or even a gentleman’s estate. Many do not realize this but you can operate your business from here if you abide by the County rules. Fronts on Gewant Blvd. Nice homes nearby in the overall neighborhood. One home per parcel here. Land is zoned AG (Agriculture) which retains the open character of the land. Uses are conservation, agriculture, low-density residential, recreation and other uses. AG is associated with noise/odors/dust  &  other uses generally incompatible with urban life. District provides for AG operations at very low densities for buyers who want to live in an AG environment. Raising of cattle/sheep/swine  &  poultry/dairy/processing of dairy products/breeding  &  training/boarding of animals associated with or kept in support of AG operations. Harvest/cultivate  &  process/sale of crops grown on premises, including nursery/aquaculture  &  family day care  &  citriculture.

Effect of wildfire on abundance, detection probability, and arthropod prey base of Sacramento Mountain salamanders (Aneides hardii) [Poster]Product Type: PresentationYear: 2007Author(s): Ramotnik, C.ASuggested Citation: Ramotnik, C.A. 2007. Effect of wildfire on abundance, detection probability, and arthropod prey base of Sacramento Mountain salamanders (Aneides hardii) [Poster]. On May 11, 2000, a wildfire burned almost 8,000 acres of high-elevation forest in south-central New Mexico, within the range of the Sacramento Mountain salamander, Aneides hardii. Although the fire caused an immediate temporary increase in the ability to detect salamanders on severely burned sites, counts of salamanders on those areas declined sharply one year after the fire and have remained low for 5 years. Population estimates were highest on lightly burned sites, intermediate on unburned, and lowest on severely burned sites. Coverboard surveys of salamanders may be preferable over time-constrained searches because the size of the search area is standardized and the relationship to actual population levels is known. Detection probabilities of Aneides hardii averaged 19 to 35 percent on burned and unburned sites, and are much higher than those found in eastern plethodontid salamanders. This may reflect the drier, less hospitable, and more open nature of forests in southern New Mexico. Overall effects of the fire on the abundance and community composition of forest floor arthropods appear to be moderate with beetle and spider community composition becoming less diverse and less abundant. Family richness on burned sites has not yet returned to pre-burn levels after 5 years.
