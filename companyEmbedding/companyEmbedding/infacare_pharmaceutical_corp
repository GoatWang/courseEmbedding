FDA Soon to Prohibit Certain Omega-3 Fatty Acid Health Claims 
Companies marketing their Omega-3 products as a "high source" of DHA/EPA will likely have to modify their promotional messaging. Beacause the FDA has not yet established a reference of nutrient levels for DHA/EPA, it is recommended that marketers use percentage statements or qualified health claims for their Omega-3 products instead. 


May 6, 2014
Can Vitamin D Help Lower Blood Pressure?
Early research published in the European Journal of Epidemiology found that oral ingestion of Vitamin D3 over the course of 3 months may help lower systolic blood pressure in certain populations. More studies linking Vitamin D consumption and and reduced blood pressure are needed before marketers can safely make those claims.


April 25, 2014
Blended Protein Manuacturing Benefits
A double blind randomized clinical trial conducted by the University of Texas Medial Branch compared amino acid delivery to the muscle using soy-dairy protein blend versus a single whey protein. The soy-dairy protein blend delivered key amino acids roughly one hour longer than the whey protein blend.

Package Design


Label and Package Design Services









Great Design Matters, But So Does Compliance
Good nutritional packaging design isn’t just about aesthetics, it’s also about the customers’ experience getting into the product, the materials they interact with, the warnings they must read before consumption and even the steps they should take after depleting their supply.
Maker’s Nutrition excels at preparing the package and label design for nutritional supplements because we address all aspects of interaction: visual, tactile, information.   Our graphic designers take pride in delivering the whole package.

Selling Supplements With Non-Compliant Labels is Against the Law






Our team is up to speed on the latest FDA’s labeling regulations for dietary supplements guidelines: typography and font sizes, minimum required information, prioritization of information, directions & warnings, and ingredient formatting – we will make recommendations on your existing label design if we discover issues.


The FDA Compliance Service is complimentary for only for customers manufacturing supplements with Makers Nutrition – it is advised that all products be reviewed by an attorney specializing in FDA law for nutraceuticals.

FDA Soon to Prohibit Certain Omega-3 Fatty Acid Health Claims 
Companies marketing their Omega-3 products as a "high source" of DHA/EPA will likely have to modify their promotional messaging. Beacause the FDA has not yet established a reference of nutrient levels for DHA/EPA, it is recommended that marketers use percentage statements or qualified health claims for their Omega-3 products instead.

Can Vitamin D Help Lower Blood Pressure?
Early research published in the European Journal of Epidemiology found that oral ingestion of Vitamin D3 over the course of 3 months may help lower systolic blood pressure in certain populations. More studies linking Vitamin D consumption and and reduced blood pressure are needed before marketers can safely make those claims.

Package Design


Label and Package Design Services









Great Design Matters, But So Does Compliance
Good nutritional packaging design isn’t just about aesthetics, it’s also about the customers’ experience getting into the product, the materials they interact with, the warnings they must read before consumption and even the steps they should take after depleting their supply.
Maker’s Nutrition excels at preparing the package and label design for nutritional supplements because we address all aspects of interaction: visual, tactile, information.   Our graphic designers take pride in delivering the whole package.

Selling Supplements With Non-Compliant Labels is Against the Law






Our team is up to speed on the latest FDA’s labeling regulations for dietary supplements guidelines: typography and font sizes, minimum required information, prioritization of information, directions & warnings, and ingredient formatting – we will make recommendations on your existing label design if we discover issues.


The FDA Compliance Service is complimentary for only for customers manufacturing supplements with Makers Nutrition – it is advised that all products be reviewed by an attorney specializing in FDA law for nutraceuticals.

FDA Soon to Prohibit Certain Omega-3 Fatty Acid Health Claims 
Companies marketing their Omega-3 products as a "high source" of DHA/EPA will likely have to modify their promotional messaging. Beacause the FDA has not yet established a reference of nutrient levels for DHA/EPA, it is recommended that marketers use percentage statements or qualified health claims for their Omega-3 products instead.
