Andrew Phillip Smith













Home 


My name is Andrew Phillip Smith and I am the author of several books and articles on Gnosticism, early Christianity and esoterica. My books include John the Baptist and the Last Gnostics, Lost Teachings of the Cathars, Secret history of the gnostics,  A Dictionary of Gnosticism, The Gnostics: History • Tradition • Scriptures • Influence, The Lost Sayings of Jesus: Annotated & Explained, Gnostic Writings on the Soul: Annotated & Explained, and The Gospel of Philip: Annotated & Explained. I’m also editor of The Gnostic: A Journal of Gnosticism, Western Esotericism and Spirituality.
Now out: John the Baptist and the Last Gnostics: the Secret history of the Mandaeans.

Among the casualties of the western intervention in Iraq and the recent activities of ISIS are the Mandeans of Southern Iraq. These peace-loving people are now fleeing to the west . They are the last Gnostics, the only surviving remnant of the ancient sects who taught the direct knowledge of God, created their own gospels and myths and were persecuted as heretical by the church in the second and third centuries. The Mandeans place weekly river baptisms at the centre of their religious life and the primary exemplar of their religion is none other than John the Baptist. What is the real history of this mysterious and long lived sect? Can the Mandean peoples really be traced back to the first century? And who was John the Baptist? This book follows the history of the Mandeans from their present plight back through their earliest encounters with the West, their place in Islamic counties, their possible influence on the Templars, back to their origins as a first century baptismal sect connected to John the Baptist and beyond.

Description





                                            "The Gospel Of Philip" is one of the most exciting and accessible of the Gnostic texts found at Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945. The source of Dan Brown's intriguing speculations about Mary Magdalene in his best-selling novel "The Da Vinci Code", the "The Gospel Of Philip" draws on ancient imagery - the natural world, the relationships between women, men and family, the ancient distinctions between lord and servants, free people and slaves and pagans, Jews and Christians - to offer us insight into the spiritual interpretation of scripture that is at the foundation of Christianity. "The Gospel Of Philip" unravels the discourses, parables and sayings of the second-century text to explore a spiritual, non-literal interpretation of the Bible. Along with this elegant and accurate new translation from the original Coptic, Andrew Phillip Smith probes the symbolism and metaphors at the heart of the "Gospel of Philip" to reveal otherwise unrecorded sayings of Jesus, fragments of Gnostic mythology and parallels to the teachings of Jesus and Paul. He, also, examines the joyful imagery of rebirth, salvation and mystical union in the bridal chamber that was the pursuit of Christian Gnosticism.
Now you can experience this ancient Gospel even if you have no previous knowledge of early Christian or Gnostic thought. This "SkyLight Illuminations" edition provides important insights into the historical context and major themes of the Gospel of Philip, and give you a deeper understanding of the Gospel's overarching message: deciphering our own meaning behind the symbols of this world increases and enriches our understanding of God.
