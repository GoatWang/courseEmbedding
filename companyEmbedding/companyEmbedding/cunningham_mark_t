The New Curriculum




Price:
$766.00









Yes, this is the seminar that caused all the fuss. When I set out to create
a new "Intro" curriculum, I wanted to insure that the attendees would walk
out as competent and confident hypnotists - I wanted to draw a sharp
contrast between what generally passes as a certification event and the type
of hypnosis that will actually WORK in the Real World.  Although we swore we would NEVER release these tapes as a product, in order to celebrate our new store in style we're releasing a very limited supply of these DVDs -- when they're gone, this product goes off the site once again!  Order yours TODAY!

















The Essential Marknosis




Price:
$396.00









Apply hypnotic conditioning in your everyday life and allow yourself to become Fully Human, This course teaches you to harness energy and power, to focus on working towards and reaching your goals. The trick is to become Aware while going about YOUR life -- not to Wake Up only in some therapy room, dojo or drum circle. To become Aware in real life, and they stay that way. Through a series of exercises and demonstrations, Matser Hypnotist Mark Cunningham leads you through the steps of self-hypnotic conditioning for permanent and positive change in Your life.





Trance In The First Place




Price:
$15.00









The process of using Trance to explore your own possibilities in life begins with having the experience in the first place. You have to learn the fundamentals in order to advance. Following this preparatory induction trains you to quickly and easily slip into a powerful state of Trance, one where you are free to imagine, experience and make your own beliefs, behaviors and sensations of the person that you want to be. A dreamy trip through your own possibilities for Tranceformation and change. This CD is for those who respond best to a metaphorical approach rather than direct suggestion. 47 Minute Audio CD 





All The Way Down




Price:
$15.00









Not everyone starts out having an unqualified eagerness to slip into something as amazing and powerful as Trance. For those who prefer their experiences to have a nominal sense of sequence and order to them, I recorded this induction to give a new student a countdown to perfect comfort and relaxation, open to suggestion and satisfaction. Each sensible step releases another layer of restrictions and barriers to change, until you become accustomed to entering Trance and making the fundamental changes in beliefs and behaviors that prepare you for taking your life into your own hands. A classic induction, deepening techniques looping on and on, a perfectly reasonable removal of any and all barriers to trance, and a set of powerful direct suggestions that train you easily and naturally embrace Trance for self-directed Change. If you've got a pulse, this one will work for you! (41 Minute CD) 





Beginning The Work




Price:
$15.00









This CD was prepared as a pre-conditioning tool for the attendees of the First Awakenings Seminar. The best preparation for this seminar (given that its focus was on the tasks and techniques you need to practice every day on the Path to self-development) lay in discovering your own source of Energy for transformation, and learning to use the power of your subconscious mind while you sleep to dream new solutions to the questions of your day. A powerful induction sequence, a vivid and sustainable introduction to the Microcosmic Orbit of life energy, and a perfect framework for harnessing the wisdom of the subconscious in service of your conscious goals. Fair warning to you all - we're getting lots of letters about people feeling free to make HUGE changes in their lives after using this CD. (50 Minute Audio CD) 





Learning To Love It




Price:
$15.00









Embark on fantastic journey; inhibitions disappear as you are shown the joy change can bring into your life.This conditioning CD is meant for those who desire Change yet find something fearful about the process of change itself.  Through an elegant series of interlocking suggestions and imagery, Learning To Love It leads the student not only to remove their own obstacles to a specific change, but also to openly embrace the process of continual change and improvement as a way of life.  The CD also recalls and reinforces the mechanisms used in the introductory CDs such as Beginning The Work, Trance In The First Place and All The Way Down. 1 Audio CD 





Choosing Perfect Health




Price:
$15.00









I was joking at a recent seminar that perhaps I should put some pre-requisites on my trainings - like you have to have an adequate job, a decent and private place to stay, and you had to be in good personal health. Because the fact is that until you've solved the basic equation of day-to-day existence, you're not going to have the time, energy or opportunity to discover just what it means to Become Fully Human. Of the three, by far the most important criterion is sound personal health. So, I prepared this induction to provide a compelling and positive boost to your desire for active, radiant health. Your diet will change, your attitude towards working out improves and you find that healthy desires and actions become your natural way of thinking.   (46Minute CD)





Hypnotic Awakenings




Price:
$156.00









You can free yourself from the dead weight of previous conditioning. If you're Human, you have a pulse, and you are willing to admit that what you were doing before isn't working for you now, you can openup to new learnings. You get to decide just who you're going to become. While you do this, you learn how to design and get futures for yourself that will really, really, work for you! 
This audio CD set has Mark ripping through a day of exposing the mechanisms of coming Awake though hypnotic conditioning - conditioning that puts you in the driver's seat of your own psyche. Rowdy, ribald and Real - it's the famous Marknosis blend of solid theory, to-the-point demonstrations and exercises, Real True Stories, and set-piece inductions that hammer the points home and Change Your Mind Forever!





Major Mark




Price:
$25.00









Once there was a highly intelligent, impressionable young man who found himself in a war zone. And he went so far into trance he still hasn't come out! Meet Major Mark as he guides you through the fundamentals of hypnosis through lecture, demonstration and exercises. And in the Boys With Toys induction, install the critical beliefs and attitudes of an elite warrior so that your unconscious mind will serve and protect you!





Personal Ecology For Men




Price:
$25.00









Back when I was teaching seminars just for men, I discovered that one of the greatest barriers to a man's personal growth was their current sense of masculinity -- what it meant to be a man, what it felt like, and what needed to change in order to free themselves to be the man they wanted to be.  If this rings true for you as well, then read on.
