How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Moreno, Erik E carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Moreno, Erik E currently holds license 54149 (Hvac A/C Technician (Certified)), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Moreno, Erik E



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Moreno, Erik E



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Moreno, Erik E



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

Professor Moreno joined the faculty in 2013 with more than 20 years of work experience in the field of early child development, including direct service with children and families, curriculum and assessment development, social policy, community partnerships, program evaluation, and original research.
Dr. Moreno studies adult-child interactions (parents, teachers, and other early childhood service providers) and how these can serve as a buffering influence for children who have experienced adversity. In particular, she is interested in how invested adults can adjust their behavior with the children in their care  to minimize the negative effects these early stressful experiences tend to have on the transition from automatic to effortful learning. Thus, Dr. Moreno is studying and developing interventions that train adults to support children’s self-regulation and executive function, which in turn promote children’s ability to successfully engage with increasingly dynamic and cognitively demanding contexts.
Dr. Moreno is also involved in on-the-ground efforts to implement early childhood research. She consults with community organizations and policy makers on how systems do or don’t promote caregivers’ child-supportive behaviors. Examples of implementation topics of interest include the impact of the accountability and standards movement on developmentally appropriate practice, feasible models for parent and professional development and training, appropriate uses of data and research in grant-making and program continuous improvement, and innovative collaborations to increase the impact of social services and early education.
