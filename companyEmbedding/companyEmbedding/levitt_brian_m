Trevor went on to earn a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Yale University, and moved to Denver in 2012 together with his wife and growing family. They were attracted by the vibrant and dynamic growth of the city, natural beauty of the state, the and the positive temperament of the people here.  Trevor enjoys applying the technical and analytical approach of engineering to the development space. He is always seeking to understand why things are the way they are, and how to improve the efficiency of processes. Aside from a brief stint in engineering, Trevor has enjoyed business from a young age, working for his father’s firm in several locations. Trevor has also worked in investment, working to construct a portfolio for Hines’ non-real-estate investments in the wake of 2008.

Trevor’s Dad, Gerald D. Hines, is an unofficial third partner in NAVA. Gerald serves as a mentor to Trevor and a guide to NAVA’s business activities, on a daily basis.
