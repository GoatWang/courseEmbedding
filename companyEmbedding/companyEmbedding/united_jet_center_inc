UNITED JET CENTER INC SEC Filing Form 10-Q Quartely report 1/2017, submited: 2017-01-17<< back to list of filingsForm 10-QThe SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.

UNITED REFINING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Unaudited)   


 1.
 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of United Refining Company (URC) and its
subsidiaries, United Refining Company of Pennsylvania and its subsidiaries and Kiantone Pipeline Corporation and its subsidiary (collectively, the Company). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.  The Company is a petroleum refiner and marketer in its primary market area of Western New York
and Northwestern Pennsylvania. Operations are organized into two business segments: wholesale and retail.  The wholesale segment is responsible for the acquisition of crude oil, petroleum refining, supplying petroleum products to the retail segment and the marketing of petroleum products to wholesale and
industrial customers. The retail segment operates a network of Company operated retail units under the Red Apple Food
Mart® and Country Fair® brand names selling petroleum products under the Kwik Fill®, Citgo® and Keystone® brand names, as well as convenience and grocery items. 
The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Refining, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Acquisition Corp.,
which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Red Apple Group, Inc. (the Parent).  The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule
10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three months ended November 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending August 31, 2017. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Companys Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In May, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides
guidance for revenue recognition. The standards core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09. This guidance will now be effective for our financial statements in the annual
period beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance and do not expect adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements. 
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which
requires debt issuance costs related directly to notes payable be deducted from the face amount of that note and the amortization of such costs be classified as interest expense. Effective November 30, 2016, the Company adopted the accounting
and reporting requirements included in ASU 2015-03 and has applied these requirements retrospectively. Accordingly, the Company has included $5,150,000 of previously reported deferred financing cost assets in long-term debt, net of current
installments in its August 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of these accounting and reporting requirements resulted in an increase in interest expense and a decrease in other expense of $327,000 and $275,000 on the consolidated
statements of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

UNITED REFINING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Unaudited)   
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial
Instruments  Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurements, presentation and disclosure of
financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance when effective and
adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU-2016-02 Leases, which replaces the existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 840. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The guidance requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as finance leases or operating leases. Both finance leases and operating leases will
result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a
straight-line total lease expense. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 which includes guidance to clarify how companies present and classify certain
cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including contingent consideration payments made after a business acquisition and debt extinguishment costs. Specifically, cash payments to settle a contingent consideration liability
which are not made soon after the acquisition date should be classified as cash used in financing activities up to the initial amount of contingent consideration recognized with the remaining amount classified as cash flows from operating
activities. The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance when effective and adoption is not expected to have a
material effect on the financial statements.

 Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (LCM), with cost being determined under the Last-in, First-out (LIFO) method for crude oil and petroleum product inventories and the First-in,
First-out (FIFO) method for merchandise. Supply inventories are stated at either the LCM or replacement cost and include various parts for the refinery operations. 
Inventories consist of the following:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Unaudited)   
As of November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016, the replacement
cost of LIFO inventories exceeded their LIFO carrying values on the balance sheets by approximately $3,397,000 and $4,718,000, respectively, which includes the LCM inventory write-down of $9,540,000 and $13,052,000, respectively, and a LIFO increase
of $6,143,000 and $8,334,000, respectively.

group of lenders led by PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the Agent), and PNC Capital Markets LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and Bookrunner. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, dated May 18, 2011 and last amended June 18, 2013, by and between the Company and certain subsidiaries and PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (the Existing Credit Facility). The Credit Agreement
will terminate on October 19, 2020 (the Expiration Date). Until the Expiration Date, the Company may borrow on the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) on a borrowing base formula set forth in the Credit Agreement.
 Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company increased its existing senior secured revolving credit facility
from $175,000,000 to $225,000,000. The New Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an amount not to exceed $50,000,000 without additional approval from the lenders named in the Credit Agreement if existing lenders agree to increase their
commitments or additional lenders commit to fund such increase. Interest under the New Revolving Credit Facility is calculated as follows: (a) for domestic base rate borrowings, at (i) the greater of the Agents prime rate, federal
funds rate plus .5% or the daily LIBOR rate plus 1%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 1.25% to 1.75%, and (b) for euro-rate borrowings, at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.25% to 2.75%. The applicable margin will
vary depending on a formula calculating the Companys average unused availability under the facility. As of November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016, there were no base rate or euro-rate borrowings outstanding under the
facility. Letters of credit totaling $8,753,000 were outstanding at November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016.  In addition, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a term loan in the amount of $250,000,000, which was made in a single drawing on the Closing Date (Term Loan and,
together with the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit Obligations). Under the Term Loan, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for domestic rate borrowings, at (i) the greater of the Agents prime
rate, federal funds rate plus .5% or the daily LIBOR rate plus 1%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 1.75% to 2.25%, and (b) for euro-rate borrowings, at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75% to 3.25%. The applicable margin
will vary depending on a formula calculating the Companys average unused availability under the facility. The Term Loan is prepayable in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The Term Loan shall be paid in
full on or prior to the Expiration Date and shall be paid in equal quarterly amounts based on a ten-year straight line amortization schedule.  The Credit Obligations are secured by a first priority security interest in certain cash accounts, accounts receivable, inventory, the refinery, including a related tank farm, and the capital stock of
Kiantone. At such time as the Term Loan is repaid in full, and provided no event of default exists, the security interest in the refinery and the equity interest in Kiantone shall be released.

The Credit Agreement requires minimum undrawn availability of
$15,000,000 at all times prior to the repayment of the Term Loan and the greater of 12.5% of the maximum New Revolving Credit Facility or $25,000,000 after the repayment of the Term Loan. The Company is also required to maintain a consolidated net
worth of no less than $100,000,000. The Credit Agreement includes customary mandatory prepayment provisions, including in connection with non-ordinary course asset sales, equity issuances and the incurrence of additional debt. Unless assets sold in
non-ordinary course transactions were included in the borrowing base for the New Revolving Credit Facility, mandatory prepayments shall be applied first to the repayment of the Term Loan and then the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Credit
Agreement also includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, covenants related to the fixed charge coverage ratio, payment of fees, conduct of business, maintenance of existence and assets, payment of
indebtedness and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, intercompany obligations, affiliate transactions, amendments to organizational documents, and financial statements. 
The proceeds of the Credit Agreement were used to (i) repay and satisfy in full those certain 10.500% senior secured
notes due 2018 (the Senior Secured Notes due 2018), (ii) provide for the Companys general corporate needs, including working capital requirements and capital expenditures and (iii) pay the fees and expenses associated
with the Credit Agreement.  In connection with the redemption of all its Senior Secured Notes due 2018, the
Company recorded a loss of $19,316,000 on the early extinguishment of debt consisting of a redemption premium of $7,009,000, a consent payment of $6,536,000, a write-off of unamortized net debt discount of $3,600,000 and a write-off of deferred
finance costs of $2,171,000.  Term Loan  due 2022 
On December 9, 2015, United Refining Company of New York Inc. (as Borrower) and United Refining Company of
Pennsylvania (as Fee Owner), entered into a Loan Agreement with a bank, in the amount of $50,000,000 which matures on December 9, 2022. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for LIBOR Loans, at either the
LIBOR plus 2.50% or the Prime Rate, (b) for Reference Rate Loans, the Prime Rate and (c) for Fixed Rate Loans, at the Fixed Rate. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will make 84 monthly principal installments of approximately
$129,000 with the remaining principal balance due on December 9, 2022. The loan is secured by a first lien mortgage on certain convenience store units owned by United Refining Company of Pennsylvania and contains various covenants applicable to
the Borrower, which include, among others, maintaining a debt service coverage ratio. Payments due under a master lease between URC and the Borrower are guaranteed by the Company. Proceeds of the loan were used for general corporate purposes of the
Company.  Term Loan  due 2023 
On October 20, 2016, Kwik-Fil, Inc. (as Borrower) and United Refining Company of Pennsylvania (as Fee Owner), entered
into a loan agreement with a bank in the amount of $25,000,000 which matures on October 20, 2023. Pursuant to the loan agreement, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for LIBOR Loans, at either the LIBOR plus 2.50% or the Prime Rate,
(b) for Reference Rate Loans, the Prime Rate and (c) for Fixed Rate Loans, at the greater of the Fixed Rate or 4.25% per annum. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will make 83 monthly principal installments of approximately
$83,000 with the remaining principal balance due on October 20, 2023. The loan is secured by a first lien mortgage on certain convenience store units owned by United Refining Company of Pennsylvania and contains various covenants applicable to
the Borrower, which

 As of November 30, 2016, $885,000 of contributions have been made to the Company
pension plans for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2017.  The Company accrues post-retirement benefits
other than pensions, during the years that the employees render the necessary service, of the expected cost of providing those benefits to an employee and the employees beneficiaries and covered dependents. 
 


 6.
 Fair Value Measurements  The carrying values of all financial instruments classified as a current asset or a current liability approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the
long-term debt was less than its carrying value at November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016 by $354,000 and $220,000, respectively.   


 7.
 Enbridge Agreements  On July 31, 2014, URC and Kiantone (together the Company Parties), on the one hand, and Enbridge Energy Limited Partnership (EEPL) and Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (EPI
and, together with EEPL, the Carriers), on the other hand, entered into a letter agreement (the Letter Agreement) with respect to approximately 88.85 miles of pipeline owned by the Carriers, which transports crude oil from
Canada to the Companys Kiantone Pipeline in West Seneca, New York and serves the Companys refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania (Line 10). 
  13 


Table of Contents
UNITED REFINING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  (Unaudited)   
Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Company agreed to fund certain
integrity costs necessary to maintain Line 10 (the Integrity Costs). The Carriers actual expenses with respect to the integrity costs will be recorded against Integrity Costs paid for any subsequent year, as well as against any
Replacement Costs, which are defined and discussed below.  In addition, the Company agreed to pay for half the
cost of replacing certain portions of Line 10 in accordance with a plan agreed to between the Company Parties and the Carriers. The Company will pay 50% of the estimated expenses of the replacement project for each segment of Line 10 to be replaced
(the Replacement Costs) within 30 days of its receipt of an invoice for the same, along with a project management fee of 2.25%. Each Carrier will initially fund the remaining 50% of the Replacement Costs during construction, provided
that the Company will reimburse the Carriers for their actual cost of funds during the construction process. Once construction is complete and each replaced segment of Line 10 is put into service, and assuming the Company has not exercised its
rights to purchase Line 10 pursuant to the Put and Call Agreement (as defined and discussed below), the Company will repay the Carriers the 50% of the Replacement Costs they funded over a 10-year period. 
On April 8, 2015 (the Execution Date), the Company entered into the Put and Call Option Agreement with
each of the Enbridge LP (the U.S. Agreement) and Enbridge Inc (the Canadian Agreement, and together with the U.S. Agreement, the Put and Call Options Agreement), which agreements are substantially similar.
Pursuant to the Put and Call Agreement; the Company was granted a right to purchase and the Company gave the Carriers a right to put to the Company the Carriers assignable permits related to the ownership and operation of Line 10, as well as
personal property, contract rights, records and incidental rights held solely in connection with Line 10 (collectively, the Assets). 
The Carriers Put Option is exercisable beginning on the date that is the earlier of
(a) January 1, 2026 and (b) the date that is 30 days after the latest of (i) the date on which the Carriers give notice that the Line 10 replacement work performed pursuant to the Letter Agreement is sufficiently completed (as
contemplated in the Call and Put Agreement) and (ii) the ninth (9th) anniversary of the Execution Date (the Put Option Commencement Date). The Put Option terminates on the date that is 24 months after either (a) the Put Option Commencement Date if
such date is the first of a month or (b) the first day of the calendar month immediately following the Put Option Commencement Date if it is not the first day of the month (the Put/Call Option Expiry Date). The Companys Call
Option is exercisable at any time beginning on the Execution Date and ending on the Put/Call Option Expiry Date.  The Company considered whether the Put and Call Agreement should be separated from the host contract in accordance with ASC 815 embedded derivative guidance and concluded that it doesnt meet the
criteria for separation. The Company determined that the Put and Call Agreement is interdependent with the Line 10 Agreement, and therefore is not freestanding and is accounted for as part of the Line 10 Agreement. As such we concluded that there is
no separate accounting impact of the Put and Call Agreement until it becomes probable that it will be exercised. As of November 30, 2016, neither the Company nor the Carrier have exercised their rights under the Put and Call Agreement.

 Subsequent Events  On December 30, 2016, Kwik-Fil, Inc. (as Borrower) and United Refining Company of Pennsylvania (as Fee Owner), entered into a loan agreement with a bank in the amount of $25,000,000 which matures on
October 20, 2023. Pursuant to the loan agreement, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for LIBOR Loans, at 
  14

either the LIBOR plus 2.50% or the Prime Rate, (b) for Reference Rate Loans, the Prime Rate and (c) for Fixed Rate Loans, at the greater of the Fixed Rate or 4.25% per annum. Under
the terms of the agreement, the Company will make 83 monthly principal installments of approximately $83,000 with the remaining principal balance due on October 20, 2023. The loan is secured by a first lien mortgage on certain convenience store
units owned by United Refining Company of Pennsylvania and contains various covenants applicable to the Borrower, which include, among others, maintaining a debt service coverage ratio. Payments due under a master lease between URC and the Borrower
are guaranteed by the Company. Proceeds of the loan were used for general corporate purposes of the Company.

 Item 2.
 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
Forward Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
forward looking statements may include, among other things, United Refining Company and its subsidiaries current expectations with respect to future operating results, future performance of its refinery and retail operations, capital expenditures
and other financial items. Words such as expects, intends, plans, projects, believes, estimates, may, will, should, shall,
anticipates, predicts, and similar expressions typically identify such forward looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
By their nature, all forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainties. All phases of the Companys
operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of the Companys control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could materially affect the Companys results of operations and whether the forward looking
statements ultimately prove to be correct. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements for a number of reasons. 
Although we believe our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge, investors
and prospective investors are cautioned that such statements are only projections and that actual events or results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors described in greater detail in the Companys filings with the SEC,
including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K, etc. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Companys actual consolidated quarterly
or annual operating results have been affected in the past, or could be affected in the future, by additional factors.  Prices of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, gasoline, diesel, asphalt and
other refined products. Such supply and demand are affected by, among other things:   


 
 
 
 changes in global and local economic conditions;   


 
 
 
 domestic and foreign demand for fuel products, especially in the United States, China and India; 
 


 
 
 
 worldwide political conditions, particularly in significant oil producing regions such as the Middle East, West Africa and Latin America;
  


 
 
 
 the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products and the volume of crude oil, feedstock and refined products imported
into the United States;   


 
 
 
 availability of and access to transportation infrastructure; 
 


 
 
 
 utilization rates of U.S. refineries;   


 
 
 
 the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to affect oil prices and maintain production
controls;   


 
 
 
 development and marketing of alternative and competing fuels; 
 


 
 
 
 commodities speculation;   


 
 
 
 natural disasters (such as hurricanes and tornadoes), accidents, interruptions in transportation, inclement weather or other events that can cause
unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refinery;   


 
 
 
 federal and state government regulations and taxes; and 
 


 
 
 
 local factors, including market conditions, weather conditions and the level of operations of other refineries and pipelines in our markets.

  16 


Table of Contents
Our direct operating expense structure also impacts our earnings. Our major
direct operating expenses include employee and contract labor, maintenance and energy costs. Our predominant variable direct operating cost is energy, which is comprised primarily of fuel and other utility services. The volatility in costs of fuel,
principally natural gas, and other utility services, principally electricity, used by our refinery and other operations affect our operating costs. Fuel and utility prices have been, and will continue to be, affected by factors outside our control,
such as supply and demand for fuel and utility services in both local and regional markets. Natural gas prices have historically been volatile and, typically, electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices. Future increases in fuel and utility
prices may have a negative effect on our earnings and cash flows.  All subsequent written and oral forward
looking statements attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to update any information contained herein or to publicly release the results of
any revisions to any such forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances that occur, or which we become aware of, after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
Recent Developments  The lagged 3-2-1 crackspread is measured by the difference between the prices of crude oil contracts traded on the NYMEX for the preceding month to the prices of NYMEX gasoline and heating oil contracts
in the current trading month. The Company uses a lagged crackspread as a margin indicator as it reflects the margin during the time period between the purchase of crude oil and its delivery to the refinery for processing. The lagged crackspread
for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 averaged $13.96/barrel (bbl). Through January 6, 2017 the indicated lagged crackspread for the second quarter ending February 28, 2017 averaged $18.52/bbl, a $4.56 increase from the average
for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  NYMEX crude fluctuated during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from a
low of $43.03/bbl to a high of $54.06/bbl and closed on January 6, 2017 at $53.99/bbl.  Results of Operations
 The Company is a petroleum refiner and marketer in its primary market area of Western New York and
Northwestern Pennsylvania. Operations are organized into two business segments: wholesale and retail.  The wholesale segment is responsible for the acquisition of crude oil, petroleum refining, supplying petroleum products to the retail segment and the marketing of petroleum products to wholesale and
industrial customers. The retail segment sells petroleum products under the Kwik Fill®, Citgo® and Keystone® brand names through a network of Company-operated retail units and convenience and grocery items through Company-owned gasoline stations and convenience stores under
the Red Apple Food Mart® and Country Fair® brand names.  A discussion
and analysis of the factors contributing to the Companys results of operations are presented below. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes, together with the following information, are intended to supply
interested parties with a reasonable basis for evaluating the Companys operations, but does not serve to predict the Companys future performance.

 Comparison of Fiscal Quarters Ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 
Net Sales  Retail sales increased during the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2016 by $1.1 million or .4% from the comparable period in fiscal 2015 from $290.8 million to $291.9 million. The increase was due
to a $1.4 million increase in merchandise sales offset by a $.3 million decrease in petroleum sales. The petroleum sales decrease resulted from a 1.0% decrease in retail selling prices per gallon offset by .8 million gallon or a .9% increase in
petroleum volume.  Costs of Goods Sold 
Retail costs of goods sold increased during the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2016 by $7.0 million or 2.8% from
the comparable period in fiscal 2015 from $249.6 million to $256.6 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $6.2 million in petroleum purchase costs, fuel taxes of $.1 million, freight costs of $.1 million and $.6 million in
merchandise costs.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Retail Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses remained relatively constant during the fiscal
quarters ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.  Wholesale Operations:

Comparison of Fiscal Quarters Ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 
Net Sales  Wholesale sales decreased during the quarter ended November 30, 2016 by $62.7 million or 22.0% from the comparable period in fiscal 2015 from $284.2 million to $221.5 million. The decrease was due
primarily to a 10.8% decrease in wholesale prices and 12.6% in wholesale volume.  Costs of Goods Sold (exclusive of
depreciation and amortization)  Wholesale costs of goods sold decreased during the quarter ended
November 30, 2016 by $44.9 million or 17.6% from the comparable period in fiscal 2015 from $255.2 million to $210.3 million. The decrease in wholesale costs of goods sold during this period was primarily due to a decrease in cost of raw
materials.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Wholesale SG&A expenses remained relatively constant during the quarter ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.
 Consolidated Expenses:  Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and
amortization increased during the three months ended November 30, 2016 by $.6 million from the comparable period in fiscal 2015 from $11.7 million to $12.3 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $1.2 million in amortization of
integrity and replacement costs and miscellaneous depreciation costs of $.3 million offset by a reduction in amortization of turnaround expense of $.9 million.  Interest Expense, net  Net interest expense (interest
expense less interest income) decreased during the three months ended November 30, 2016 by $2.4 million from the comparable period in fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to early redemption of Senior Notes due 2018 and the lower
interest rate on the Term Loan outstanding.  Income Tax Benefit 
The Companys effective tax rate was 37% for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources  We operate in an environment where our liquidity and capital resources are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum products, availability of credit, market uncertainty and a
variety of additional factors beyond our control. Included in such factors are, among others, the level of customer product demand, weather conditions, governmental regulations, worldwide political conditions and overall market and economic
conditions.  The following table summarizes selected measures of liquidity and capital resources (in

Primary sources of liquidity have been cash and cash equivalents, and
borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility (the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility) with PNC Bank, N.A. as Administrator (the Agent Bank). We believe available capital resources are adequate to
meet our working capital, debt service, and capital expenditure requirements for existing operations.  Our
cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds. These investments have staggered maturity dates, none of which exceed three months. They have a high degree of liquidity since the securities are traded in
public markets.  Significant Uses of Cash 
The changes in cash for the three months ended November 31, 2016 are described below.

We require a substantial investment in working capital which is susceptible to large variations during the year resulting
from purchases of inventory and seasonal demands. Inventory purchasing activity is a function of sales activity and turnaround cycles for the different refinery units. 
Maintenance and non-discretionary capital expenditures have averaged approximately $6.0 million annually over the last
three years for the refining and marketing operations. Management does not foresee any material increase in these maintenance and non-discretionary capital expenditures during fiscal year 2017 at this time. 
Future liquidity, both short and long-term, will continue to be primarily dependent on realizing a refinery margin
sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses, including planned capital expenditures. We expect to be able to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, contractual obligations, letter of credit and debt service requirements out of cash flow
from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Agreement of $225,000,000. This provides the Company with flexibility relative to its cash flow requirements in light of market fluctuations, particularly involving crude oil prices and
seasonal business cycles and will assist the Company in meeting its working capital, ongoing capital expenditure needs and for general corporate purposes.

On October 20, 2015, URC, United Refining Company of Pennsylvania,
Kiantone, United Refining Company of New York Inc., United Biofuels, Inc., Country Fair, Inc. and Kwik-Fill Corporation (collectively, the Borrowers) entered into the Credit Agreement with a group of lenders led by PNC Bank, National
Association, and PNC Capital Markets LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and Bookrunner. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Existing Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement will terminate on October 19, 2020. Until the Expiration Date, the
Company may borrow on the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) on a borrowing base formula set forth in the Credit Agreement.  Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company increased its existing senior secured revolving credit facility from $175,000,000 to $225,000,000. The New Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an
amount not to exceed $50,000,000 without additional approval from the lenders named in the Credit Agreement if existing lenders agree to increase their commitments or additional lenders commit to fund such increase. Interest under the New Revolving
Credit Facility is calculated as follows: (a) for domestic rate borrowings, at (i) the greater of the Agents prime rate, federal funds rate plus .5% or the daily LIBOR rate plus 1%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 1.25% to
1.75%, and (b) for euro-rate borrowings, at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.25% to 2.75%. The applicable margin will vary depending on a formula calculating the Companys average unused availability under
the facility. In addition, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a term loan in the amount of $250,000,000, which was made in a single drawing on the Closing Date (Term Loan and, together with the New Revolving
Credit Facility, the Credit Obligations). Under the Term Loan, interest is calculated as follows: (a) for domestic rate borrowings, at (i) the greater of the Agents prime rate, federal funds rate plus .5%
or the daily LIBOR rate plus 1%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 1.75% to 2.25%, and (b) for euro-rate borrowings, at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75% to 3.25%. The applicable margin will vary depending on a formula
calculating the Companys average unused availability under the facility. The Term Loan is prepayable in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The Term Loan shall be paid in full on or prior to the Expiration Date
and shall be paid in equal quarterly amounts based on a ten-year straight line amortization schedule. Prepayment of the Term Loan in whole or in part may be made at any time without premium or penalty. 
The Credit Obligations are secured by a first priority security interest in certain cash accounts, accounts receivable,
inventory, the refinery, including a related tank farm, and the capital stock of Kiantone. At such time as the Term Loan is repaid in full, and provided no event of default exists, the security interest in the refinery and the equity interests in
Kiantone shall be released.  Until maturity, we may borrow on a borrowing base formula as set forth in the
facility. We had standby letters of credit of $8.8 million as of November 30, 2016 and there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement resulting in net availability of $216.2 million. As of January 17, 2017, there were no
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and there were standby letters of credit in the amount of $7.4 million, resulting in a net availability of $217.6 million and the Company had full access to it. 
Although we are not aware of any pending circumstances which would change our expectation, changes in the tax laws, the
imposition of and changes in federal and state clean air and clean fuel requirements and other changes in environmental laws and regulations may also increase future capital expenditure levels. Future capital expenditures are also subject to
business conditions affecting the industry. We continue to investigate strategic acquisitions and capital improvements to our existing facilities.  Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment affect nearly all of our operations. As is the case with all the companies engaged in similar industries, we face significant
exposure from actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters. Future expenditures related to environmental matters cannot be reasonably quantified in many circumstances due to the uncertainties as to required remediation
methods and related clean-up cost estimates. We cannot predict what additional environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or
interpreted with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied.

Table of Contents
Seasonal Factors 
Seasonal factors affecting the Companys business may cause variation in the prices and margins of some of the
Companys products. For example, demand for gasoline tends to be highest in spring and summer months, while demand for home heating oil and kerosene tends to be highest in winter months. 
As a result, the margin on gasoline prices versus crude oil costs generally tends to increase in the spring and summer,
while margins on home heating oil and kerosene tend to increase in the winter.  Inflation 
The effect of inflation on the Company has not been significant during the last five fiscal years. 
 


 Item 3.
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
The Company uses its Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility to finance a portion of its operations. This
on-balance sheet financial instrument, to the extent it provides for variable rates, exposes the Company to interest rate risk resulting from changes in the Agent Banks Prime rate, the Federal Funds or LIBOR rate. As of January 17, 2017,
there were no outstanding borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility.  From time to
time, the Company uses derivatives to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in crude oil purchase costs and refining margins. Derivative products, specifically crude oil option contracts and crack spread option contracts are used to hedge the
volatility of these items. The Company accounts for changes in the fair value of its contracts by marking them to market and recognizing any resulting gains or losses in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. There has been no derivative
activity in fiscal 2017.   


 Item 4.
 Controls and Procedures.  Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2016. The
term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company is reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2016, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as
of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  There
have not been any changes in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Companys fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 


Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.


What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

The nearly 340 workers clocked out after their final shifts at Carrier's gas furnace factory. Carrier announced in February 2016 that it would close the Indianapolis plant and cut about 1,400 production jobs in a move expected to save $65 million annually by moving furnace production to Mexico.Carrier plant layoffs begin in IndianaCNN MoneyThe airplane laptop ban is overAxios6,034Reactions.

That is, for all its digital leadership and ability to crank out new, more expensive drinks, Starbucks sales are on a long-term downtrend. Seeing as employee hourly wages and benefit costs are on the rise, as are costs to open new locations, a stubborn downtrend in sales is very unwelcome. It's especially unwelcome as most on Wall Street remain obsessed with Starbucks' growth prospects -- they could be in for some unfortunate surprises on the bottom line over the next year138Reactions.

TheStreet's Action Alerts PLUS portfolio manager Jim Cramer awaits quarterly results from General Electric (GE) and Honeywell (HON) , released on Friday before the markets open. "I think they will be terrible," Cramer said in an interview about GE's results.  The only savings grace may be what a new CEO tells analysts on a conference call. John Flannery, a career GE executive, is set to take the CEO's chair on Aug. 1 from Jeffrey Immelt, whose popularity with investors waned as GE shares moved sideways in recent years. Activist Nelson Peltz's firm Trian Fund Management took a stake in the firm in 2015 and pushed for improvements.
