Jerry Ermentrout Wins 6th Annual Akira Inoue Award





 













Jerry Ermentrout Receives Sixth Akira Inoue Award for Environmental, Health and Safety Leadership









From left: Stan Meyers, president and CEO of SEMI; Don Mitchell, chairman and chief executive officer of FSI International, and chairman of the SEMI EHS Executive Committee; Gerald Ermentrout, vice president and general manager of Air Product’s Electronics Division



Gerald G. (Jerry) Ermentrout, vice president and general manager of the Electronics Division at Air Products, is the recipient of the 2005 Akira Inoue Award for outstanding achievement in environment, health and safety in the semiconductor industry. The award, presented at the SEMICON Japan exposition, is sponsored by the global industry association SEMI.

Ermentrout is recognized for his contributions to advancing EHS policies and practices at Air Products which have resulted in operational excellence in health and safety for both customers and employees, as well as the introduction of innovative products and services that provide direct environmental, health or safety benefits.

“Under Jerry Ermentrout’s leadership, Air Products’ Electronics Division has achieved industry-leading status in environmental, health and safety performance while growing roughly three times in size,” said Stanley Myers, president and CEO of SEMI. “Through his visionary business model, Jerry has established himself as a capable, responsible steward of the environment, and demonstrated that companies can achieve outstanding financial performance while simultaneously protecting the health and safety of employees, customers and neighbors.”

Achievements cited by the Akira Inoue Award committee in the selection of Ermentrout include:


Attainment of the lowest US OSHA recordable injury rate among member companies of the American Chemistry Council from 2000 to 2003 – at roughly half of the industry average


Implementation of a division-wide Basic Safety Process (BSP) which identifies hazardous situations to prevent accidents


Provision of turnkey operation of hazardous materials handling at customer sites, minimizing the potential for customers to come into contact with potentially harmful substances resulting in an average 93 percent reduction in incidents per container change since 1998, annual reduction of 8.2 million pounds of hazardous wastes and an additional 20 million pounds of raw material and process gases at the world’s largest specialty gas manufacturing facility


Development of a fundamental understanding and advanced process analytical capability in support of nitrogen trifluoride chamber cleaning, which led to a significant reduction of global warming gas emissions


Development of a screening procedure that was adopted by the Compressed Gas Association to identify products which should be designated as “Restricted Use” and a process for qualifying potential customers to whom materials should be provided


Development and implementation of a Security Vulnerability Assessment (SVA) system for the Division which was recently approved and adopted by the American Chemistry Council


Demanding and receiving the same high level of safety and environmental performance from his teams around the world, regardless of local customs or competitive pressures.




Ermentrout began his career with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. in 1975 as a participant in the company’s Career Development Program, becoming a sales engineer in 1976. In 1983, he was named business area manager for Standard Plants, and in 1987 became general manager of the Process Industries Department. Appointed general manager for the Electronics Division in 1992, he assumed his current position as vice president and general manager in 1996.

Ermentrout earned a B.S. degree in engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1970 and an M.B.A. from Lehigh University in 1980.

 Educational Background



 


Lehigh University

                  Lehigh is a premier residential research university, ranked in the top tier of national research universities each year. We are a coeducational, nondenominational, private university that offers a distinct academic environment of undergraduate and graduate students from across the globe.

Our university offers majors and programs in four colleges: The College of Arts and Sciences, The College of Business and Economics, The College of Education and The P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science.

More than 4,700 undergraduate and 2,000 graduate students call Lehigh "home." Located in Pennsylvania’s scenic Lehigh Valley, the campus is in close proximity to both New York City and Philadelphia. Lehigh is comprised of 2,358 acres, making it one of the largest private universities in the country. The Asa Packer Campus, Mountaintop Campus, and Murray H. Goodman Campus are contiguous. In 2012, the university received a Stabler Foundation gift of 755 acres in nearby Upper Saucon Township.

Since 1865, generations of students have chosen Lehigh for their educational experience. They know Lehigh is a place where they can make strong personal connections with faculty, conduct research in diverse fields of study, thrive in a dynamic campus community, form lasting bonds with Lehigh alumni, and learn from their own life experiences.

United States Naval Academy

                  As the undergraduate college of our country’s naval service, the Naval Academy prepares young men and women to become professional officers of competence, character, and compassion in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. Naval Academy students are midshipmen on active duty in the U.S. Navy. They attend the Academy for four years, graduating with Bachelor of Science degrees and then commissioning as Ensigns in the Navy or Second Lieutenants in the Marine Corps.                




Masters of Business Administration 


Lehigh University - College of Business & Economics

                  The mission of Lehigh University’s College of Business and Economics is to provide an intellectual and professional learning environment that advances knowledge through research and scholarship and that develops future leaders through experiential learning, rigorous analysis and the discipline of a strong work ethic – the hallmarks of a Lehigh University business education. The College of Business and Economics consists of five departments: accounting, economics, Perella Department of Finance, management and marketing. Its programs, accredited by the AACSB International—The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business—provide students with a solid foundation in business and economics principles.
