If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

WAIVER. Wynn Las Vegas’ waiver of any breach or failure to avail itself of any right or remedy shall not be deemed to constitute a continuing waiver of the breach, right or remedy or any other breach, right or remedy provided herein or available at law or in equity.


ILLEGAL PROVISION. If any provision contained within this Purchase Order is finally determined to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby.

Forbes Travel Guide Inspector 




Desert Bambu is the luxury bath product line used at Wynn Las Vegas. In your spacious bathroom you’ll find a collection suited for sophisticated tastes — unscented hand and face soap, lemongrass citrus body soap, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. A shower cap, cotton swabs, cotton makeup pads, polish and a soft buff cloth are also at hand to make your stay easier. If you love the Desert Bambu product so much that you want to take it home, pop the bathroom amenities in your bag. But if you feel like you’ll want a larger amount of the product, head to the Wynn LVNV store in the Wynn Esplanade at the Forbes Travel Guide Four-Star hotel and buy some to take home with you.

Overview
There’s no place like it in the world. Las Vegas, a city of half a million people carved out of unforgiving desert landscape and fueled by hedonism, may seem to exist for one purpose: entertainment. And while Vegas delivers diversions in abundance, it’s also home to a thriving arts community, a solid college scene and a smattering of industry, from interior design to energy. Still, most people come to Las Vegas to let loose, whether that takes place at a casino or one of the city’s many theaters, upscale restaurants, spas or luxury hotels. If it’s your first trip or your fiftieth, you’ll spend most of your time on Las Vegas Boulevard, also know as the Strip. Of course, not all entertainment is located on that four-mile stretch of boulevard. Las Vegas is also home to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, which is one of the nation’s most popular spots for rock climbing. And there’s the Atomic Testing Museum, which delves into Nevada’s unique role in the Cold War. Come to Las Vegas prepared to have the time of your life, but keep in mind you’re visiting the Mojave Desert. If the weather gets to be too much, you can always stay — you guessed it — inside at the gaming tables.

The Las Vegas Strip's luxe wonderland
In his most personal resort, Steve Wynn has put his name, voice and signature on just about everything at Wynn Las Vegas that you could think of, including an 18-hole golf course attached to the back of the resort and designed by Tom Fazio and Wynn himself. Wynn's penchant for fusing nature, art and luxury is also on display, with flowers and trees, waterfalls and lagoons scattered about the property along with original fine art draping the walls. The recently refreshed resort rooms average 640-square-feet in space (nearly twice as large as standard Vegas hotel rooms) and include wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling windows, the pillow-top Wynn Dream Bed (covered in 100 percent Egyptian Cotton and 300-plus-thread-count sheets) and Desert Bambu bath amenities. Entertainment includes the unique show Le Rêve – The Dream and the hopping Tryst nightclub, while shopaholics will enjoy window shopping along the Wynn Esplanade, which includes a Manolo Blahnik boutique and a Ferrari-Maserati dealership.

Two entrances off of the Strip as well as a dedicated valet service will make the area highly accessible to visitors and interior entrances will offer a natural transition and seamless flow within Wynn and Encore.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

“5 Stars All the Way- First Class”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



This is by far the classiest place in Vegas. I've literally stayed in every hotel/casino the last 25 years and watched Vegas grow and change. The Wynn absolutely defines the new Vegas and still holds true to the basics that made Vegas great. First: The Staff. The staff in this place is the best, most well trained group of casino personnel that has attention to detail and common courtesy (which you normally don't expect these days). Second: The Sportsbook. The sportsbook staff and area (which I do believe is being remodeled right now) is great. They don't talk down to you when you ask questions and they treat you with respect. Johnny Avello is running a tight ship and it shows. I've placed bets at other windows around town and they talk trash to you when you are betting! Nuts. Not at the Wynn. Third: The rooms. The rooms are well laid out and decorated to perfection. They smell clean, beds are comfortable, and it reeks of luxury. Will come back for sure!

“Very beautiful hotel with the very strange rools.”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 


via mobile




We have been here for our marriage in Las Vegas. The hotel is new and beautiful. We have been also at Mirage and at Ceaser Palace, the Wynn winning in al categories. But on the rooms they have a very strange rools about minibar - onder every buttle in minibar and on the table there are sensors. If you lift something up longer then 30 sec=you pay the full price. Same with the fridge from minibar - it you put there your own water=$25 penalty. How greedy you can be? ???The sheets will not be changed of you don't ask .

“Wynn reminds you of Classic Elegance.”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



This Hotel is simply awesome! From the mosaic floors to the works of art made of real flowers, they don't miss a thing. The Hotel pumps in fresh air, (with a memorable floral scent too), while pumping out the smoke that you normally get at the other Vegas casinos. Their rooms are not just spacious but luxurious. The mattress will take you to another level of sleep. They have all the restaurants you would ever want. The Terrace Pointe Cafe has an Eggs Benedict that is delicious and inexpensive. This is what Las Vegas used to be!


Room Tip: City Side or Golf side is great, depending on your liking.

“What Happens In Vegas Gets Shared About Vegas”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



I wasn't sure which hotel to stay at during my vacation in Las Vegas and decided on the Wynn. It turned out to be an exceptionally lucky decision. Perhaps, it was the luckiest thing that happened while in Vegas. Every aspect of the Wynn, from the staff to the facilities to the shows to the meals was excellent. There is an attention to detail throughout the hotel that makes the slightly higher cost well worth the price.

“The Best Casino in Las Vegas”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



The Wynn Hotel and Casino have the best facilities, services and food in Las Vegas. The Building Decor and Maintenance exceed all the other locations on the strip. The Cabana and Pool were amazing. The Food was excellent.

“At the Wynn you are just a number........”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



All around poor to average service from the moment we arrived until we left. Did not provide the correct rooms that we booked and when the booking was evidenced they would not rectify their error. Entire ground level casino floor stunk of cigarette smoke and cigars. We did not enjoy breathing in secondary smoke.

“Wynn reminds you of Classic Elegance.”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



This Hotel is simply awesome! From the mosaic floors to the works of art made of real flowers, they don't miss a thing. The Hotel pumps in fresh air, (with a memorable floral scent too), while pumping out the smoke that you normally get at the other Vegas casinos. Their rooms are not just spacious but luxurious. The mattress will take you to another level of sleep. They have all the restaurants you would ever want. The Terrace Pointe Cafe has an Eggs Benedict that is delicious and inexpensive. This is what Las Vegas used to be!


Room Tip: City Side or Golf side is great, depending on your liking.

“What Happens In Vegas Gets Shared About Vegas”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



I wasn't sure which hotel to stay at during my vacation in Las Vegas and decided on the Wynn. It turned out to be an exceptionally lucky decision. Perhaps, it was the luckiest thing that happened while in Vegas. Every aspect of the Wynn, from the staff to the facilities to the shows to the meals was excellent. There is an attention to detail throughout the hotel that makes the slightly higher cost well worth the price.

“The Wynn”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



Went to Las Vegas for 10 days for WSOP final event. Still one of the nicest hotels on the strip. Few areas starting to look tired and there was no sports bar when I was there. Good Gym and very good restaurants, The SW steakhouse was a standout. Quite expensive but sumptuous food and great location make it worth it.

Wynn Las Vegas, often simply referred to as Wynn, is a luxury resort and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. The US$2.7-billion resort is named after casino developer Steve Wynn and is the flagship property of Wynn Resorts. The resort covers 215 acres (87 ha). It is located at the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sands Avenue, directly across The Strip from the Fashion Show Mall.
The 614-foot (187 m)-high hotel has 49 floors, with the 2,716 rooms ranging in size from 640 sq ft (59 m2) to villas at 7,000 sq ft (650 m2). The complex also includes a 111,000 sq ft (10,300 m2) casino, a convention center with 223,000 sq ft (20,700 m2) of space and 76,000 sq ft (7,100 m2) of retail space. Together with the adjacent Encore, the entire Wynn resort complex has a total of 4,750 rooms, making it the world's seventh-largest hotel.
The resort has earned AAA five diamond, Mobil five-star, Forbes five-star, Michelin five star, and Zagat Survey Top U.S. Hotel[1] ratings, as well as one Michelin star for its restaurant Wing Lei.[2] It is considered to be one of the finest hotels in the world. Wynn Las Vegas and its sister property Encore Las Vegas collectively hold more Forbes five-star awards than any other resort and casino in the world. Wynn Las Vegas also made Forbes Award history by earning five-star ratings in every category—Hotel, Restaurant, and Spa—for two consecutive years.[3] It has held the distinction of winning the award in the hotel sector every year since 2007. The building is the first high-rise to be cleaned by an automatic window washing system.[4] The resort is named to the Condé Nast Traveller Gold List as one of the "Top Hotels in the World".[5]

History[edit]
Steve Wynn first revealed plans of a 49-story, 2,455-room, and 514-foot resort and four-acre lake in August 2001. The project did not have a formal name and would be built on the site of the Desert Inn. The project's name was revealed on October 19, 2001, as "Le Rêve", meaning "the dream" in French.
To make way for the resort, the Desert Inn's main tower was imploded on October 23, 2001. The rest of the Desert Inn was imploded on November 17, 2004. The project included the redesigning of the historic Desert Inn golf course, which was renamed the Wynn Golf Club. The remainder of the property was acquired by purchasing private residences that were generally located along Paradise Avenue. While some owners sold early on, others held out. This resulted in numerous legal actions between the various parties. In the end, the site acquired totaled 215 acres (87 ha).
In June 2002, Steve Wynn filed for an IPO to help fund the project. Wynn hired Marnell Corrao Associates to design and build the resort. The resort was built at a cost of $2.7 billion, which made it the largest privately funded construction project in the nation. The name of the resort was changed from "Le Rêve" to "Wynn Las Vegas" on June 23, 2003.
Wynn Las Vegas opened on April 28, 2005, the same day as Steve Wynn's wife, Elaine Wynn's birthday, the 55th anniversary of the original Desert Inn opening, and five years from the day Wynn purchased the Desert Inn site. Early advertising for the resort featured exterior images of the hotel tower, with Wynn standing on the roof, just above his signature logo. The initial commercial aired in local markets during the 2005 Super Bowl, eventually being nationally broadcast as opening drew near. A "teaser" website for the resort included both the commercial and a "making-of" video.
The hotel runs a monthly magazine, called "WYNN", and is available in all guest rooms at both Wynn and Encore, as well as online.
On May 12 and 13, 2007, Wynn dealers voted 444–149 in favor of representation by the Transportation Workers Union. The vote is a result of controversial policy changes made by Wynn to share tips with floor staff.[6]
Film history[edit]
Since the Wynn's completion, the resort and other hotels on the Strip has been shown in many films and television shows based on Las Vegas.
The resort is notably featured in the 2009 film 2012, where the film's main characters flee a destroyed Las Vegas by narrowly flying a plane similar to the Antonov An-225 between the crumbling Wynn and Encore towers as they collapse onto one another.
In addition, the Encore Theater was home to Beyoncé's sold-out I Am... Tour, which was featured in I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas, filmed from July 30 to August 2, 2009.
An action comedy film Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 starring Kevin James was entirely filmed at the casino. It is the first film ever shot on the property of Steve Wynn by his permission.[7]
Features[edit]




The Wynn as seen from the Las Vegas strip


In contrast to previous hotels built by Wynn, including Bellagio, The Mirage, and Treasure Island, there is no Las Vegas Strip attraction to draw in passers-by. At its opening, the Wynn was the tallest hotel building on the strip (a record which lasted two years). It was the first Vegas casino to feature a car dealership (Ferrari-Maserati).[8] Other firsts:

Combination of the room key and the casino frequent-player card into a single card.
The world's largest distribution of HDTV into hotel rooms, using high-speed Cat-6 Ethernet cables.
The largest installation of voice over IP technology for hotel phones.
The first Las Vegas casino to install RFID tags inside chips to better detect counterfeiting.[9]

Attractions[edit]
Penske-Wynn Ferrari-Maserati dealership[edit]
Wynn Las Vegas was the first resort to include a luxury car dealership. New cars include the Ferrari and Maserati brands. Used cars are sold "as-is" and include other luxury car brands, with some cars on display ranging in price from little more than $100,000 to $1.6 million. The dealership also includes parts and other car-wares.
Non-buying guests of the resort can go into the dealership to take a look around. When the resort opened, there was no fee to enter, but the dealership became so crowded that management began charging $10 for admission;[10] registered Ferrari-Maserati owners are exempted from this fee, as well as children accompanying paying adults. The Penske-Wynn is one of the few casino car exhibits in the Las Vegas Valley. Other exhibits can be found at The Palazzo, Imperial Palace and Caesars Palace. However, the Penske-Wynn Ferrari-Maserati dealership along with Lamborghini Las Vegas showroom and dealership at The Palazzo are the only two casino/dealerships in the Las Vegas area.
The dealership is placed near the valet parking of the resort, so that people can look at the model cars while waiting for their own cars to arrive.
The dealership exhibit is set to close on Wednesday, October 14, 2015.
Lake of Dreams[edit]
In a departure from the trend established by The Mirage, which opened sidewalk attractions to draw in customers, Wynn Las Vegas is constructed so that visitors enter the building to view the attractions. The main attraction is a large, curtain waterfall behind a mountain that faces the strip. The waterfall falls into a 3 acres (1.2 ha) lake.
Wynn Paradise Park[edit]
The Wynn Paradise Park has been announced for 2020.[11]
Shows[edit]
Le Rêve[edit]
Main article: Le Rêve
The first production show to open was Le Rêve. Le Rêve is set in a 1 million gallon water-oriented theater where no seat is more than 40 ft (12 m) from the stage. The production was created by Franco Dragone.
Le Rêve was the working name of the resort before it was changed to Wynn Las Vegas. "Le Rêve" means "The Dream" in French, and the name of the centerpiece painting that Steve Wynn owned, Le Rêve by Picasso.
Most recently, Wynn Las Vegas bought the rights to the show from Dragone to make some changes, including the logo. Wynn now owns all rights to the show, with Dragone still in the label.
Avenue Q[edit]
Avenue Q, a Tony Award-winning puppet and people musical which enjoyed considerable success on Broadway, was the second production show to open at Wynn. It debuted on September 8, 2005, in the 1,200-seat Broadway Theatre and closed on May 28, 2006.
Monty Python's Spamalot[edit]
Main article: Spamalot
Spamalot, a Tony Award-winning comedic musical based on Monty Python and the Holy Grail, opened for previews on March 8, 2007, at Grail Theater (formerly, The Broadway Theatre). The official run began on March 31, 2007, and starred John O'Hurley as King Arthur through September 26, 2007. The show closed on July 13, 2008.
Danny Gans[edit]
On April 17, 2008, Wynn Resorts announced that Mirage headliner Danny Gans would move to the resort in February 2009.[12] Gans moved into the theater formerly used by both Avenue Q and Spamalot, which was renamed Encore Theater and is marketed as part of the Encore expansion. Gans performed there until his death on May 1, 2009.
Nightclubs[edit]
Tryst[edit]
Tryst was the main club located in Wynn Las Vegas, famous for having a 90 foot (27 m) waterfall and lagoon in the middle of the club. The nightclub closed its doors after a successful ten-year run on November 7, 2015. A new nightclub, Intrigue, took its place on April 29, 2016.[13]
Blush Boutique Nightclub[edit]
Blush was a boutique lounge that opened on Labor Day 2007. Blush closed in 2011.

Wynn Golf and Country Club


Wynn Golf and Country Club[edit]
The Wynn Golf Course is the only golf course on the Las Vegas Strip, built on the site of the former Desert Inn course. It was designed by Steve Wynn and Tom Fazio, who previously worked together on the Shadow Creek Golf Club, in an exclusive neighborhood in nearby North Las Vegas.[15]
Tower Suites at Wynn Las Vegas[edit]
The Tower Suites at Wynn Las Vegas consists of all suites in the separated southernmost section of the main tower. These 296 rooms, all suites have a private driveway with Rolls-Royce house cars and chauffeurs, as well as a private entrance with koi pond, a separate check-in area and elevators, and a private pool area. The hotel has since become popular among celebrities and the very wealthy. In 2006, The Tower Suites at Wynn Las Vegas was evaluated independently from the rest of the property by Mobil Travel Guide for their 2007 ratings. It was awarded the first ever Mobil Five-Star rating awarded to a hotel in Las Vegas and has since received numerous other five-star awards, making the Tower Suites one of the finest boutique hotels worldwide.[16]
Encore[edit]
Main article: Encore Las Vegas
On April 28, 2006, Wynn celebrated its first anniversary by beginning construction of a second hotel tower.[17] Called Encore, the tower was a $2.3 billion, 2,034-room hotel project adjacent to the existing resort and on the remaining frontage of Las Vegas Boulevard. Encore opened on December 22, 2008.
Future development[edit]
Golf course redevelopment[edit]




The Wynn Las Vegas Golf Course


Wynn Resorts are developing a long-range master plan for the 142-acre (57 ha) golf course that will include a large mixed-use hotel, casino entertainment resort complex. The complex may include multiple waterfront hotels built around a lake offering water sports and other entertainment. The complex also may include multiple restaurants, retail offerings and entertainment venues. Wynn Resorts have not yet developed specific plans for such a complex, and there can be no assurance that such plans will be developed. Wynn Resorts cannot predict the cost of such a development or whether Wynn Resorts will be able to obtain the necessary financing for the development on suitable terms, if at all. It is not expected that any construction on the golf course land would begin before 2009.[18]
Additional villas[edit]
In February 2007, Wynn Las Vegas submitted a request for approval to construct four additional villas on the South side of the property, which would bring the total number of villas to ten. The description of the new villas closely matches that of the six existing villas on the property.[19]
Suite renovation[edit]
Wynn Las Vegas underwent significant renovation from August 2010 through April 2011, with close to 2,700 of the hotel's rooms and suites renovated. The total cost of the renovations, which also included a revamp of the Baccarat (card game) section in preparation for the winter holidays, cost US$99 million.[citation needed]
Wynn Paradise Park[edit]
Steve Wynn announced in April 2016 the development of a new $1.5 billion expansion project, currently called Wynn Paradise Park, which will include an additional hotel property holding 1,000 rooms and a lagoon that is over 35 acres which will include water skiing and other water sport activities. It is expected to open in 2020.[20]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
