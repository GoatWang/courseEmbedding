Willdan Group, Inc. Appoints Marc Tipermas to Lead Business Development as President of National Programs
ANAHEIM, Calif., Jun 11, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Willdan Group Inc. ("Willdan") (NASDAQ:WLDN), a leading provider of engineering, planning, municipal finance, homeland security, and other outsourced services to public agencies, today announced that Marc Tipermas has joined the company to lead its strategic business development efforts and serve as President of National Programs. Mr. Tipermas will focus his efforts on helping the firm to expand its core business in municipal services in California, other western states, and nationally, as well as enhancing Willdan's business development activities in the Federal market for outsourced services. He will work out of the Washington, D.C. area and split his time with Willdan's Anaheim headquarters. "I have known Marc for 25 years as a teaming partner and competitor in the engineering and professional services market," said Thomas Brisbin, Willdan's CEO. "And it was always better to team with Marc than compete against him and his company, ICF Kaiser. His strategic insights, ability to establish effective teaming relationships, and track record of successful capture management efforts will be invaluable to our company. In short, Marc will enable us to further capitalize on our unique market niche and outstanding reputation to help Willdan become a nationally recognized firm." Mr. Tipermas has spent most of his nearly 30-year career in the professional services industry in a variety of senior executive level business development and operations positions. From 1981 to 1998 he was with ICF Kaiser International, a global consulting, engineering, and program management firm with over 6,000 employees, and was named President and Chief Operating Officer of the company in 1997. More recently he was Senior Vice President for Business Development of Dynamac Corporation, an environmental consulting firm, and has also been an independent business development consultant to several nationwide engineering and consulting firms. Earlier in his career Mr. Tipermas worked at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and in 1980-81 served as the first Director of EPA's Superfund Policy and Program Management Office. Mr. Tipermas received an S.B. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and also holds Ph.D. and Masters degrees from Harvard University in political science. About Willdan Group, Inc. Founded over 40 years ago, Willdan Group, Inc. is a leading provider of outsourced services to public agencies located primarily in California and other western states. Willdan Group, Inc. assists cities and other government agencies with a broad range of services, including civil engineering, building and safety services, geotechnical engineering, financial and economic consulting, and disaster preparedness and homeland security. www.willdangroup.com SOURCE: Willdan Group Inc.
