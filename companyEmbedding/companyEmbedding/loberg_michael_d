 WOBURN, Mass. -- ArQule, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARQL) today announced that
Michael D. Loberg, Ph.D., has been named to its board of directors. Dr.
Loberg brings 27 years of senior management and drug development
experience to ArQule, including leadership positions at NitroMed, Inc.
and Bristol Myers Squibb Company.

 "Michael Loberg offers a strong combination of expertise in
product development and commercialization in international
markets," said Dr. Stephen A. Hill, president and chief executive
officer of ArQule. "He is both a scientist and an entrepreneur who
understands the field of oncology and the challenges faced by emerging
biotechnology companies as therapeutic products move from research into
clinical development and toward commercialization."

 Dr. Loberg served as president and chief executive officer of
Nitromed from 2003 to 2006, and as chief executive officer of that
company from 1997 to 2003. Previously, he served in a number of senior
management positions at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) from 1979 to 1997,
including president of the Oncology and Immunology, U.S. Primary Care,
Northern Europe, Specialty Pharmaceuticals and Squibb Diagnostics
divisions.

 Dr. Loberg is also a director of Advanced Magnetics, Inc., Kereos
and Inotek. He holds a B.S. in chemistry from Trinity College and a
Ph.D. in chemistry from Washington University.

 About ArQule

 ArQule, Inc. is a biotechnology company engaged in the research and
development of next-generation, small-molecule cancer therapeutics. The
Company's targeted, broad-spectrum products and research programs
are designed to affect key biological processes that are central to
cancer. ArQule's lead clinical-stage products have been generated
from two scientific platforms: Cancer Survival Protein modulation and
Activated Checkpoint Therapy(SM) (ACT). The Cancer Survival Protein
modulation platform has generated a clinical-stage product designed to
inhibit a molecule known as c-Met, which plays multiple roles in cancer
cell growth, survival, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. The ACT
platform is designed to kill cancer cells selectively while sparing
normal cells through direct activation of DNA damage response/checkpoint
pathways. The Company's lead ACT program, based on the E2F-1
pathway, is partnered with Roche. For more information, please visit

LEGAL TERMS

(more...)An agreement made by a couple before marriage that controls certain aspects of their relationship, usually the management and ownership of property, and sometimes whether alimony will be paid if the couple later divorces. Courts usually honor premarital agreements unless one person shows that the agreement was likely to promote divorce, was written with the intention of divorcing or was entered into unfairly. A premarital agreement may also be known as a 'prenuptial agreement.'

SEPARATIONA situation in which the partners in a married couple live apart. Spouses are said to be living apart if they no longer reside in the same dwelling, even though... (more...)A situation in which the partners in a married couple live apart. Spouses are said to be living apart if they no longer reside in the same dwelling, even though they may continue their relationship. A legal separation results when the parties separate and a court rules on the division of property, such as alimony or child support -- but does not grant a divorce.

MISREPRESENTATIONA lie by one spouse before marriage that provides grounds for an annulment. For example, if a spouse failed to mention that he was still married or was incapabl... (more...)A lie by one spouse before marriage that provides grounds for an annulment. For example, if a spouse failed to mention that he was still married or was incapable of having children, he has misrepresented himself.

(more...)A term generally meaning all your children and their children down through the generations, including grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on. Also called 'lineal descendants.'

HEAD OF HOUSEHOLDA person who supports and maintains, in one household, one or more people who are closely related to him by blood, marriage or adoption. Under federal income ta... (more...)A person who supports and maintains, in one household, one or more people who are closely related to him by blood, marriage or adoption. Under federal income tax law, you are eligible for favorable tax treatment as the head of household only if you are unmarried and you manage a household which is the principal residence (for more than half of the year) of dependent children or other dependent relatives. Under bankruptcy homestead and exemption laws, the terms householder and 'head of household' mean the same thing. Examples include a single woman supporting her disabled sister and her own children or a bachelor supporting his parents. Many states consider a single person supporting only himself to be a head of household as well.

LEGAL RISK PLACEMENTA type of adoption used by agencies to keep a child out of foster care during the adoption process. The child is placed with the adopting parents before the bir... (more...)A type of adoption used by agencies to keep a child out of foster care during the adoption process. The child is placed with the adopting parents before the birthmother has legally given up her rights to raise the child. If she then decides not to relinquish her rights, the adopting parents must give the child back. This is a risk for the adopting parents, who may lose a child to whom they've become attached.

PETITION (IMMIGRATION)A formal request for a green card or a specific nonimmigrant (temporary) visa. In many cases, the petition must be filed by someone sponsoring the immigrant, su... (more...)A formal request for a green card or a specific nonimmigrant (temporary) visa. In many cases, the petition must be filed by someone sponsoring the immigrant, such as a family member or employer. After the petition is approved, the immigrant may submit the actual visa or green card application.

(more...)Differences between spouses that are considered sufficiently severe to make married life together more or less impossible. In a number of states, irreconcilable differences is the accepted ground for a no-fault divorce. As a practical matter, courts seldom, if ever, inquire into what the differences actually are, and routinely grant a divorce as long as the party seeking the divorce says the couple has irreconcilable differences. Compare incompatibility; irremediable breakdown.

CHILD SUPPORTThe entitlement of all children to be supported by their parents until the children reach the age of majority or become emancipated -- usually by marriage, by e... (more...)The entitlement of all children to be supported by their parents until the children reach the age of majority or become emancipated -- usually by marriage, by entry into the armed forces or by living independently. Many states also impose child support obligations on parents for a year or two beyond this point if the child is a full-time student. If the parents are living separately, they each must still support the children. Typically, the parent who has custody meets his or her support obligation through taking care of the child every day, while the other parent must make payments to the custodial parent on behalf of the child -- usually cash but sometimes other kinds of contributions. When parents divorce, the court almost always orders the non-custodial parent to pay the custodial parent an amount of child support fixed by state law. Sometimes, however, if the parents share physical custody more or less equally, the court will order the higher-income parent to make payments to the lower-income parent.
