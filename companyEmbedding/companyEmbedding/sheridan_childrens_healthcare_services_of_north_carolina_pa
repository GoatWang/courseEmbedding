The Values Revolution: Embedding Empathy in the New Economy






By Ai-jen Poo










2k


























Much has been written about how our economy is changing, particularly in light of the digital revolution. This economy is defined by entirely new ways of organizing and working together, by an energizing sense of possibility, and by a seemingly insatiable thirst for problem solving.  
But a central question remains: problem-solving for and with whom? How will the new economy engage and support the least visible among us? Now that we're living in the era of tech-enabled scale and efficiency, it's time to elevate empathy and equity if we hope to shape a more caring economy that works for all of us.
These questions remind me of many of the people I meet in my work to bring recognition and basic labor protections to domestic workers around the United States. People like Erlinda, who cares for the elderly in Chicago. Erlinda became a caregiver when she arrived to this country, remembering the fulfillment of caring for the elders in her community in the Philippines. At our first meeting, she shared a story about a client she referred to as "my lady."   
They had a morning ritual.  When Erlinda arrived in the mornings, she would sing while she helped her lady out of bed and in and out of the bath to start their day. One morning, rather than ask her to sing, she asked for her hand. Erlinda knew immediately that her beloved client was preparing to say good-bye. So she quickly gathered the family together and they surrounded her in a circle of care as she passed away. Erlinda was proud that those final moments were exactly as she deserved: full of care and human connection.  
As much as she loves her work caring for others, it's a tough job. In addition to the emotional challenges associated with illness and end of life, the hours can be long and unpredictable.  The average annual median income for a home care worker in the United States is $15,000, a wage so low that many of our greatest caregivers are forced to find other work. 
And yet home care is in huge demand - it's the fastest growing occupation in the U.S. economy, a result of the aging generation and our longer lifespans.  Tech companies have emerged to help families find caregivers, and they are creating jobs in the process.  But like other parts of the new economy, the question is, will they be poverty wage jobs or jobs that acknowledge the true value of the work? 
Thankfully, we can already point to some exciting ways that business entrepreneurs and leaders are coming together with changemakers to ensure it's the latter. For example, our team at National Domestic Workers Alliance recently teamed up with Care.com, the largest tech company in the industry, to promote good work and fair standards in care work.  In June we launched a campaign, together with an employer group, Hand-in-Hand, called the Fair Care Pledge to encourage employers of caregivers and domestic workers to commit to paying fair wages and offering paid time off and a clear work agreement.  Over 40,000 individual employers have taken the pledge, and our numbers continue to grow. 
This same concept is reaching into other parts of the new economy through the Good Work Code, a simple framework for tech companies in particular to create good work for the growing numbers of people who work in the online economy.  The framework includes eight principles: safety, stability and flexibility, transparency, shared prosperity, a livable wage, inclusion and input, support and connection, growth and development.  A dozen companies took the lead in signing onto the Good Work Code when it launched last October, and a new round of companies will be announced in the coming weeks. 
Finally, in October of last year, a diverse group of leaders across business, non-profit, academia and labor signed onto a letter calling for portable benefits - a framework for benefits that allows workers to move from job to job without risking access to a basic safety net.  With increasing numbers of workers working part-time and temporary jobs, or on multiple platforms, many can no longer access the benefits and security we've long taken for granted. The concept has gained traction, with important champions in government and the tech economy. 
These advancements show what's possible in many parts of the new economy.  They also serve as an important reminder: we shape our economy as much as it shapes us.  We have an opportunity right now to make sure the digital revolution is supported by a long-overdue revolution in values - one that embeds empathy and equity more centrally in how we imagine progress and success. And one that channels the wave of innovation we are living through toward making life better for Erlinda and for all of the people whose work enriches our lives and moves our world forward.
This post is part of a "Thriving in a World of Change" series produced by The Huffington Post and Ashoka. The series is part of The Huffington Post's coverage of The World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting, and explores how, in an age of unprecedented change and connectivity, we must transition quickly to an everyone-a-contributor world with empathetic ethics at its core.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.
