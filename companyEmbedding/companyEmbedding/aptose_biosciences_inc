TRANSFORMATIONAL
Cancer Therapies
Aptose Biosciences employs a mechanism-driven approach to deliver
safer, targeted, first-in-class cancer drugs and diagnostics.








 RECENT NEWS
Aptose Biosciences Announces Results of Annual Meeting of Shareholders June 6, 2017Aptose Reports Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 May 11, 2017OHSU and Aptose Present CG’806 Preclinical Data Demonstrating Potent Activity Against Patient Samples at AACR Hematologic Malignancies Meeting May 8, 2017
 




Aptose Biosciences is a science-driven biotechnology company advancing first-in-class agents to treat life-threatening cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and other hematologic malignancies. Based on insights into the genetic and epigenetic profiles of certain cancers and patient populations, Aptose is building a pipeline of novel oncology therapies directed at dysregulated processes and signaling pathways. Aptose is developing targeted medicines for precision treatment of these diseases, based on a patient’s specific gene expression signature. In the treatment of cancer, this strategy is intended to optimize efficacy and quality of life by minimizing the cytotoxic side effects associated with conventional therapies.
CG026806 (CG’806) is a highly potent first-in-class pan-FLT3/BTK inhibitor. This small molecule therapeutic agent, exhibits a picomolar IC50 toward the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 with the Internal Tandem Duplication (FLT3-ITD) and significant potency against other mutant forms of FLT3. Because of the potency of CG’806 against the FLT3 enzyme, it may become an effective therapy for AML patients, including the subset of patients having the FLT3-ITD, which occurs in approximately 30% of patients with AML and is associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, CG’806 targets other oncogenic kinases which may also be operative in AML, thereby potentially allowing the agent to become an important therapeutic option for a difficult-to-treat patient population.
In addition to potent inhibition of wild type and mutant forms of the FLT3 enzyme, CG’806 is a highly potent, reversible, non-covalent inhibitor of the wild type and mutant forms of the BTK enzymes.  Overexpression of BTK drives certain B cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and others.  Treatment of such B cell malignancies with covalent BTK inhibitors that target the cysteine residue in the active site of BTK can lead to drug resistance via mutation of the cysteine amino acid residue to a serine residue (BTK-C481S mutant). CG’806 targets the ATP-binding pocket of BTK through a reversible, non-covalent mechanism, thereby allowing CG’806 to retain low nM potency against the BTK-C481S mutant enzyme. Thus, CG’806 may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to treat B cell malignancy patients that are refractory, resistant or intolerant to covalent BTK inhibitors.
APTO-253, the Company’s second program, is a small molecule therapeutic agent that inhibits expression of the c-Myc oncogene without causing general myelosuppression of the bone marrow. The c-Myc oncogene is overexpressed in hematologic cancers, including AML. C-Myc is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and overexpression amplifies new sets of genes to promote oncogenesis. APTO-253 dramatically downregulates expression of the c-Myc oncogene in AML cells and depletes those cells of the c-Myc oncoprotein, leading to apoptotic cell death in AML cells. Thus APTO-253 may serve as safe and effective c-Myc inhibitor for AML that combines well with other agents and does not impact the normal bone marrow.

AML





































AML 







AML Overview
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer derived from myeloid progenitor or stem cells that typically mature into red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets.  AML initiates in the bone marrow when stem or progenitor cells lose cell cycle control, anti-apoptotic factor or other means to limit rampant proliferations.  Leukemic cells have the ability to rapidly spread from the marrow to the bloodstream.  Further, these rapidly proliferating cells quickly crowd out normal cells as they infiltrate other organs and tissue systems.

The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society estimates prevalence for AML of 35,726 as of January 1, 2010, and the American Cancer Society projects new AML diagnoses of 18,860 patients and deaths of 10,460 in 2014.  Elderly patients are disproportionately impacted by AML, at rates four times more prevalent in patients over 60 years of age, with an incidence rate of 1 / 1020, whereas individuals under age 60 years have an incidence rate of approximately 1 / 4500.

The current standard of care in patients with AML is chemotherapy with cytarabine, infused over seven days continuously, and daunorubicin, infused over three days, hence known as the “7+3” regimen.  The therapy is known to have significant side effects and, as a result, many patients are deemed to be ineligible.  A recent survey of key opinion leaders by Datamonitor reported that of patients over the age of 60, only 28 percent are placed on an induction chemotherapy regimen, while 51 percent are enrolled in a clinical trial and 21 percent are provided best supportive care only.  The lack of a tolerable regimen for a significant proportion of patients with AML constitutes the immense need for new therapies.











CG’806




































CG’806 







Introduction
CG’806 is a highly potent, non-covalent small molecule therapeutic agent, exhibiting a picomolar IC50 toward the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 with the Internal Tandem Duplication (FLT3-ITD and single-digit nanomolar IC50’s against Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and its C481S mutant (BTK-C481S)). Further, CG’806 is a multi-targeted BTK / FLT3-ITD inhibitor as it impacts other relevant oncogenic targets, including the Aurora kinases (AURK), RET, MET, DDR2, and SRC kinases.
As a potent inhibitor of FLT3-ITD and other mutant forms of FLT3, CG’806 may become an effective therapy in this subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. FLT3-ITD occurs in approximately 30% of patients with AML. Importantly, CG’806 targets other oncogenic kinases which may also be operative in FLT3-ITD AML, thereby potentially allowing the agent to become an important therapeutic option for a difficult-to-treat patient population.
The C481S mutation of BTK arises from therapy with covalent, irreversible BTK inhibitors that target the active site cysteine residue of BTK, thereby conferring resistance to other covalent BTK inhibitors. As a non-covalent, reversible inhibitor, CG’806 does not rely on the cysteine 481 residue (Cys481) for binding in the active site of BTK. Consequently, patients relapsed or refractory to other commercially approved or development stage BTK inhibitors with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) may continue to be sensitive to CG’806 therapy.
Role of BTK in B-cell signaling
BTK, a member of the TEC family kinase, is an essential element of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which is required for B-cell maturation, survival and proliferation. It is an upstream activator of multiple pro-survival / anti-apoptotic pathways, including the NF-KB, mTOR-AKT and ERK pathways. BTK is overexpressed in malignant cells from patients with various B-cell malignancies, such as CLL, MCL, AML, and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Disruption of BCR signaling via inhibition of BTK, has been shown to lead to clinical remissions in these patients.
CG’806 as a non-covalent, reversible kinase inhibitor
Binding studies of CG’806 have confirmed non-covalent, reversible inhibition of BTK, FLT3-ITD and Aurora Kinase A. Commercially-approved, covalent BTK inhibitors possess a Michael acceptor to react with Cys481 in BTK and irreversibly inactivate the BTK enzyme. In contrast, CG’806 does not require reactivity with the Cys481 residue for inhibition of the BTK enzyme, thereby allowing CG’806 to inhibit the wild type and Cys481 mutant form of the BTK enzyme.
Preclinical In Vitro Evaluation of CG’806
CG’806 is a potent inhibitor of BTK and FLT3 wild types, as well as the BTK C481S and FLT3-ITD mutants, which represent major sources of therapy relapse or are negative prognostic signals in patients. In enzymatic assays, CG’806 has demonstrated best-in class potency against the BTK C481S mutant with an IC50 of 2.5 nM. CG’806 also has potent activity against the FLT-ITD mutation, occurring in 30-35% of AML patients, with an IC50 against the purified enzyme of 0.8 nM (800pM). Similarly, CG’806 demonstrated picomolar potency against Aurora A (IC50 0.4 nM). Notably, CG’806 is a potent inhibitor of interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), at approximately 4 nM.  ITK is speculated to play a role in suppressing activated T-cell function, hence inhibition of ITK alleviates this suppression, and provide for a potential immunomodulatory anti-tumor mechanism.  Finally, CG’806 does not exhibit any inhibition of EGFR. EGFR inhibition has been speculated to contribute to the toxicity observed from the commercially approved BTK inhibitor.
BTK is overexpressed in the blast cells of approximately 80% of AML patients as compared to normal PBMCs in healthy subjects. Researchers have shown that BTK inhibition attenuates the proliferation and survival of FLT3-ITD primary AML blasts and AML cell lines, as well as inhibits the downstream activation FLT3-ITD-dependent Myc and STAT5 kinases. CG’806 is the only drug in development that inhibits both FLT3-ITD and BTK pathways reported to synergize to drive the proliferation and survival of AML.
Xenograft studies
In vivo subcutaneous AML tumor models of anti-cancer efficacy revealed CG’806 induced rapid and sustained tumor eradication (Figure 1). CG’806 was administered orally once daily, for 14 days. Moreover, CG’806 exhibited the sustained tumor elimination post therapy, while demonstrating no impact to murine body weight, no impacts to hematology cell counts or visible organ toxicities – necropsy and clinical pathology findings did not reveal any abnormal observations. A maximum tolerated dose has not yet been identified with murine xenograft studies, having been performed up to 450 mg/kg orally for 14 days (CrystalGenomics preliminary toxicity data).

Figure 1. Efficacy of CG’806 in MV4-11 xenograft model.
MV4-11 tumor bearing mice were administered an oral suspension once daily for 14 days of CG’806 at 2 mg/kg (blue line), 10 mg/kg (green line) or 100 mg/kg (red line), Ibrutinib, 12 mg/kg (turquoise line), or vehicle (Control; black line) with 7-day post-treatment follow-up. Tumor volumes and body weights were measured 3 times weekly.
Intellectual Property
A PCT application providing composition of matter and use protection for CG’806 was filed in late-2013, with a potential expiry in 2033 before extension opportunities, across all major geographies.
Status
CG’806 is currently in IND-enabling studies and Aptose expects to file an IND for a first-in-human clinical trial by late-2017. CG’806 is being developed as a once-daily, oral therapeutic.

Aptose Biosciences Inc. (Aptose) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The Company is engaged in the development of anticancer drugs that target specific epigenetic processes and signal transduction abnormalities that underlie a particular life-threatening malignancy. Its product pipeline includes cancer drug candidates that exert activity as stand-alone agents and that enhance the activities of other anticancer agents without causing overlapping toxicities. The Company develops therapeutics focused on epigenetic processes and signal transduction abnormalities at the edge of cancer research, coupled with companion diagnostics to identify the optimal patient population for its products. The Company's APTO-253 is a small molecule that can induce expression of the genes that codes for the Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) master transcription factor and the p21 cell cycle inhibitor protein.

					Full Description



Aptose Biosciences Inc. (Aptose), incorporated on November 1, 2006, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The Company is engaged in the development of anticancer drugs that target specific epigenetic processes and signal transduction abnormalities that underlie a particular life-threatening malignancy. The Company's product pipeline includes cancer drug candidates that exert activity as stand-alone agents and that enhance the activities of other anticancer agents without causing overlapping toxicities. The Company develops therapeutics focused on epigenetic processes and signal transduction abnormalities at the edge of cancer research, coupled with companion diagnostics to identify the optimal patient population for its products.The Company's APTO-253 is a small molecule that can induce expression of the genes that codes for the Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) master transcription factor and the p21 cell cycle inhibitor protein, and can inhibit expression of the c-Myc oncogene, leading to cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death (apoptosis) in human-derived solid tumor and hematologic cancer cells. In nonclinical pharmacology studies, APTO-253 demonstrates in vivo anti-tumor activity against xenograft models of solid tumors and hematologic cancers, with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells exhibiting a particular sensitivity to APTO-253. APTO-253 has demonstrated potent and selective in vitro antiproliferative activity against a variety of leukemia cell lines, including AML, ALL and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 0.007 to 0.3 micrometer (uM).The Company's Small molecule program is focused on investigating series of Aptose compounds for veterinary medicine. The Company has agreement with Moffitt Cancer Center for global rights to multi-targeting, single-agent inhibitors for the treatment of hematologic and solid tumor cancers. The small molecule agents are highly differentiated inhibitors of the Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal motif (BET) protein family members, which target specific kinase enzymes. The molecules developed by Moffitt exhibit nanomolar potency against the BET family members and specific oncogenic kinases which, when inhibited, are synergistic with BET inhibition. Under the agreement, the Company has access to the drug candidates developed by Moffitt and the underlying intellectual property covering the chemical modifications enabling potent bromodomain (BRD) inhibition on the chemical backbone of a kinase inhibitor. The Company also has drug discovery partnership with Laxai Avanti Life Sciences (LALS) for the expertise in next generation epigenetic-based therapies. Under the agreement, LALS is responsible for developing multiple clinical candidates, including optimizing candidates derived from Aptose's relationship with the Moffitt Cancer Center.

Aptose Biosciences





































TRANSFORMATIONAL
Cancer Therapies
Aptose Biosciences employs a mechanism-driven approach to deliver
safer, targeted, first-in-class cancer drugs and diagnostics.








 RECENT NEWS
Aptose Biosciences Announces Results of Annual Meeting of Shareholders June 6, 2017Aptose Reports Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 May 11, 2017OHSU and Aptose Present CG’806 Preclinical Data Demonstrating Potent Activity Against Patient Samples at AACR Hematologic Malignancies Meeting May 8, 2017
 




Aptose Biosciences is a science-driven biotechnology company advancing first-in-class agents to treat life-threatening cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and other hematologic malignancies. Based on insights into the genetic and epigenetic profiles of certain cancers and patient populations, Aptose is building a pipeline of novel oncology therapies directed at dysregulated processes and signaling pathways. Aptose is developing targeted medicines for precision treatment of these diseases, based on a patient’s specific gene expression signature. In the treatment of cancer, this strategy is intended to optimize efficacy and quality of life by minimizing the cytotoxic side effects associated with conventional therapies.
CG026806 (CG’806) is a highly potent first-in-class pan-FLT3/BTK inhibitor. This small molecule therapeutic agent, exhibits a picomolar IC50 toward the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 with the Internal Tandem Duplication (FLT3-ITD) and significant potency against other mutant forms of FLT3. Because of the potency of CG’806 against the FLT3 enzyme, it may become an effective therapy for AML patients, including the subset of patients having the FLT3-ITD, which occurs in approximately 30% of patients with AML and is associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, CG’806 targets other oncogenic kinases which may also be operative in AML, thereby potentially allowing the agent to become an important therapeutic option for a difficult-to-treat patient population.
In addition to potent inhibition of wild type and mutant forms of the FLT3 enzyme, CG’806 is a highly potent, reversible, non-covalent inhibitor of the wild type and mutant forms of the BTK enzymes.  Overexpression of BTK drives certain B cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and others.  Treatment of such B cell malignancies with covalent BTK inhibitors that target the cysteine residue in the active site of BTK can lead to drug resistance via mutation of the cysteine amino acid residue to a serine residue (BTK-C481S mutant). CG’806 targets the ATP-binding pocket of BTK through a reversible, non-covalent mechanism, thereby allowing CG’806 to retain low nM potency against the BTK-C481S mutant enzyme. Thus, CG’806 may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to treat B cell malignancy patients that are refractory, resistant or intolerant to covalent BTK inhibitors.
APTO-253, the Company’s second program, is a small molecule therapeutic agent that inhibits expression of the c-Myc oncogene without causing general myelosuppression of the bone marrow. The c-Myc oncogene is overexpressed in hematologic cancers, including AML. C-Myc is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and overexpression amplifies new sets of genes to promote oncogenesis. APTO-253 dramatically downregulates expression of the c-Myc oncogene in AML cells and depletes those cells of the c-Myc oncoprotein, leading to apoptotic cell death in AML cells. Thus APTO-253 may serve as safe and effective c-Myc inhibitor for AML that combines well with other agents and does not impact the normal bone marrow.
Aptose’s leadership team comprises accomplished industry, financial and clinical research professionals who are dedicated to building a comprehensive anticancer drug pipeline and clinical development programs focused on targeted therapeutics directed against dysregulated oncogenic processes in patients with life-threatening hematologic malignancies.
