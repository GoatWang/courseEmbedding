Response:
A. Introduction
EDGA Exchange, Inc. ("Exchange") proposes to register as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). The Exchange will be wholly owned by its parent company, Direct Edge Holdings LLC, which will elect all directors of the Board of Directors of the Exchange, including those directors nominated by members of the Exchange and those directors nominated by members of Direct Edge Holdings LLC holding at least fifteen percent (15%) of the membership interests of Direct Edge Holdings LLC, in each case pursuant to Article III, Section 4 of the By-Laws of the Exchange. The members of the Exchange ("Members") will consist of those broker-dealers admitted to membership and entitled to enter orders in, and receive executions through, the Exchange's order book (as defined below) or otherwise. Members will be subject to the rules of the Exchange, and will have representation on the Exchange's Board of Directors and certain committees. Once registered, the Exchange will operate a fully automated electronic book ("order book") for orders to buy or sell securities ("orders") with a continuous, automated matching function. Liquidity will be derived from orders to buy and orders to sell submitted to the Exchange electronically by its Members from remote locations. There will be no Exchange trading floor, nor will there be Exchange specialists or market makers with affirmative and negative market making obligations.
Membership in the Exchange will be open to any broker-dealer registered under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act that meets the standards for membership set forth in proposed Exchange Rules 2.3 through 2.5. There will only be one class of membership, with all Members enjoying the same rights and privileges on the Exchange. Members will be subject to fees for orders executed on the Exchange as set forth in the Rules of the Exchange or as may otherwise be determined by the Board of Directors of the Exchange from time-to-time. Exchange memberships will not be transferable except in the event of a change in control of a Member, and such transfer will be subject to the written consent of the Exchange, and to any conditions to such transfers imposed by the Exchange. The Exchange currently does not contemplate charging a fee for membership in the Exchange. A more detailed description of the membership criteria is set forth in Chapter II of the Exchange's proposed rules. See Exhibit B, supra.
This exhibit describes, in summary form, the proposed operation of the Exchange. A more detailed description of the proposed Exchange is set forth in the proposed By-Laws and Rules of the Exchange. See Exhibits A and B to this Application.
B. Access to the Exchange (#1)
Member Access. Members of the Exchange and/or Service Bureaus on behalf of a Member (collectively referred to as "Access Participants" for purposes of this paragraph B) will be permitted to send orders to buy and sell securities listed or traded on the Exchange to the Exchange electronically through the use of a variety of systems. The Exchange will not accept telephone orders.
The Exchange has designed its systems to allow its Members to individually determine the best method for accessing the Exchange. Thus, Members may develop their own customized front-end software using protocols determined by the Exchange, or may use third-party vendors to route orders to the Exchange via a front end or service bureau configuration. Access Participants will be able to access the Exchange remotely through a variety of methods and connections that support a minimum data exchange rate, as may be determined by the Exchange from time-to-time.
Direct access to the Exchange is available to Access Participants at an Internet Protocol ("IP") address by one or more of the following methods: (i) electronic access at the Exchange's IP network address by the Access Participant's own software, via communications that are compliant with the Financial Information Exchange ("FIX") protocol application programmer interface ("API") provided by the Exchange; (ii) electronic access at the IP network address maintained by the Exchange by the Access Participant's own software that is compliant with the API provided by the Exchange; or (iii) other means of access provided from time to time by the Exchange.
Access Participants provide a unique IP address the Exchange for each requested connection, and the Exchange then configures its routers to only allow access from the Access Participant's IP address to a dedicated IP address on the Exchange's order handling network. In this way, only authorized Access Participants can gain access to EDGA via registered physical IP addresses.
Access Participants will be responsible for having procedures reasonably designed for safeguarding access to the Exchange and for notifying the Exchange upon learning that such safeguards have been compromised. Connectivity to the Exchange will occur through secure telecommunications "ports" or points of entry. Specifically, each Access Participant will be assigned a specific port, or multiple ports, each of which has a unique session identification code provided only to such Access Participant.
Non-Member Access. As necessary, the Exchange will have and maintain connectivity to the other national securities exchanges and Market Centers (such term is defined in Rule 600(b)(35) of Regulation NMS) for the purposes of receiving inbound orders. The Exchange plans to become a participant in the NASDAQ/National Market System/Unlisted Trading Privileges Plan ("Nasdaq-UTP Plan"). The Exchange proposes to discuss with the Nasdaq-UTP Plan operating committee, how the Exchange might best participate in such Plans. If admitted as a participant in the Nasdaq-UTP Plan, other plan participants would be able to send orders to the Exchange in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan as they ultimately would be applied to the Exchange.
Non-members also may access the Exchange pursuant to Exchange rules governing "sponsored access" to the Exchange, as described below.
Sponsored Participant Access to the Exchange. The Exchange plans to permit access to the Exchange to entities ("Sponsored Participants") whose access is authorized in advance by one or more members ("Sponsoring Member") in accordance with Exchange Rules. The Sponsoring Member must agree to be responsible for all orders entered into on the Exchange by the Sponsored Participant. In addition, Sponsored Participants must agree to comply with all applicable Rules of the Exchange governing the entry, execution, reporting, clearing and settling of orders in securities eligible for trading on the Exchange.
C. Entry and Display of Quotations and Orders in the System (#2)
Entry of Orders on the Exchange. The Exchange will accept the submission of orders by Exchange Members in securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges ("UTP") on the Exchange. The Exchange will not list securities initially, though it may do so in the future. Accordingly, while this Application, including certain rules included in Exhibit B, contains references to securities listed or trading pursuant to UTP, the reference to securities listed on the Exchange is intended to be read prospectively.
Orders entered into EDGA Exchange must be priced and must have a designated size ("limit orders") or must be orders to buy or sell a stated amount of a security at the national best bid or offer when the order reaches the Exchange ("market orders"). Limit orders and market orders, as defined above, are hereinafter collectively referred to as "orders".
Orders will be accepted for any such security, whether submitted by a Member on a proprietary or agency basis, in any size up to 999,999 shares. Orders may be submitted in round lots or odd lots. To reduce the possibility of the entry of erroneously large orders, the Exchange will provide Members with the ability to establish parameters as to the maximum number of shares that can be entered on their behalf or on behalf of their clients in any given order.
Members may submit the following orders to the Exchange: IOC; Day; Good 'til Cancel; Good 'til Day; Reserve; Odd Lot; Mixed Lot; EDGA Only; EDGA Post Only; Pegged; Mid-Point Peg; Non-Displayed; Destination Specific; Destination-on-Open Step Up Order and Intermarket Sweep. Each of these types of orders is described in detail in proposed Exchange Rule 11.5. Members will also be permitted to enter short sales, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation SHO of the Exchange Act. The Exchange will maintain a full audit trail of every order submitted to the Exchange's System. Members may receive status reports regarding orders submitted to the Exchange or change or cancel an order at any time before that order is executed on the Exchange. Based on Exchange system functionality, a locked or crossed market will not be displayed by the Exchange with respect to orders to buy and orders to sell submitted to the Exchange.
All securities will be traded in decimals on the Exchange. Bids, offers, orders or indications of interests in securities traded on the Exchange will not be made in an increment smaller than: (1) $0.01 if those bids, offers or indications of interests are priced equal to or greater than $1.00 per share; or (2) $0.0001 if those bids, offers or indications of interests are priced less than $1.00 per share and the security is an NMS stock pursuant to Commission Rule 600(b)(46) and is trading on the Exchange; or (3) any other increment established by the Commission for any security which has been granted an exemption from the minimum price increment requirements of Commission Rule 612(a) or 612(b).
Display of Orders. All orders submitted to the Exchange will be displayed unless designated otherwise by the Member submitting the order ("non-displayed orders"). Orders submitted to the Exchange for display shall be displayed on an anonymous basis at the price specified by the Member submitting the order. Non-displayed orders will not be displayed to any Member of the Exchange and will not have time priority over displayed orders. In addition, the Exchange intends to become a participant in the Consolidated Quotation Plan ("CQ Plan") and Nasdaq-UTP Plan and will collect and submit to the relevant plan processor the best buy order and the best sell order displayed on the Exchange in Eligible Securities, as defined in these Plans, in accordance with the terms of the Plans.
Finally, to enhance transparency throughout the market, the Exchange intends to make its order book for any security traded on the Exchange available for viewing by any member of the public through the Exchange's web site.
D. Order Routing to other Market Centers
Members may enter into agreements to use the routing services of an affiliated broker-dealer of the Exchange, which will enable Members to route to other market centers the unexecuted portions of designated Routable Orders entered on the Exchange. In this capacity, the affiliated broker-dealer will act as an agent of the Member. See Exhibit C and proposed Exchange Rule 2.11 and Rule 2.12 for further details regarding the affiliated router. Members will have no obligation, however, to utilize the order routing functionality provided by the Exchange's broker-dealer affiliate. Accordingly, Members can select other broker-dealers to provide order-routing functions or use their own internal order-routing systems.
E. Execution, Reporting, Clearance and Settlement Procedures (#3)
Execution of Orders Submitted to Exchange's order book. Trades will occur when an order to buy and an order to sell match on the Exchange's order book. An order to buy submitted to the Exchange's order book will be automatically executed by the Exchange's order book to the extent that it is priced at an amount that equals or exceeds any order to sell for the same security submitted to the Exchange's order book. Such order to buy shall be executed at the price of the lowest-priced order to sell having precedence on the Exchange's order book, except where such sell order(s) are non-displayed and/or odd-lot orders not currently being displayed by the System, and such sell orders are priced below the National Best Offer ("NBO"). In such circumstances, such order to buy shall be executed at the price(s) equal to the greater of: (a) the mid-point between the price of the order to buy and the price(s) of the best-priced order(s) to sell having priority in the EDGA Book; and (b) the National Best Bid ("NBB"). Where such buy order is priced above the then-current NBO, it shall be ex
ecuted at the price(s) equal to the greater of: (a) the mid-point between the price of the then-current NBO and the price(s) of the best-priced order(s) to sell having priority in the EDGA Book; and (b) the NBB.
An order to sell submitted to the Exchange's order book will be automatically executed by the Exchange's order book to the extent that it is priced at an amount that equals or is less than any order to buy for the same security submitted to the Exchange's order book. Such order to sell shall be executed at the price of the highest-priced order to buy having precedence on the Exchange's order book, except where such buy order(s) are non-displayed and/or odd-lot orders not currently being displayed by the System, and such buy orders are priced above the National Best Bid. In such circumstances, such order to sell shall be executed at the price(s) equal to the lesser of: (a) the mid-point between the price of the order to sell and the price(s) of the best-priced order(s) to buy having priority in the EDGA Book; and (b) the NBO. Where such sell order is priced below the then-current NBB, it shall be executed at the price(s) equal to the lesser of: (a) the mid-point between the price of the then-current NBB and the price(s) of the best-priced order(s) to buy having priority in the EDGA Book; and (b) the NBO.
All orders are matched according to price-display-time priority. Proposed Rule 11.8 describes the priority given to orders at the same price. Non-displayed orders will have priority over orders at inferior prices, whether displayed or non-displayed, but will not have priority or time precedence over orders displayed at equal or superior prices. In the event that less than the full size of an order is executed, whether displayed or non-displayed, the unexecuted size of the order will continue to reside on the Exchange's order book, and if displayed, will be redisplayed at such price.
In executing orders submitted to the Exchange's order book, the Exchange will not distinguish between orders submitted by Members for their own accounts and orders submitted by Members for their customers. Unlike exchanges that conduct trading via a physical trading floor, all Exchange Members will submit orders to the Exchange from remote locations and have equal access to orders residing on the Exchange. Similarly, because orders on the Exchange will be executed automatically, no Member of the Exchange will have the ability to control the timing of execution (other than to change or cancel an order prior to execution) or otherwise enjoy the type of special order handling advantages that may be available on the physical floor of an exchange. Moreover, as noted above, non-Members will have access to the display of orders on the Exchange's order book through the Exchange's web site.
Exchange Rule 11.13 will permit the Exchange to address those instances in which transactions occurring on the Exchange involve obvious errors ("Clearly Erroneous Policy"). Under the Clearly Erroneous Policy, Members receiving an execution based on the entry of a buy or sell order that clearly was in error - in terms of price, quantity, or identification of the proper symbol for a security - will be permitted to request that the Exchange void or modify the transaction. Designated Exchange officials will review the transaction to determine whether, in fact, the transaction was clearly erroneous. If such officials determine that a trade is clearly erroneous, they shall void or modify the terms of the trade to achieve an equitable rectification of the error. A Member may appeal the initial decision by Exchange officials to the Clearly Erroneous Execution Panel, which will be comprised of the CRO, or a designee of the CRO, and representatives from two (2) Members. An officer of the Exchange also will have the authority, on his or her own motion, to review and declare null and void, or otherwise modify the terms of, transactions arising out of the use of the Exchange's order book during a period of disruption or malfunction, or in the event of extraordinary market conditions or other circumstances in which the nullification or modification of transactions may be necessary for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market or the protection of investors and the public interest.
Trade Reporting. The Exchange intends to become a participant in the Consolidated Tape Association Plan ("CTA Plan") and will report trades in Eligible Securities (as defined in the CTA Plan) pursuant to the terms of the plan. Similarly, the Exchange expects to join the Nasdaq-UTP Plan and will report trades in Nasdaq securities traded on the Exchange that have been admitted to unlisted traded privileges pursuant to the provisions of that plan.
Clearance and Settlement of Exchange Trades. The Exchange will require each Member to be a member of a registered clearing agency or clear its transactions through a Member that is a member of a registered clearing agency.
F. Exchange Fees (#4)
Fees Generally. The Exchange currently does not propose to charge a fee for Exchange membership. The Exchange may, in the future, however, prescribe such reasonable dues, fees, and assessments or other charges as it may deem appropriate. Similarly, where there is no existing, matching, contra-side buy or sell order residing on the Exchange, Members entering orders on the Exchange's order book will not be assessed a fee. Instead, Members entering orders under such circumstances will receive a credit from the Exchange for orders entered and later executed on the Exchange. There will not be a fee charged for changing or canceling an order prior to execution of such order. Exchange Members submitting buy or sell orders that execute against existing, matching, contra-side orders already residing on the Exchange will be charged a per share fee, payable to the Exchange on a monthly basis. The Exchange may also charge a connectivity fee based on the number of ports utilized by the Member. Exchange Members will be solely responsible for all telecommunications costs and all other expenses incurred in linking to, and maintaining links to, the Exchange. The Exchange may determine to revise or impose different fees upon its Members from time-to-time.
G. Procedures for Ensuring Compliance with Exchange Usage Guidelines (#5)
The Exchange System contains embedded Member order entry and trade guidelines. All data representing a Member's order must comply with these guidelines. Members cannot override these embedded guidelines. With respect to technical standards, prior to allowing a new Member to begin trading, the Exchange and the Member will thoroughly test the Member's connectivity. In addition, the Member may enter orders in test securities to ensure compatibility with the Exchange's system protocol. A Member may begin trading only after the Exchange is satisfied that both the Member's hardware and software meet the Exchange's standards.
Members also must agree to maintain an adequate connection to the Exchange as defined from time-to-time by the Exchange that includes a connection of sufficient speed and equipment of minimum quality.
H. Hours of Operation and Proposed Commencement of the Exchange (#6)
The Exchange proposes to operate Monday to Friday from 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, or during any other day or time approved by the Board of Directors of the Exchange.
The Exchange proposes to commence operations upon the Commission's approval of its Form 1 Application for Registration as a National Securities Exchange.
I. Exchange Users Manual (#7)
As discussed above, Members will be provided with the Exchange's technical specifications, which will enable them to develop or purchase their own, customized front-end software for interfacing with the Exchange. Members also may use third-party vendors to route orders to the Exchange via a front end or service bureau configuration. At a time closer to its initial operation as an exchange, the Exchange will file a draft Users Manual that will be provided to all Members and prospective Members of the Exchange. The Users Manual will describe the Exchange's technical specifications and will provide Members, prospective Members and other users of the Exchange with additional information that the Exchange believes will be useful to such persons for trading on the Exchange.
J. Possession of Funds or Securities (#8)
The Exchange will not hold funds or securities of its Members.

Exhibit L
Exhibit Request:

Response:
Membership on the Exchange will be open to any registered broker or dealer or any natural person associated with a registered broker or dealer. Any person may become an associated person of a Member of the Exchange. Exchange Members will be entitled to enter and view orders to buy and sell securities listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on the Exchange in accordance with Exchange Rules.
To become a Member of the Exchange, or continue as a Member of the Exchange, a person: (1) if other than a natural person, must be a registered broker or dealer, (2) if a natural person, must be either a registered broker or dealer or associated with a registered broker or dealer, (3) must be a member of another self-regulatory organization, (4) must either be a member of a registered clearing agency qualified by the Exchange or clear transactions through a member of such a qualified clearing agency, (5) must not be subject to a statutory disqualification (except pursuant to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission permitting such membership), (6) must meet the standards of training, experience and competence as the exchange may prescribe, (7) must comply with Rule 15c3-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), and other financial responsibility and operational capability requirements that may be established by the Exchange, (8) must be able to comply with the rules of the Exchange, including rules related to the maintenance of appropriate books and records, (9) must be able to demonstrate adequate systems capability, capacity, integrity and security, (10) must not be subject to unsatisfied material liens, judgments, and claims, (11) must not have been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or arrangement for the benefit of creditors within a three year period, (12) must not have established a pattern of failure to pay just debts or defaulted, without reasonable explanation, on an obligation to another self-regulatory organization or member thereof, and (13) must not have engaged in acts or practices inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. Members may be suspended for failure to pay Exchange dues, fees and assessments, or if they have been expelled or suspended from membership, or association in another self-regulatory organization.
Applicants for membership on the Exchange will be required to complete a membership application agreeing, among other things, to comply with the By-Laws, Rules and interpretations of the Exchange. Existing members of SROs that are also current or former subscribers to the electronic communications network operated by Direct Edge ECN LLC will, for a short time after the commencement of trading on the Exchange, be permitted to submit a short-form waive-in membership application form. Membership applications will be reviewed by the Exchange staff. Denials of membership by the staff may be appealed pursuant to the Adverse Action procedures set forth in Chapter X of the Exchange's proposed Rules.
The Exchange may revoke the membership of a Member or an associated person whenever it has reason to believe that such Member fails to meet the membership qualification requirements of the Exchange.
Persons subject to suspension or termination with regard to access to the Exchange will be afforded an opportunity to be heard under Exchange Rules governing adverse actions. Persons applying for a hearing pursuant to these rules will be required to do so within 15 business days after being notified of such action. Applicants are permitted to submit any additional documents, statements, arguments or other materials in support of their application. Hearings will be held by the Appeals Committee, which will render its decision on the matter in writing. Decisions of the Appeals Committee will be subject to review by the Board of Directors of the Exchange either on its own motion or upon the written request of an applicant. The Board may affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, the decision of the Appeals Committee.
A more detailed description of the Exchange's Adverse Actions procedure is set forth in Chapter X of the Exchange's proposed rules.
It is the Exchange's intention to enter into regulatory services agreements with the ISE LLC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") to conduct various regulatory services on behalf of the Exchange. In addition, it is the Exchange's intention to file with the Commission a plan setting forth the allocation of certain regulatory responsibilities between itself and one or more other self-regulatory organizations pursuant to Rule 17d-2 of the Exchange Act.

Exhibit M
Exhibit Request:
Provide an alphabetical list of all members, participants, subscribers or other users, including the following information:

Name,
Date of election to membership or acceptance as a participant, subscriber or other user,
Principal business address and telephone number,
If member, participant, subscriber or other user is an individual, the name of the entity with which such individual is associated and the relationship of such individual to the entity (e.g., partner, officer, director, employee, etc.),
Describe the type of activities primarily engaged in by the member, participant, subscriber, or other user (e.g., floor broker, specialist, odd lot dealer, other market maker, proprietary trader, non-broker dealer, inactive or other functions). A person shall be "primarily engaged" in an activity or function for purposes of this item when that activity or function is the one in which that person is engaged for the majority of their time. When more than one type of person at an entity engages in any of the six types of activities or functions enumerated in this item, identify each type (e.g., proprietary trader, Registered Competitive Trader and Registered Competitive Market Maker) and state the number of members, participants, subscribers, or other users in each, and
The class of membership, participation or subscription or other access.

Response:
EDGA Exchange has not commenced operations and currently has no Members.

Exhibit N
Exhibit Request: Provide a schedule for each of the following:

The securities listed in the exchange, indicating for each the name of the issuer and a description of the security;
The securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges, indicating for each the name of the issuer and a description of the security;
The unregistered securities admitted to trading on the exchange which are exempt from registration under Section 12(a) of the Act. For each security listed, provide the name of the issuer and a description of the security, and the statutory exemption claimed (e.g., Rule 12a-6); and
Other securities traded on the exchange, including for each the name of the issuer and a description of the security.

Response:
EDGA Exchange has not commenced operations and, therefore, it has no securities that are listed or traded pursuant to unlisted trading privileges. As explained in Exhibit E, the Exchange will not list securities initially, though it may do so in the future.
EDGA Exchange represents that the Exchange's surveillance procedures for derivative securities products traded on the Exchange pursuant to unlisted trading privileges will be similar to the procedures used for equity securities traded on the Exchange and will incorporate and rely upon existing Exchange surveillance systems. The Exchange will closely monitor activity in derivative securities products traded on the Exchange pursuant to unlisted trading privileges to deter any improper trading activity. The Exchange will enter into a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement ("CSSA") with a market trading components of the index or portfolio on which the derivative securities product is based to the same extent as the listed exchange's rule require the listing market to enter into a CSSA with such market.
Upon the effectiveness of its Form 1 Application for Registration as a National Securities Exchange, the Exchange intends to allow trading of Nasdaq National Market and Nasdaq Capital Market securities (both "Nasdaq securities" as defined in Rule 600(b)(41) of Regulation NMS) through EDGA Exchange. EDGA Exchange also plans to allow trading of exchange-traded securities, as defined in Rule 600(b)(25) of Regulation NMS, including exchange-traded funds or ETFs, through EDGA Exchange. All securities that EDGA Exchange will trade through the EDGA Exchange System are "NMS stocks", as such term is defined in Rule 600(b)(47) of Regulation NMS, and will be, at least initially, admitted pursuant to unlisted trading privileges.

1  The term "Facilities" in Item 4 references underlying infrastructure for the operation of exchanges and the ATS owned by Direct Edge Holdings, Inc. and is not intended to refer to the statutory definition of "facility" as set forth in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        August 17, 2015.
        Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”),[1] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2] 
           notice is hereby given that on August 7, 2015, EDGA Exchange, Inc. (the “Exchange” or “EDGA”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Exchange has designated this proposal as a “non-controversial” proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act [3] 
           and Rule 19b-4(f)(6)(iii) Start Printed Page 50882thereunder,[4] 
           which renders it effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
The Exchange filed a proposal to amend Rule 13.8 to describe a market data product known as EDGA Book Viewer.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Exchange's Web site at www.batstrading.com, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
1. Purpose
The Exchange proposes to add language to Rule 13.8 describing a market data product known as EDGA Book Viewer. The proposal memorializes in the Exchange's rules a data feed that is currently available through the Exchange's public Web site free of charge. EDGA Book Viewer is a data feed that disseminates, on a real-time basis, the aggregated two-side quotations for up to five (5) price levels for all displayed orders for securities traded on the Exchange and for which the Exchanges reports quotes under the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. EDGA Book Viewer also contains the last ten (10) trades including time of trade, price and share quantity. EDGA Book Viewer is currently available via www.batstrading.com without charge. The Exchange will file a separate proposed rule change with the Commission proposing fees to be charged for certain types of access to EDGA Book Viewer as of September 1, 2015.[5] 

2. Statutory Basis
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act,[6] 
           in general, and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act,[7] 
           in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and to protect investors and the public interest, and that it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or dealers. This proposal is in keeping with those principles in that it promotes increased transparency through the dissemination of EDGA Book Viewer. The Exchange also believes this proposal is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act because it protects investors and the public interest and promotes just and equitable principles of trade by providing investors with an alternative for receiving market data as requested by market data vendors and purchasers that expressed an interest in exchange-only data for instances where consolidated data is no longer required to be purchased and displayed. The proposed rule change would benefit investors by facilitating their prompt access to real-time depth-of-book information contained in EDGA Book Viewer. The proposed rule change also removes impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system by memorializing in the Exchange's rules a data feed that is currently available through the Exchange's public Web site free of charge.
The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 11(A) of the Act [8] 
           in that it supports (i) fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and (ii) the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities. Furthermore, the proposed rule change is consistent with Rule 603 of Regulation NMS,[9] 
           which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory. EDGA Book Viewer is accessed and subscribed to on a voluntary basis, in that neither the Exchange nor market data distributors are required by any rule or regulation to make this data available. Accordingly, distributors and subscribers can discontinue use at any time and for any reason.
In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such data. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data. The Exchange believes that the data products proposed herein are precisely the sort of market data products that the Commission envisioned when it adopted Regulation NMS. The Commission concluded that Regulation NMS—by lessening regulation of the market in proprietary data—would itself further the Act's goals of facilitating efficiency and competition:
[E]fficiency is promoted when broker-dealers who do not need the data beyond the prices, sizes, market center identifications of the NBBO and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive (and pay for) such data. The Commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when broker-dealers may choose to receive (and pay for) additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data.[10] 

By removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data, Regulation NMS advanced the goals of the Act and the principles reflected in its legislative history.
In addition, EDGA Book Viewer removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system because EDGA Book Viewer provides investors with alternative market data and competes with similar market data product currently offered by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (“NYSE”) and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Start Printed Page 50883(“Nasdaq”).[11] 
           The provision of new options for investors to receive market data was a primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by Regulation NMS.[12] 
           EDGA Book Viewer is precisely the sort of market data product that the Commission envisioned when it adopted Regulation NMS.
(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposal is not intended to address any competitive issues, but rather to memorialize in the Exchange's rules a data feed that is currently available through the Exchange's public Web site free of charge. Nonetheless, the Exchange believes that the proposal will promote competition by the Exchange offering a service similar to that offered by the NYSE and Nasdaq.[13] 
           Thus, the Exchange believes this proposed rule change is necessary to permit fair competition among national securities exchanges. Therefore, the Exchange does not believe the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others
The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
The Exchange has designated this rule filing as non-controversial under section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act [14] 
           and paragraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder.[15] 
           The proposed rule change effects a change that: (A) Does not significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest; (B) does not impose any significant burden on competition; and (C) by its terms, does not become operative for 30 days after the date of the filing, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate if consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest; provided that the self-regulatory organization has given the Commission written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission.[16] 

At any time within 60 days of the filing of the proposed rule change, the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is: (1) Necessary or appropriate in the public interest; (2) for the protection of investors; or (3) otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. If the Commission takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.
IV. Solicitation of Comments
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposal is consistent with the Act. Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods:

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        August 28, 2015.
        Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”),[1] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2] 

           notice is hereby given that on August 24, 2015, EDGA Exchange, Inc. (the “Exchange” or “EDGA”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Exchange has Start Printed Page 53371designated the proposed rule change as one establishing or changing a member due, fee, or other charge imposed by the Exchange under Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act [3] 
           and Rule 19b-4(f)(2) thereunder,[4] 
           which renders the proposed rule change effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 
I.  Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange filed a proposal to amend the Market Data section of its fee schedule to adopt fees for a market data product called EDGA Book Viewer.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Exchange's Web site at www.batstrading.com, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.
II.  Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.
(A)  Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 
1. Purpose
The Exchange proposes to amend the Market Data section of its fee schedule to adopt fees for market data product called EDGA Book Viewer. EDGA Book Viewer is a data feed that disseminates, on a real-time basis, the aggregated two-side quotations for up to five (5) price levels for all displayed orders for securities traded on the Exchange and for which the Exchanges reports quotes under the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. EDGA Book Viewer also contains the last ten (10) trades including time of trade, price and share quantity.[5] 
           EDGA Book Viewer is currently available via www.batstrading.com without charge.
The Exchange now proposes to amend its fee schedule to incorporate fees for distribution of EDGA Book Viewer to subscribers.[6] 
           EDGA Book Viewer will remain available via www.batstrading.com for viewing without charge. The proposed fees include the following, each of which are described in detail below: (i) Distribution Fees for both Internal and External Distributors; [7] 
           (ii) Usage Fees for both Professional [8] 
           and Non-Professional [9] 
           Users; [10] 
           (iii) an Enterprise Fee; [11] 
           and (iv) a Digital Media Enterprise Fee.

Distribution Fees. As proposed, each Internal Distributor that receives EDGA Book Viewer shall pay a fee of $500 per month. The Exchange does not propose to charge any User fees for EDGA Book Viewer where the data is received and subsequently internally distributed to Professional or Non-Professional Users. In addition, the Exchange proposes to charge External Distributors that receives EDGA Book Viewer a fee of $2,500 per month.

User Fees. The Exchange proposes to charge those who receive EDGA Book Viewer from External Distributors different fees for both their Professional Users and Non-Professional Users. The Exchange will assess a monthly fee for Professional Users of $3.00 per User. Non-Professional Users will be assessed a monthly fee of $0.10 per User. The Exchange does not propose to charge per User fees to Internal Distributors.
External Distributors that receives EDGA Book Viewer would be required to count every Professional User and Non-Professional User to which they provide EDGA Book Viewer, the requirements for which are identical to that currently in place for the BATS One Feed.[12] 
           Thus, the External Distributor's count will include every person and device that accesses the data regardless of the purpose for which the individual or device uses the data. External Distributors must report all Professional and Non-Professional Users in accordance with the following:

In connection with an External Distributor's distribution of EDGA Book Viewer, the Distributor should count as one User each unique User that the Distributor has entitled to have access to EDGA Book Viewer. However, where a device is dedicated specifically to a single individual, the Distributor should count only the individual and need not count the device.
The External Distributor should identify and report each unique User. If a User uses the same unique method to gain access to EDGA Book Viewer, the Distributor should count that as one User. However, if a unique User uses multiple methods to gain access to Start Printed Page 53372EDGA Book Viewer (e.g., a single User has multiple passwords and user identifications), the External Distributor should report all of those methods as an individual User.
External Distributors should report each unique individual person who receives access through multiple devices as one User so long as each device is dedicated specifically to that individual.
If an External Distributor entitles one or more individuals to use the same device, the External Distributor should include only the individuals, and not the device, in the count.

Each External Distributor will receive a credit against its monthly Distributor Fee for EDGA Book Viewer equal to the amount of its monthly Usage Fees up to a maximum of the Distributor Fee for EDGA Book Viewer. For example, an External Distributor will be subject to a $2,500 monthly Distributor Fee where they receive EDGA Book Viewer. If that External Distributor reports User quantities totaling $2,500 or more of monthly usage of EDGA Book Viewer, it will pay no net Distributor Fee, whereas if that same External Distributor were to report User quantities totaling $1,000 of monthly usage, it will pay a net of $1,500 for the Distributor Fee. External Distributors will remain subject to the per User fees discussed above.

Enterprise Fee. The Exchange also proposes to establish a $20,000 per month Enterprise Fee that will permit a recipient firm who receives EDGA Book Viewer from an External Distributor to receive the data for an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users. For example, if a recipient firm had 15,000 Professional Users who each receive EDGA Book Viewer at $3.00 per month, then that recipient firm will pay $45,000 per month in Professional Users fees. Under the proposed Enterprise Fee, the recipient firm will pay a flat fee of $20,000 for an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users for EDGA Book Viewer. A recipient firm must pay a separate Enterprise Fee for each External Distributor that controls the display of EDGA Book Viewer if it wishes such User to be covered by an Enterprise Fee rather than by per User fees. A recipient firm that pays the Enterprise Fee will not have to report its number of such Users on a monthly basis. However, every six months, a recipient firm must provide the Exchange with a count of the total number of natural person users of each product, including both Professional and Non-Professional Users. Lastly, the proposed Enterprise Fee would be counted towards the Distributor Fee credit described above, under which an External Distributor receives a credit towards its Distributor Fee equal to the amount of its monthly EDGA Book Viewer User fees.

Digital Media Enterprise Fee. The Exchange proposes to adopt a Digital Media Enterprise Fee of $5,000 per month for EDGA Book Viewer. As an alternative to proposed User fees discussed above, a recipient firm may purchase a monthly Digital Media Enterprise license to receive EDGA Book Viewer from an External Distributor to distribute to an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users for viewing via television, Web sites, and mobile devices for informational and non-trading purposes only without having to account for the extent of access to the data or the report the number of Users to the Exchange. Lastly, the proposed Digital Media Enterprise Fee would be counted towards the Distributor Fee credit described above, under which an External Distributor receives a credit towards its Distributor Fee equal to the amount of its monthly EDGA Book Viewer User fees.
Implementation Date
The Exchange proposes to implement the proposed changes to its fee schedule on September 8, 2015.
2. Statutory Basis
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the objectives of Section 6 of the Act,[13] 
           in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(4),[14] 
           in particular, as it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its members and other recipients of Exchange data. The Exchange believes that the proposed rates are equitable and non-discriminatory in that they apply uniformly to all recipients of Exchange data. The Exchange believes the proposed fees are competitive with those charged by other venues and, therefore, reasonable and equitably allocated to recipients. Lastly, the Exchange also believes that the proposed fees are reasonable and non-discriminatory because they will apply uniformly to all recipients of Exchange data.
The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 11(A) of the Act [15] 
           in that it supports (i) fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and (ii) the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities. Furthermore, the proposed rule change is consistent with Rule 603 of Regulation NMS,[16] 
           which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory. In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data.
In addition, the proposed fees would not permit unfair discrimination because all of the Exchange's customers and market data vendors will be subject to the proposed fees on an equivalent basis. EDGA Book Viewer is distributed and purchased on a voluntary basis, in that neither the Exchange nor market data distributors are required by any rule or regulation to make this data available. Accordingly, Distributors and Users can discontinue use at any time and for any reason, including due to an assessment of the reasonableness of fees charged. Firms have a wide variety of alternative market data products from which to choose, such as similar proprietary data products offered by other exchanges and consolidated data. Moreover, the Exchange is not required to make any proprietary data products available or to offer any specific pricing alternatives to any customers.
In addition, the fees that are the subject of this rule filing are constrained by competition. As explained below in the Exchange's Statement on Burden on Competition, the existence of alternatives to EDGA Book Viewer further ensures that the Exchange cannot set unreasonable fees, or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory, when vendors and subscribers can elect such alternatives. That is, the Exchange competes with other exchanges (and their affiliates) that provide similar market data products. If another exchange (or its affiliate) were to charge less to distribute its similar product than the Exchange charges to consolidate and distribute EDGA Book Viewer, prospective Users likely would Start Printed Page 53373not subscribe to, or would cease subscribing to, EDGA Book Viewer.
The Exchange notes that the Commission is not required to undertake a cost-of-service or rate-making approach. The Exchange believes that, even if it were possible as a matter of economic theory, cost-based pricing for non-core market data would be so complicated that it could not be done practically.[17] 


Distributor Fee. The Exchange believes that the proposed Distributor Fees are also reasonable, equitably allocated, and not unreasonably discriminatory. The fees for Members and non-Members are uniform except with respect to reasonable distinctions with respect to internal and external distribution.[18] 
           The Exchange believes that the Distributor Fees for EDGA Book Viewer are reasonable and fair in light of alternatives offered by other market centers. For example, EDGA Book Viewer provides investors with alternative market data and competes with similar market data product currently offered by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (“NYSE”) and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).[19] 
           Specifically, the NYSE charges an access fee of $5,000 per month for NYSE OpenBook,[20] 
           which is higher than the External Distributor fee proposed herein for EDGA Book Viewer.

User Fees. The Exchange believes that implementing the Professional and Non-Professional User fees for EDGA Book Viewer are equitable and reasonable because they will result in greater availability to Professional and Non-Professional Users. Moreover, introducing a modest Non-Professional User fee for EDGA Book Viewer is reasonable because it provides an additional method for retail investors to access EDGA Book Viewer data by providing the same data that is available to Professional Users. The Exchange believes that the proposed fees are equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because they will be charged uniformly to recipient firms and Users. The fee structure of differentiated Professional and Non-Professional fees is utilized by the Exchange for the BATS One Feed and has long been used by other exchanges for their proprietary data products, and by the Nasdaq UTP and the CTA and CQ Plans in order to reduce the price of data to retail investors and make it more broadly available.[21] 
           Offering EDGA Book Viewer to Non-Professional Users with the same data available to Professional Users results in greater equity among data recipients.
In addition, the proposed fees are reasonable when compared to similar fees for comparable products offered by the NYSE and Nasdaq. Specifically, NYSE offers NYSE OpenBook for a monthly fee of $60.00 per professional subscriber and $15 per non-professional subscriber.[22] 
           Nasdaq offers Nasdaq BookViewer for the same fees as Nasdaq TotalView, which is a monthly fee of $70.00 per professional subscriber and $14 per non-professional subscriber.[23] 
           The Exchange's proposed per User Fees for EDGA Book Viewer are less than the NYSE and Nasdaq fees.

Enterprise Fee. The proposed Enterprise Fee for EDGA Book Viewer is equitable and reasonable as the fees proposed are less than the enterprise fees currently charged for Nasdaq Book Viewer, which is subject to the exact same fees as Nasdaq TotalView. Nasdaq charges an enterprise fee of $100,000 per month for Nasdaq TotalView,[24] 
           which is far greater than the proposed Enterprise Fee of $20,000 per month for EDGA Book Viewer. In addition, the Enterprise Fee proposed by the Exchange could result in a fee reduction for recipient firms with a large number of Professional and Non-Professional Users. If a recipient firm has a smaller number of Professional Users of EDGA Book Viewer, then it may continue using the per User structure and benefit from the per User Fee reductions. By reducing prices for recipient firms with a large number of Professional and Non-Professional Users, the Exchange believes that more firms may choose to receive and to distribute EDGA Book Viewer, thereby expanding the distribution of this market data for the benefit of investors.
The Exchange further believes that the proposed Enterprise Fee is reasonable because it will simplify reporting for certain recipients that have large numbers of Professional and Non-Professional Users. Firms that pay the proposed Enterprise Fee will not have to report the number of Users on a monthly basis as they currently do, but rather will only have to count natural person users every six months, which is a significant reduction in administrative burden. Finally, the Exchange believes that it is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory to establish an Enterprise Fee because it reduces the Exchange's costs and the Distributor's administrative burdens in tracking and auditing large numbers of Users.Start Printed Page 53374


Digital Media Enterprise Fee. The Exchange believes that the proposed Digital Media Enterprise Fee for EDGA Book Viewer provides for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or dealers. In establishing the Digital Media Enterprise Fee, the Exchange recognizes that there is demand for a more seamless and easier-to-administer data distribution model that takes into account the expanded variety of media and communication devices that investors utilize today. The Exchange believes the Digital Media Enterprise Fee will be easy to administer because data recipients that purchase it would not be required to differentiate between Professional and Non-Professional Users, account for the extent of access to the data, or report the number of Users. This is a significant reduction on a recipient firm's administrative burdens and is a significant value to investors. For example, a television broadcaster could display EDGA Book Viewer data during market-related programming and on its Web site or allow viewers to view the data via their mobile devices, creating a more seamless distribution model that will allow investors more choice in how they receive and view market data, all without having to account for and/or measure who accesses the data and how often they do so.
The proposed Digital Media Enterprise Fee is equitable and reasonable because it will also enable recipient firms to more widely distribute data from EDGA Book Viewer to investors for informational purposes at a lower cost than is available today. For example, a recipient firm may purchase an Enterprise license in the amount of $20,000 per month for to receive EDGA Book Viewer from an External Distributor that receives the product for an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users, which is greater than the proposed Digital Media Enterprise Fee. The Exchange also believes the amount of the Digital Media Enterprise Fee is reasonable as compared to the existing enterprise fees discussed above because the distribution of EDGA Book Viewer data is limited to television, Web sites, and mobile devices for informational purposes only, while distribution of EDGA Book Viewer data pursuant to an Enterprise license contains no such limitation. The Exchange also believes that the proposed Digital Media Enterprise Fee is equitable and reasonable because it is less than similar fees charged by other exchanges.[25] 

(B)  Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. The Exchange's ability to price EDGA Book Viewer is constrained by: (i) Competition among exchanges, other trading platforms, and Trade Reporting Facilities (“TRF”) that compete with each other in a variety of dimensions; (ii) the existence of inexpensive real-time consolidated data and market-specific data and free delayed data; and (iii) the inherent contestability of the market for proprietary data.
The Exchange and its market data products are subject to significant competitive forces and the proposed fees represent responses to that competition. To start, the Exchange competes intensely for order flow. It competes with the other national securities exchanges that currently trade equities, with electronic communication networks, with quotes posted in FINRA's Alternative Display Facility, with alternative trading systems, and with securities firms that primarily trade as principal with their customer order flow.
In addition, EDGA Book Viewer competes with a number of alternative products. For instance, EDGA Book Viewer does provide a complete picture of all trading activity in a security. Rather, the other national securities exchanges, the several TRFs of FINRA, and Electronic Communication Networks (“ECN”) that produce proprietary data all produce trades and trade reports. Each is currently permitted to produce last sale information products, and many currently do, including Nasdaq and NYSE. In addition, market participants can gain access to EDGA last sale and depth-of-book quotations, though integrated with the prices of other markets, on feeds made available through the SIPs.
In sum, the availability of a variety of alternative sources of information imposes significant competitive pressures on Exchange data products and the Exchange's compelling need to attract order flow imposes significant competitive pressure on the Exchange to act equitably, fairly, and reasonably in setting the proposed data product fees. The proposed data product fees are, in part, responses to that pressure. The Exchange believes that the proposed fees would reflect an equitable allocation of its overall costs to users of its facilities.
In addition, when establishing the proposed fees, the Exchange considered the competitiveness of the market for proprietary data and all of the implications of that competition. The Exchange believes that it has considered all relevant factors and has not considered irrelevant factors in order to establish fair, reasonable, and not unreasonably discriminatory fees and an equitable allocation of fees among all Users. The existence of alternatives to EDGA Book Viewer, including existing similar feeds by other exchanges, consolidated data, and proprietary data from other sources, ensures that the Exchange cannot set unreasonable fees, or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory, when vendors and subscribers can elect these alternatives or choose not to purchase a specific proprietary data product if its cost to purchase is not justified by the returns any particular vendor or subscriber would achieve through the purchase.
(C)  Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others 
The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.
III.  Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action

     The Exchange believes that cost-based pricing would be impractical because it would create enormous administrative burdens for all parties, including the Commission, to cost-regulate a large number of participants and standardize and analyze extraordinary amounts of information, accounts, and reports. In addition, it is impossible to regulate market data prices in isolation from prices charged by markets for other services that are joint products. Cost-based rate regulation would also lead to litigation and may distort incentives, including those to minimize costs and to innovate, leading to further waste. Under cost-based pricing, the Commission would be burdened with determining a fair rate of return, and the industry could experience frequent rate increases based on escalating expense levels. Even in industries historically subject to utility regulation, cost-based ratemaking has been discredited. As such, the Exchange believes that cost-based ratemaking would be inappropriate for proprietary market data and inconsistent with Congress's direction that the Commission use its authority to foster the development of the national market system, and that market forces will continue to provide appropriate pricing discipline. See Appendix C to NYSE's comments to the Commission's 2000 Concept Release on the Regulation of Market Information Fees and Revenues, which can be found on the Commission's Web site at http://www.sec.gov/​rules/​concept/​s72899/​buck1.htm.
