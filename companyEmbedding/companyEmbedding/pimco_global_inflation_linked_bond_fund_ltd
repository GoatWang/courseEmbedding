This video is not a complete analysis of every material fact regarding any country, market, industry, security or fund. Because market and economic conditions are subject to change, comments, opinions and analyses are rendered as of February 6, 2017, and may change without notice. A portfolio manager’s assessment of a particular security, investment or strategy is not intended as individual investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell or hold any security or to adopt any investment strategy; it is intended only to provide insight into the fund’s portfolio selection process. Holdings are subject to change. The value of investments can go down as well as up, and investors may not get back the full amount invested.

The funds have a fee waiver associated with any investment they make in a Franklin Templeton money fund and/or other Franklin Templeton fund, contractually guaranteed through April 30, 2018. Fund investment results reflect the fee waiver; without this waiver, the results would have been lower.
The funds’ 30-day standardized yields are calculated over a trailing 30-day period using the yield to maturity on bonds and/or the dividends accrued on stocks. The yields may not equal the funds’ actual income distribution rates, which reflects the funds’ past dividends paid to shareholders.
The funds offer multiple share classes, which are subject to different fees and expenses that will affect their performance. Visit the fund information page for performance and fee details for other share classes: Templeton Global Bond Fund / Templeton Global Total Return Fund.
Effective 1/1/97, Templeton Global Bond Fund began offering Advisor Class shares. For periods prior to the fund's Advisor Class inception date, a restated figure is used based on the fund's oldest share class, Class A performance, excluding the effect of Class A's maximum initial sales charge but reflecting the effect of the Class A Rule 12b-1 fees; and for periods after the fund's Advisor Class inception date, actual Advisor Class performance is used, reflecting all charges and fees applicable to that class.

What are the risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Templeton Global Bond Fund
Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time, and can reduce returns. Derivatives, including currency management strategies, involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses (as well as enable gains) on an amount that exceeds the fund's initial investment. The fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised. The markets for particular securities or types of securities are or may become relatively illiquid. Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the security's value and on the fund's ability to sell such securities when necessary to meet the fund's liquidity needs or in response to a specific market event. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and economic and political uncertainties. Investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets' smaller size and lesser liquidity. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Changes in interest rates will affect the value of the fund's portfolio and its share price and yield. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. The fund is also non-diversified, which involves the risk of greater price fluctuation than a more diversified portfolio. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value.

Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the security's value and on the fund's ability to sell such securities when necessary to meet the fund's liquidity needs or in response to a specific market event. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations (which may be significant over the short term) and economic and political uncertainties; investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors. Sovereign debt securities are subject to various risks in addition to those relating to debt securities and foreign securities generally, including, but not limited to, the risk that a government entity may be unwilling or unable to pay interest and repay principal on its sovereign debt, or otherwise meet its obligations when due. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the funds' prospectus.
For more information on any funds, contact your financial advisor or download a prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund’s investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.

What Are the Risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. Thus, as the prices of bonds adjust to a rise in interest rates, the share price may decline. Investments in foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments. Investments in emerging market countries involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets’ smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Such investments could experience significant price volatility in any given year. High yields reflect the higher credit risk associated with these lower-rated securities and, in some cases, the lower market prices for these instruments. Interest rate movements may affect the share price and yield. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Treasuries, if held to maturity, offer a fixed rate of return and fixed principal value; their interest payments and principal are guaranteed.

WHAT IS GLOBAL MACRO SHIFTS?


Global Macro Shifts is a research-based briefing on global economies featuring the analysis and views of Dr. Michael Hasenstab and senior members of Templeton Global Macro.



Latest edition



Trade and Taxes in a World with Borders
US policy continues to be an important topic for investors throughout the world. Recently, the potential for US corporate tax reform and a border adjustment tax (BAT) stirred debate not only within the US government but also among global investors. Templeton Global Macro examines how a BAT would work, its likely effect on prices and exchange rates, its implications for the longer-term macroeconomic outlook, its impact on different domestic sectors and trade flows, and the potential ramifications for international trade relations.​

PIMCO Launches Global TIPS ETFHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0PIMCO Launches Global TIPS ETF Eric Dutram ZacksMay 3, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareJust two months after PIMCO’s incredible success with the Total Return ETF (BOND), it looks as though the California-based bond management giant is back at it again with another new fund. This time, PIMCO looks to help investors better manage inflation expectations in the fixed income world via its Global Advantage Inflation-Linked Bond Strategy Fund (ILB).This product is an actively-managed ETF that primarily consists of high-quality inflation linked bonds that span across developed and emerging markets. Investors should also note that the product will not and cannot use options, futures, or swaps in its strategy, while expenses look to come in at 0.60% a year after waivers.TIPS In FocusGenerally speaking, bonds included in this fund are tied to the CPI of a particular region or nation and look to provide a degree of protection against inflation. This is done by increasing or decreasing the face value of the bond based on observed changes in CPI and then paying out a real rate of return based on this figure to investors (read Is The Bear Market For Bond ETFs Finally Here?).In the case of U.S. TIPS, this process is done twice a year and bonds are not permitted to fall below their par value level. Thanks to this, deflation isn’t very much of a problem for TIPS, especially if prices are already close to the levels they were at when the bonds were first issued.The main downside to this approach is that investors often have to accept a lower yield in order to obtain the inflation protection. The securities are backed by the government and have virtually no credit or inflation risk, unlike many other bond securities, so while you will be well-insulated from many risks, investors seeking high levels of current income could be disappointed (also read Are The Fundamental Bond ETFs Better Fixed Income Picks?).ILB’s unique approachUnlike many ETFs in the TIPS segment, ILB has a broad focus which includes both American and international inflation-protected sovereign bonds. As such, it can act as a global barometer for the space, holding both developed and emerging inflation-linked bonds. Furthermore, most of the products in the TIPS ETF world are passively managed, making ILB’s active approach relatively unique.This strategy is also based on PIMCO’s ability to apply their views on individual countries and their inflation expectations and currency situations to the TIPS market. Additionally, the team also takes a special look at maturity and duration positioning in order to achieve a nice balance between risk and reward (see Three Outperforming Active ETFs).It should also be noted that the product is also going to put itself up against a GDP-based secondary benchmark for inflation linked bonds. This index looks to focus on economies that are driving global growth rather than maintain exposure to market cap-weighted, more traditional, systems.Nevertheless, the approach tilts the fund towards the world’s biggest issuer of Treasury securities, the United States. Securities from America constitute over 85% of the portfolio, while Australia, Mexico, Brazil, and the UK, round out the rest of the top five (see more in the Zacks ETF Center).In total, the product holds 38 securities in its basket and has a relatively short effective duration of just over seven years. Unfortunately, yield data is not available yet due to the newness of the product, although similar—but passively managed—funds in the TIPS market pay out 30-Day SEC Yields around the 4.2% mark.TIPS ETF CompetitionCurrently, there are a number of ETFs in the inflation-linked bond space, including several from PIMCO. However, these are usually focused on the American space although a few companies have launched international inflation-linked bond ETFs as well. Beyond these, the only true competition in the space at this time looks to be the Global Inflation-Linked Bond Fund (GTIP).This fund tracks the BofA Merrill Lynch Global Diversified Inflation-Linked Index which is a benchmark of inflation-linked bonds from around the world. Currently, the product charges just 40 basis points a year in fees and pays out a robust 4.2% yield to investors.In terms of exposure, assets are tilted towards American securities, although bonds from the UK, Brazil, and France round out the top four. The portfolio’s breakdown for duration is also skewed towards the middle of the curve; the weighted average maturity is about 11.9 years with the majority of bonds coming due from 1-10 years from now (also read PIMCO Total Return ETF Launches).However, investors should note that the product has failed to amass a great deal in assets as it still has less than $20 million in AUM. Yet with that being said, PIMCO’s new Total Return fund has seen a great deal of interest as have many of the firms other TIPS-focused products.As a result, the company may be able to, with its unique methodology, buck the trend in this global inflation-linked bond space and accumulate a robust amount of assets, although only time will tell with this brand new bond ETF.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pimco to launch Global Advantage Inflation-Linked Bond Strategy ETF (ILB)

    Apr 25th, 2012    |
    By    Simon Smith, CFA    |
    Category:    Fixed Income 

Bond fund giant Pimco has announced the forthcoming launch of the Pimco Global Advantage Inflation-Linked Bond Strategy ETF (ILB), an actively managed ETF designed to offer investors the potential for long-term returns above inflation.
The Pimco Global Advantage Inflation-Linked Bond Strategy ETF (ILB) will be managed by Mihir Worah (pictured), managing director and head of Pimco’s real return team.
The fund, to be listed on the NYSE, will be managed by Mihir Worah, managing director and head of Pimco’s real return portfolio management team, and will actively invest in global inflation-linked bonds and currencies.
ILB continues the expansion of Pimco’s range of actively managed ETFs, which marry Pimco’s experience managing global fixed income investments with the tradability of an ETF vehicle, providing investors intraday pricing and daily portfolio disclosures in a single share class.
With globalisation exposing investors to price pressures and growth patterns of countries around the world, Pimco believes that investors need to consider a fuller set of inflation-oriented investments, rather than solely the investor’s domestic market. By exploiting a wider, global selection of inflation-linked bonds and currencies (the fund will be split approximately 70% developed and 30% emerging markets), ILB aims to deliver a more diversified inflation protection strategy.
Importantly, ILB will also be actively managed against a gross domestic product (GDP)-weighted benchmark, with the intent to better align investors’ exposure to countries experiencing stronger growth. This is in contrast to traditional market-cap weighted benchmarks, which allocate relative to the inflation-linked bond issuance of each country.
“In this uncertain global economy, some of the key drivers of growth are developing economies, which are often more sensitive to inflationary pressures like commodity prices,” said Worah. “Our forward-looking ‘Global Advantage’ approach aims to expose investors to the inflation-linked bonds and currencies of these faster-growing economies, potentially resulting in higher real yields than traditional investing using market cap-weighting.”
Pimco is one of the world’s largest managers of inflation-linked bonds and manages more than $100 billion in dedicated inflation hedging strategies. The fund will list on 1 May 2012.
ILB follows the recent launch of the actively managed Pimco Total Return ETF (BOND), which launched on 1 March 2012 and has already gathered over $539m in AUM.You may also be interested in:PIMCO swaps management team on flagship active bond ETFPimco unveils actively managed foreign currency strategy ETFPimco Total Return ETF officially goes liveThe name’s BOND: Pimco changes Total Return ETF tickerPimco working on plans to launch further active ETFsPimco launches Emerging Markets Advantage Local Bond Index Source ETFVanguard unveils short-term TIPS ETF (VTIP)Pimco and Source unveil actively managed covered bond ETFSSGA’s international government inflation-linked bond ETF adopts Citi indexPIMCO launches Australia Bond Index ETF; Canada and Germany to followPimco Total Return ETF: Date set for hotly awaited launchSSgA SPDR unveils world’s first emerging markets inflation-linked bond ETFPimco, Source add GBP trading line to EM local bond ETFBill Gross’s Pimco Total Return ETF (TRXT) set to be ‘bellwether’ active ETFPIMCO: Bonds are different – the active advantage

U.K. All Asset Strategy





Profile Main Body​ What Is the U.K. All Asset Strategy?
The PIMCO U.K. All Asset Strategy is a highly diversified, tactical asset allocation solution that has a simple goal: Deliver significant real returns (returns in excess of inflation) with modest volatility. The strategy allocates across a broad range of underlying strategies in an effort to produce long-term returns consistent with its benchmark: RPI +4% (RPI is the Retail Price Index, the measure of U.K. inflation). In so doing, the strategy seeks to help investors with several critical goals:
Hedge inflation risk
Provide a compelling level of total return potential
Enhance portfolio diversification away from mainstream stocks and bonds
Deliver these characteristics with modest total volatility 
The U.K. All Asset Strategy represents a joint effort between PIMCO and Research Affiliates, an investment advisory firm founded by Rob Arnott. PIMCO provides the broad range of underlying strategies, which spans global stocks, global bonds, commodities, real estate and other liquid alternative strategies. PIMCO also provides active management excess return (alpha) potential within each. Research Affiliates determines the appropriate asset allocation mix of the underlying strategies to target the stated return and volatility goals.
 
​U.K. All Asset Strategy – The Investment Domain
​The U.K. All Asset Strategy is designed to fit a variety of investor needs and is therefore used by individuals and institutions to address a range of goals within a portfolio, including but not limited to the following:  
Inflation Hedging Solution: If you’re seeking to increase the allocation to inflation hedging investments but are concerned with low yields typically offered by U.K. index-linked gilts, the volatility of commodities and real estate or the illiquidity associated with other real assets, then the U.K. All Asset Strategy may offer a compelling opportunity to hedge inflation risk, capture high real return potential and do so with modest volatility. 
 
Alternative to Traditional Fixed Income: If you’re seeking an investment that has bond-like characteristics in terms of total volatility and correlation to other assets, yet has greater flexibility to navigate changing global interest rates and yield spreads, then the U.K. All Asset Strategy may offer a compelling opportunity to replace traditional fixed income with a more diversified and adaptable allocation. 
 
Equity Replacement/Diversifier: If you’re seeking a higher level of returns, one that has often been associated with equities, yet want to diversify – not amplify – the equity risk already in your portfolio, then the U.K. All Asset Strategy may offer a compelling opportunity to pursue equity-like returns with reduced volatility and downside risk, and with diversification benefits. 
 
Tactical Asset Allocation Solution: If you’re evaluating multi-asset class strategies that offer outperformance potential through diversification and tactical allocation decisions, then the U.K. All Asset Strategy may offer a compelling solution in that it combines a truly broad opportunity set, active management alpha potential and a disciplined investment process to tactically manage the mix in a single investment. 
​PIMCO’s Real Return Experience 
​In addition to the U.K. All Asset Strategy, PIMCO offers expertise across a range of other real return products that seek to provide consistent after-inflation returns and portfolio diversification to meet investor needs:  Inflation-Linked Bonds: Portfolios benchmarked to global or regional inflation-linked bond benchmarks. These core real return assets can provide a direct return linkage to actual inflation, in addition to liquidity and low credit risk.
Commodities: Portfolios benchmarked to diversified commodity indexes. These investments are designed to hedge against inflation “surprises,” and historically have provided strong diversification characteristics.
​Investment Process
​The PIMCO U.K. All Asset Strategy invests in a broad spectrum of underlying investment strategies, which include global bonds, global stocks, commodities and real estate. While the U.K. All Asset Strategy can invest in almost any PIMCO strategy in an effort to achieve its return and risk objectives, the following is a representative list of the opportunity set:

Equity-Related Strategies Global StocksPLUS® U.K. StocksPLUS® The asset allocation decisions within the U.K. All Asset Strategy are actively managed by Research Affiliates, LLC, a subadvisory firm founded by Rob Arnott that possesses demonstrated expertise in asset allocation. The investment process evaluates four essential “building blocks” of returns and is complemented by a qualitative fifth step to help ensure a robust outcome. 
Potential for Long-Term Real Returns: Each underlying investment is evaluated for its long-term real return potential by assessing its current yield and expected income growth, net of inflation. 
Potential Value Added by PIMCO: Since each underlying investment is actively managed by PIMCO, an adjustment is made to the return estimate for that asset class based on the consistency and level of excess return that the respective PIMCO portfolio manager has historically delivered.
Potential for Valuation Change: Key valuation metrics are evaluated for each underlying investment in order to assess absolute and relative value, the likelihood of a valuation change and to what extent that alters the near-term return potential for that investment. 
Impact from Economic and Technical Factors: Additional inputs are considered to refine return and risk forecasts, such as the current stage of the business cycle, the transition probability to the next stage and, where relevant, select technical indicators such as lead, lag, momentum or mean reversion factors.
Subjective Considerations: Experts at PIMCO and Research Affiliates possess a wide depth and breadth of experience across various global asset classes. Formally once a month, and informally as required, key personnel at both firms engage in substantive dialogue to identify any factors that might have been missed by the quantitative process and if those warrant a modest subjective adjustment to the model-driven allocations. 
​Sources of Added Value
​Investors seek high real returns in order to meet their return goals, hedge inflation risk and grow the purchasing power of their savings. Going forward, this level of real returns may not be achieved by conventional allocations centered on mainstream stocks and bonds.  
With that in mind, the U.K. All Asset Strategy combines three sources of added value in an effort to achieve the RPI + 4% benchmark. First, it expands the investment opportunity set far beyond mainstream stocks and bonds, so that investors can access a wider range of return-generating and inflation-hedging sectors. Second, it incorporates the potential for excess returns (alpha) above passive indexes in each underlying strategy through PIMCO’s active management expertise. Third, it incorporates the tactical asset allocation decisions of Research Affiliates, which uses a demonstrated, disciplined process aimed at both enhancing returns and mitigating risk by changing the mix of underlying strategies over time.
​About the Subadviser
​PIMCO’s All Asset Strategies are subadvised by Research Affiliates, LLC, an advisory firm founded and majority-owned by Robert Arnott. He is author of more than sixty articles appearing in periodicals like the Financial Analysts Journal, the Journal of Portfolio Management, and the Harvard Business Review. He has served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Portfolio Management, Journal of Investing, and Journal of Wealth Management, as a founding member of the Chairman’s Advisory Council of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and on the product advisory boards of the Chicago Mercantile and Toronto Stock Exchanges. He co-edited the first and second editions of Active Asset Allocation (Probus Press; 1988, 1992) and Style Management (1996, 1998). He has contributed chapters to numerous books, including some of the core readings for the CFA program.
Mr. Arnott has a reputation as a practitioner for creating innovative investment products. He previously served as equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, and as president and chief investment officer at TSA Capital Management, and also served as chairman of First Quadrant. He graduated summa cum laude from UC Santa Barbara in economics, applied mathematics, and computer science.
​Risk Management/Controls
​ PIMCO and Research Affiliates collaborate to help ensure that investors in the U.K. All Asset Strategy benefit from the significant commitment to risk management by both of these organizations. PIMCO, which has extensive asset management experience, controls the operational risk of the All Asset portfolios as well as the investment and operational risk of all underlying strategies. Research Affiliates, which serves as the asset allocation subadvisrr, controls the investment risk associated with asset allocation decisions.

Profile Disclaimer​1. The All Asset Strategy does not intend to use leverage to amplify exposures of underlying strategies. However, certain transactions within the underlying strategies, such as the use of derivatives, where permitted, may give rise to leverage within those strategies, causing them to potentially be more volatile than if they had not been leveraged.
O.N.S. UK Retail Prices Index All Items (Non-Seasonally Adjusted) Plus 4% benchmark is created by adding 4% to the annual percentage change in the Office of National Statistics Retail Prices Index All Items (Non-Seasonally Adjusted) (“RPI”). This index reflects nonseasonally adjusted returns. The UK Retail Prices Index is an unmanaged index representing the average measure of change in the prices of goods and services bought for the purpose of consumption by the vast majority of households in the UK as determined by the Office of National Statistics. It is not possible to invest directly in an unmanaged index.





Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. The value of shares can go up as well as down. The strategy may invest a portion of its assets in non-Euro securities, which can entail greater risks due to non-Euro economic and political developments. This risk may be enhanced when investing in Emerging Markets. Investment in a strategy that invests in high-yield, lower-rated securities, will generally involve greater volatility and risk to principal than investments in higher-rated securities. This strategy may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes or as part of its investment strategy. Use of these instruments may involve certain costs and risks. Portfolios investing in derivatives could lose more than the principal amount invested.

Overview IntroductionThe PIMCO Global Advantage Bond Index (GLADI) is an innovative investment grade, multi-sector fixed income benchmark. Launched in January 2009, GLADI is designed to better capture investment opportunities in a rapidly changing world. Intended to offer investors an improved benchmark for fixed income market “beta,” GLADI provides a building block for portfolios with the potential for higher risk-adjusted returns.

A More Thoughtful Approach to Bond Indexing
The global economy is in the midst of dramatic transformations that challenge the ability of traditional investment approaches to generate sustainable returns, while also managing risks. One profound change crucial to bond investing is the explosion of public debt levels in industrialized countries. Traditional bond indexes – by virtue of their market capitalization-weighting methodology – have an inherent structural bias to overweight countries with high levels of debt. As concerns about sovereign creditworthiness have become increasingly critical to asset allocation, there has been greater urgency for an alternative to traditional approaches.
Through its broader coverage and unique construction methodology, GLADI explicitly recognizes the need for investors to position their fixed income portfolios within this changing global environment. Several core features distinguish GLADI from traditional fixed income indices, including:
An innovative GDP-weighting methodology that is designed to avoid the disadvantages of traditional indexes based solely on market capitalization weighting
A continuum in coverage from developed to emerging markets, capturing the fuller set of global investment grade opportunities and avoiding a lopsided weighting toward developed markets
Inclusion of inflation-linked bonds in addition to nominal bonds, providing a partial built-in hedge against potential inflationary pressures
A global beta that evolves with the world’s economic structure, providing broad exposure to a diversified basket of global currencies, especially currencies of creditor countries in the emerging world
Advantages of GDP Weighting
GLADI weights index components based on gross domestic product (GDP) as an alternative to the market capitalization weights used by most existing fixed income indexes. GDP weighting offers a number of relative potential benefits:
1. Higher allocation to low-debt countries.Because larger stocks of debt mean higher market capitalization, market capitalization-weighted indexes are at a structural disadvantage as they have a bias to assign greater weights to highly indebted countries, even though the credit quality of those issuers may be eventually compromised by their debt load.In contrast, GLADI’s GDP-weighted approach bases allocation on national income (GDP), which embodies the capacity to repay debt. The income-oriented approach produces a bond beta with an emphasis on countries with lower leverage, or lower levels of debt relative to their ability to service the debt, as illustrated in Figure 1.
 
2. Forward-looking.Fundamental transformations in global capital markets are reshaping the financial landscape for retail and institutional investors. Market capitalization-weighted indexes fail to capture these changes because they are inherently backward-looking, reflecting past patterns of debt issuance. Since rapid economic growth tends to precede the liberalization and deepening of capital markets, GLADI’s GDP weighting is designed to capture the opportunities that exist in the world’s most dynamic economies. By embedding a concept of where capital markets will be in the future – rather than where they have been in the past – GLADI helps investors position their portfolios to reap potential first-mover benefits.
3. Counter-cyclical rebalancing.Another well-known disadvantage of market capitalization-weighted indexes is that they assign progressively greater weight to securities as they go up in price, exactly the opposite of the investment maxim to “buy low, sell high.” GLADI not only is designed to avoid this pitfall of market capitalization weighting, but also has the potential to benefit from counter-cyclical rebalancing, since bond prices tend to move inversely to GDP growth over the business cycle, with bond prices rising as economic growth slows, and falling as economic growth accelerates. A GDP-weighted index that increases the relative weight of countries in the expansion phase of the business cycle (when bond prices are low) and reduces the relative weight of countries in the contraction phase (when bond prices are high), helps embed a “buy low, sell high” bias, as illustrated in Figure 2.
​​















The PIMCO Global Advantage Bond Index (GLADI) is a diversified global index that covers a wide spectrum of global fixed income opportunities and sectors, from developed to emerging markets, nominal to real assets, and cash to derivative instruments. Unlike traditional indices, which are frequently comprised of bonds weighted according to their market capitalization, GLADI uses GDP-weighting which puts an emphasis on faster-growing areas of the world and thus makes the index forward-looking in nature.

Methodology
The construction of GLADI follows three steps: (1) regional weights are assigned based upon the relative GDP shares of the respective major regions in the global economy, (2) factor/instrument category weights are identified based upon the primary sources of fixed income risk/return available to global investors within each region, and (3) security selection within each sub-index is guided by a set of rules and a market profile process designed to ensure that the index is investable and can be replicated in a portfolio of liquid securities. Figure 3 illustrates the process.
Figure 3: Three steps in constructing GLADI

Step 1: Assign regional weights by gross domestic product

Market Profile Process Select set of liquid securities to represent maturity and industry profile of broader market

Step 1: Regional weights
The regional classification distinguishes the major economic regions listed in Figure 3, with the weight of each region in GLADI determined by its respective share of global GDP. GDP shares are calculated as the simple average of each region’s share of global GDP for the previous five years, measured in nominal U.S. dollars at market exchange rates. The GDP data come from the International Monetary Fund. GDP weights are revised annually, with the new weights becoming effective on 31 October of each year. Figure 4 displays the current regional target weights for GLADI, based on the annual review that became effective on 31 October 2015.
 
Step 2: Instruments weights and sub-index target weights
As discussed above, market capitalization weighting has the disadvantage of increasing the weight of securities as they become more expensive. In addition, market capitalization-weighted global indexes tend to be dominated by government bonds because of their large historical issuance, despite the fact that many bond managers tend to use other instruments, such as interest rate swaps, as a substitute for the interest rate duration that comes from government securities.
To avoid these issues, GLADI takes a different approach, employing a proportional weighting system based on the key sources of fixed income risk and return. Of particular importance are: (1) interest rate duration, reflecting the sensitivity of bond prices to changes in nominal and real yields; (2) credit premiums, reflecting the higher yields available on securities with credit risk; and (3) securitized instrument premiums, reflecting embedded pre-payment options and other premiums associated with mortgage-backed securities. In the absence of a robust theoretical or empirical rationale for departing from a parsimonious equal weighting of each of these factors, this is adopted as the preferred weighting scheme.
The implementation of Steps 1 and 2 is illustrated in Figure 5, where each respective region’s GDP weight (Column A) is multiplied by the proportional instrument category weight (Column B) to produce the 17 sub-index target weights(Column C).
For the United States, the eurozone, and other industrialized countries, the application of this framework is straightforward: the 1/3 interest rate duration component is represented by a mix of two parts interest rate swaps and one part inflation-protected securities; the 1/3 credit premium component is represented by fixed-rate corporate bonds; and the 1/3 securitized instrument premium component is represented by U.S. Agency mortgage-backed security TBAs, mortgage-backed bonds in Canada and Denmark, and covered bonds and Pfandbriefe in the eurozone, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
In other markets, adjustments to this methodology are incorporated to reflect the availability of certain categories of instruments.
For Japan, where liquidity in the corporate bond market is highly limited and there is no substantial securitized market, only the interest rate duration component is included.
For emerging markets, the lack of liquid interest rate swap markets means that internal local currency-denominated government bonds are used to represent the interest rate duration risk factor, while U.S. dollar- and euro-denominated external sovereign bonds are used to represent credit premiums. Due to the lack of widespread securitized markets at this time, this category is not represented for emerging markets. However, because short-duration local currency investments have become a staple of global investment in these markets, currency – represented by short-dated foreign exchange derivatives – is included as a separate category.
 
Step 3. Security selection
The final step is to determine the specific securities that will be included in each of the sub-indexes.
The universe of potential securities is defined by a series of eligibility criteria. In order to preserve replicability and investability, the number of securities selected within each market is limited, depending on the size of the market and liquidity considerations. When the actual number of securities in the market exceeds the limit, a market profile process is applied to select the securities that will be included in the index. The market profile process refines the universe of eligible securities to identify the most representative and liquid securities, producing an index that is replicable and investable.
A. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
Credit quality. Eligible instruments must be investment grade (BBB- or higher). The average rating from Moody’s, S&P and Fitch is considered when available. Instruments downgraded to below investment grade are removed from the index upon monthly reconstitution.
Instrument type. Outside of derivatives instruments, only fixed-rate, non-callable (except for mortgage-backed securities) bullet bonds or sinking funds issued by developed and emerging governments, corporations and securitization entities are eligible.
Remaining maturity. All emerging market, inflation protected, corporate and securitized bonds must have at least 12 months remaining until maturity. Securities with maturities of less than 12 months upon monthly reconstitution are excluded from the index.
Minimum par amount outstanding. Eligible instruments must have a current par amount outstanding greater than or equal to a minimum amount that differs by instrument and is currency specific. Minimum par for inflation-protected bonds is 2 billion USD or the approximate foreign currency equivalent. For corporate bonds, the minimum is 500 million USD, 100 million GBP or 300 million CAD, EUR, AUD or CHF. Securitized bonds must have a minimum par of 1 billion CAD or EUR, 100 million GBP, 300 million CHF, 2 billion SEK or 3 billion DKK. For emerging markets, the minimum for external bonds is 500 million USD or EUR, while local bonds must have a minimum local currency equivalent of 100 million USD. 
B. MARKET PROFILE
The market profile process is used for the corporate, securitized and emerging market local bond sub-indexes of GLADI. The objective of the process is to create an index that is replicable and investable by identifying the most representative and liquid bonds in each sector of the market.
The market profile process for each sub-index varies depending on the particular attributes of that sector, but the basic process involves three steps, illustrated in Figure 6 with an example from the U.S. corporates sub-index.
1. Create a market structure matrix, which classifies all bonds according to the most relevant factors in that market.
2. Calculate the number of bonds to be selected for the market profile for each cell by multiplying the cell’s market share by the overall target number of bonds for the sub-index.
3. Select the highest-ranked individual securities (based on a set of ranking criteria – see box inside Figure 6), until the target number of bonds per cell is satisfied. Only one bond per issuer is considered in each cell until one bond from each issuer represented in that cell has been selected. If the number of bonds required is larger than the number of issuers, a second bond is selected from each issuer according to the rank until the required number of bonds has been selected.
Streamlined market profiles are also used for the interest rate swap and emerging market foreign exchange components of the index. A basket of 2-year, 5-year, 10-year and 30-year swaps are used to represent the interest rate swap sub-indexes, while a basket of 1-month, 2-month and 3-month foreign exchange forwards are used to represent the emerging market currency sub-index.
Figure 6: Market profile example: U.S. corporates

1. For U.S. corporates, the relevant factors are industry sector and maturity. Bonds are assigned to cells in the matrix based on their sector (senior financial, subordinated financial, non-financial consumer and non-financial industrial) and maturity band (1-7 years, 7-15 years, 15+ years). In this example, 6% of the total market value of the U.S. corporate universe is in the cell corresponding to financials with 7-15 years maturity.
2. Calculate the number of bonds to be selected for the market profile for each cell by multiplying the cell’s market share by the overall target number of bonds for the sub-index. The overall target number of bonds for the U.S. corporate sub-index is 500. Using the example above where financial sector bonds of 7-15 year maturity represent 6% of the universe, 30 bonds should be selected for this cell (500 x 6% = 30).
3. For this example, bonds issued within the last five years would be the first considered for index inclusion, with these bonds ranked based on 1) the amount outstanding, 2) time since issue, 3) remaining time to maturity and 4) issuer size.
​
				











Index Attributes
The index methodology described above produces an index that is broadly diversified across instruments, regions, currencies and maturities. Key attributes of the GLADI overall index and sub-indexes are presented in the accompanying figures. Figures 7 through 11 show index data as of 31 October 2015.
 
 
 
Reweighting and Rebalancing
Target regional weights for GLADI will be revised in an annual review, with the new weights becoming effective on 31 October of each year. Under most circumstances, year-to-year changes in the sub-index target weights will come only from changes in the regional weights, which will shift as relative shares of global GDP shift. On occasion, the instrument category weights may also be changed at the annual review to reflect the development of new instrument categories and other innovations in global capital markets.
The actual weights of the GLADI sub-indexes on a daily basis will deviate from their target weights, reflecting changes in the prices of the underlying instruments in the index. On a quarterly basis (31 October, 31 January, 30 April, 31 July), the GLADI will be rebalanced to restore the actual sub-index weights to their targeted levels.
On a monthly basis, countries that no longer meet eligibility requirements will be removed and securities within each country will be added and removed at month-end according to GLADI eligibility criteria.
 
Index Administration and Data
GLADI ILB will be administered and calculated independently from PIMCO by BofA Merrill Lynch, an unaffiliated leading global index provider. BofA Merrill Lynch will be responsible for the ongoing application of the index methodology, identification of index constituents and all other technical matters connected to the calculation and provision of index data.

Pimco To Launch Global TIPS ETF May 1


April 24, 2012, 07:40:30 PM EDT
By Olivier Ludwig, IndexUniverse

Pimco, the world's biggest bond fund manager, set May 1 as the
launch date for its actively managed Pimco Global Advantage
Inflation-Linked Bond Strategy Fund (NYSEArca:ILB)-exactly two
months after the rollout of Bill Gross' Pimco Total Return ETF
(NYSEArca:BOND).
ILB will, under normal circumstances, invest at least 80 percent
of its assets in inflation-linked bonds that are tied to at least
three developed and emerging market countries, according to
regulatory paperwork detailing ILB that the company first filed in
November 2010. Those countries can include the U.S., the filing
said.
"In this uncertain global economy, some of the key drivers of
growth are developing economies, which are often more sensitive to
inflationary pressures like commodity prices," Mihir Worah, the
portfolio manager who will run the new global TIPs fund, said in a
press release.
"Our forward-looking Global Advantage approach aims to expose
investors to the inflation-linked bonds and currencies of these
faster-growing economies, potentially resulting in higher real
yields than traditional investing using market-cap weighting,"
Worah added.
The launch of ILB will mark Pimco's latest attempt to breathe
life into the world of active ETFs. Active ETF strategies make up
less than 1 percent of the nearly $1.2 trillion in ETF assets, but
by the looks of it, the Newport Beach, Calif.-based company is
making inroads toward changing that.
BOND-the ETF version of Gross' $250 billion Total Return Fund,
the biggest mutual fund in the world-has gathered more than $500
million in less than eight weeks, a successful beginning by any
measure.
Also, the Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Strategy Fund
(NYSEArca:MINT), a money-marketlike ETF, has $1.53 billion in
assets, making it the biggest active ETF to date. The WisdomTree
Emerging Markets Local Debt Fund (NYSEArca:ELD) comes in a close
second, with $1.25 billion in assets.
Interest in inflation-protected bonds has been on the upswing
amid growing concern among investors that excessive monetary
stimulus from central banks such as the Federal Reserve is creating
inflationary pressure that will rear its head before long.
The iShares Barclays TIPS Bond (NYSEArca:TIP), the biggest
fixed-income ETF and the eighth-biggest U.S. ETF at the end of
March, had $22.51 billion in assets as of April 23, according to
data compiled by IndexUniverse.com.
The effective duration of the planned ETF will normally vary
within plus or minus two years of the effective duration of the
Pimco Global Advantage Inflation-Linked Bond Index. Duration is a
measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to
changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the
more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates, the filing
said.
The value of the bond's principal or the interest income paid is
adjusted to track changes in an official inflation measure.

Peering Under the Hood of PIMCO's Real Return Team
Part 1 of a Q&A with Mihir Worah, head of the firm's real return portfolio management team.


Michelle Canavan, 09/16/2013

We guide PIMCO's thinking on commodities from A to Z, so we needed to get more resources in commodities. So, two key senior-level additions in commodities. One is Greg Sharenow, who joined about two years ago and focuses on energy, that being the most important macro commodity and one where we see a lot of opportunity to add alpha for our clients. A second addition--this is brand new, just started a month ago--is Gillian Rutherford. She is a grain specialist, an agricultural commodity specialist. She's a great addition and just a wonderful resource.
Once we have the energy sector covered, the two other major sectors in commodities are metals and grains. I was actually searching for a metals specialist initially because again that fits into PIMCO's style, because metals have macroeconomic importance. So a metals specialist would add alpha to my commodity funds, but would also be able to guide PIMCO's thinking on what's happening in the emerging markets or what metal copper prices are doing, for example.


But through the course of my search, what I found was that there weren't that many alpha opportunities in the metals markets, and all of the traders and portfolio managers I was speaking to in metals, I didn't feel they had the right skill set. Meanwhile, we've been very successfully adding a lot of alpha in grains. After energy, our second biggest active source of alpha in the commodity complex has been the agricultural sector. So we started searching for an agricultural commodity specialist and ended up hiring Gillian Rutherford about a month ago.
Those are the two senior hires. We also have two junior additions on the commodity side. Andrew DeWitt and Yi Chian Chang help us with analysis and trade execution, and I hope to develop the junior people. I hope in a couple of years they'll be strong PIMCO-caliber portfolio managers, too.
 
The Team's Offerings Worah: The most noticeable product development has been the launch of the GLADI [a suite of indexes that concentrates on a country's GDP rather than its market capitalization], or Global Advantage Inflation-Linked Bond Index and suite of products. We have the PIMCO Global Advantage Inflation-Linked Bond ILB exchange-traded fund in the U.S., and the PIMCO GIS Global Advantage Real Return UCITS Fund. But with real interest rates in the United States and the developed markets artificially repressed and expected to stay low, we thought long-term inflation hedging--by long-term investors who are looking for bond-market inflation hedges--would be well served by having a strategic exposure to emerging-markets inflation-linked bonds, and so we launched the Global Advantage suite of products last year. (Click here for a table of sample strategies offered by PIMCO's real return team.)
In commodities, we launched the PIMCO CommoditiesPLUS Strategy as a complement to our commodity flagship, PIMCO Commodity Real Return Strategy, to offer our clients two things. The same ideas back both funds, but CommoditiesPlus is much more active in commodity management, with a larger tracking error and larger concentration. It also offers the possibility of having more pure commodity exposure; that is, commodities plus enhanced cash as opposed to the commodities plus TIPS combination of Commodity Real Return. Often the TIPS performance significantly adds to or detracts from the commodity performance, and you don't get that pure commodity exposure. So we launched the CommoditiesPLUS Fund. 
Then the final thing, which you know we did almost two years ago now, is the PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset Fund, which to us was a response to client requests for basically a one-stop real-return product where they would not have to decide. They were looking for long-term positive real returns, but they didn't want to make the choice between TIPS, commodities, REITs, and so on. Given PIMCO's developing asset-allocation capabilities, we thought--and we've been right so far--that we could add value by giving clients a one-stop inflation-hedging solution, and that's been getting a lot of traction both from defined-contribution plans as well as from institutional defined-benefit plans. So our three big product initiatives have been the Global Advantage suite of inflation-linked bond [funds], which includes emerging markets; more active management in commodities; and then finally the multi-asset real return solution.

What are the risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Templeton Global Bond Fund
Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time, and can reduce returns. Derivatives, including currency management strategies, involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses (as well as enable gains) on an amount that exceeds the fund's initial investment. The fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised. The markets for particular securities or types of securities are or may become relatively illiquid. Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the security's value and on the fund's ability to sell such securities when necessary to meet the fund's liquidity needs or in response to a specific market event. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and economic and political uncertainties. Investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets' smaller size and lesser liquidity. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Changes in interest rates will affect the value of the fund's portfolio and its share price and yield. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. The fund is also non-diversified, which involves the risk of greater price fluctuation than a more diversified portfolio. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value.

Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations (which may be significant over the short term) and economic and political uncertainties; investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors. Sovereign debt securities are subject to various risks in addition to those relating to debt securities and foreign securities generally, including, but not limited to, the risk that a government entity may be unwilling or unable to pay interest and repay principal on its sovereign debt, or otherwise meet its obligations when due. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the funds' prospectus.
For more information on any funds, contact your financial advisor or download a prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund’s investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.

What Are the Risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. Thus, as the prices of bonds adjust to a rise in interest rates, the share price may decline. Investments in foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments. Investments in emerging market countries involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets’ smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Such investments could experience significant price volatility in any given year. High yields reflect the higher credit risk associated with these lower-rated securities and, in some cases, the lower market prices for these instruments. Interest rate movements may affect the share price and yield. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Treasuries, if held to maturity, offer a fixed rate of return and fixed principal value; their interest payments and principal are guaranteed.

Global Macro Shifts











WHAT IS GLOBAL MACRO SHIFTS?


Global Macro Shifts is a research-based briefing on global economies featuring the analysis and views of Dr. Michael Hasenstab and senior members of Templeton Global Macro.

Recently, the potential for US corporate tax reform and a border adjustment tax (BAT) stirred debate not only within the US government but also among global investors. Templeton Global Macro examines how a BAT would work, its likely effect on prices and exchange rates, its implications for the longer-term macroeconomic outlook, its impact on different domestic sectors and trade flows, and the potential ramifications for international trade relations.​
