Our net proceeds from the sale of 13,250,000 shares of common stock in this 
offering are estimated to be $171.0 million, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering as follows: (i) approximately $71.8 million will
be used to repay borrowings outstanding under our term loan, (ii) approximately
$63.6 million will be used to fund the purchase of additional hydraulic 
fracturing units; and (iii) approximately $35.6 million will be retained for
general corporate purposes.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common
stock by the selling shareholders. We will pay all expenses related to this
offering, other than underwriting discounts and commissions related to the
shares sold by the selling shareholders.

The following table illustrates our anticipated use of the net proceeds from 
this offering:

As of January 31, 2017, we had $71.8 million of outstanding borrowings under our
term loan. The term loan matures on September 30, 2019 and requires quarterly
principal and interest payments. Our term loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR
plus 6.25% and is subject to a 1% floor. The outstanding borrowings under our
term loan were incurred primarily to fund a portion of our 2015 and 2016 capital
expenditures. In connection with the completion of this offering, we expect to
repay our term loan in full and terminate our term loan.


The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, an
oilfield services company must provide services that meet the specific needs of
oil and natural gas exploration and production companies at competitive prices.
Competitive factors impacting sales of our services are price, reputation and
technical expertise, service and equipment quality, and health and safety
standards. Although we believe our customers consider all of these factors, we
believe price is a key factor in E&P companies' criteria in choosing a service
provider. While we seek to price our services competitively, we believe many of
our customers elect to work with us based on our deep local roots, operational
expertise, equipment's ability to handle the most complex Permian Basin well
completions, and commitment to safety and reliability. 

We provide our services primarily in the Permian Basin, and we compete against
different companies in each service and product line we offer. Our competition
includes many large and small oilfield service companies, including the largest
integrated oilfield services companies. Our major competitors for hydraulic
fracturing services, which make up the majority of revenues, include C&J Energy
Services, Halliburton, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., RPC, Inc., Schlumberger,
Superior Energy Services and a number of locally oriented businesses.


Company Description
We are a growth-oriented, Midland, Texas-based oilfield services company 
providing hydraulic fracturing and other complementary services to leading 
upstream oil and gas companies engaged in the exploration and production, or 
E&P, of North American unconventional oil and natural gas resources.


 Our 
operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin, where we have cultivated
longstanding customer relationships with some of the region's most active and
well-capitalized E&P companies, including Callon Petroleum, Diamondback Energy,
Parsley Energy, Pioneer Natural Resources, Surge Energy and XTO Energy. For the
year ended December 31, 2016, no single customer represented greater than 20% of
our revenue. The Permian Basin is widely regarded as the most prolific 
oil-producing area in the United States, and we believe we are currently the
largest private provider of hydraulic fracturing services in the region by
hydraulic horsepower, or HHP, with an aggregate deployed capacity of 420,000 
HHP. Our fleet, which consists of 10 hydraulic fracturing units, has been
designed to handle the highest intensity, most complex hydraulic fracturing 
jobs, and has been 100% utilized since September 2016. We have purchased two
additional hydraulic fracturing units, which are scheduled for delivery and
deployment to dedicated customers in April and June 2017, respectively. These
units will provide us with an additional 90,000 HHP, bringing our total capacity
to 510,000 HHP. Additionally, we expect to use the proceeds from this offering
to purchase two additional units that will be deployed in 2017 to meet specific
customer requests, giving us an additional 90,000 HHP, or 600,000 HHP in the
aggregate, once all units have been received.

Our modern hydraulic fracturing fleet has been designed to handle Permian Basin
specific operating conditions and the region's increasingly high-intensity well
completions, which are characterized by longer horizontal wellbores, more frac
stages per lateral and increasing amounts of proppant per well. Over 75% of our
fleet has been delivered over the past four years, and we have fully maintained 
our equipment throughout the recent industry downturn to ensure optimal
performance and reliability. In contrast, we believe many of our competitors
have deferred necessary maintenance capital spending throughout the downturn,
which we believe positions us to respond more quickly and reliably to customer
needs during the ongoing market recovery. 

In addition to our core hydraulic fracturing operations, we also offer a suite
of complementary well completion and production services, including cementing,
acidizing, coiled tubing, flowback services, Permian drilling and surface air
drilling. We believe these complementary services create operational
efficiencies for our customers and allow us to capture a greater portion of 
their capital spending across the lifecycle of an unconventional well. We 
believe that these complementary services should benefit from a continued 
industry recovery and that we are well positioned to continue expanding these
offerings in response to our customers' increasing service needs and spending
levels.

Our primary business objective is to serve as a strategic partner to our 
customers. We achieve this objective by providing reliable, high-quality 
services that are tailored to our customers' needs and synchronized with their
well development programs. This alignment assists our customers in optimizing
the long-term development of their unconventional resources. Over the past four
years, we have leveraged our strong Permian Basin relationships to grow our
installed HHP capacity by over four times and organically build our Permian
Basin cementing, coiled tubing and acidizing lines of business. Consistent with
past performance, we believe our substantial market presence will continue to
yield a variety of actionable growth opportunities allowing us to expand both
our hydraulic fracturing and complementary services going forward. To this end,
we intend to continue our past practice of opportunistically deploying new
equipment on a long-term, dedicated basis in response to specific customer
demand.
