History[edit]
In 1999 DaVita was known as Total Renal Care (TRC), a dialysis company on the brink of bankruptcy. That year, Kent Thiry joined TRC as CEO and the company was restructured and renamed DaVita.[3][4] DaVita was featured as a Harvard Business School case.[5]
Since then, the company has grown significantly, reaching 230 on the Fortune 500 as of 2014.[6] DaVita acquired Gambro's U.S.-based clinics in 2004.[7] The merger doubled the number of DaVita’s outpatient facilities, combining DaVita's 664 clinics with Gambro Healthcare's 565 clinics.[8] DaVita operates or provides administrative services at more than 2,300 dialysis facilities and domestically employs more than 41,000 people.[9]
In 2012, DaVita acquired Healthcare Partners, an owner of physician groups based in California.[10]
Subsidiaries and acquisitions[edit]

2016: Acquired The Everett Clinic, based in Everett, Washington, for $405 million[11]

Relocation[edit]
In May 2009, DaVita announced it would move its corporate headquarters from El Segundo, California, to Denver.[12] A temporary headquarters that houses more than 300 DaVita employees was leased at 1551 Wewatta Street in Denver’s Lower Downtown (LoDo, Denver) district. In July 2010, DaVita announced it would be building its permanent headquarters adjacent to the Denver Millennium Bridge in LoDo. The new 270,000-square-foot building was completed in 2012 and can house upwards of 900 employees.[12] To accommodate growth while awaiting its new headquarters, DaVita leased a second temporary workspace on 16th Street and Market Street in June 2011.[13]
DaVita chose to relocate to Denver for a variety of reasons including the city’s central location, diverse talent pool, accessibility to mass transit, affordable cost of living, welcoming community and outstanding quality of life. According to company chairman Kent Thiry, “DaVita was looking for two equally important things in its new home. Number one, that we find an environment that was good for the company to pursue its business. Number two, that we find an environment where our people could live great lives.[13]”
DaVita currently employs approximately 1,000 employees in Colorado, more than 700 of whom work in the Metro Denver area.[14]
In late 2015 DaVita announced it was expanding into and would be the primary tenant within a new 19-story office building, to be called 16 Chestnut, directly across 16th Street from the current headquarters. Groundbreaking for 16 Chestnut occurred in June 2016 with a completion anticipated for mid to late 2018.
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Sustainability[edit]
DaVita has initiated several sustainability programs to reduce the company footprint, and was the only kidney care company recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its sustainability initiatives.[15] In 2010, DaVita opened the first LEED-certified dialysis center in the U.S., and is currently seeking LEED Gold certification for its new headquarters being built in Denver.
In 2010 DaVita installed solar thermal technology as a trial at one facility in Scottsburg, Indiana Initial analysis of the trial showed a 75 percent reduction in natural gas consumption versus comparable DaVita facilities in the region.[16]
Dialyzer components are made entirely from crude oil, and the non-degradable parts comprise more than 60 million pounds of medical waste annually.[17] Though dialyzer reuse has sparked a controversy in the dialysis industry,[18] DaVita continues to allow patients to choose either single-use dialyzers or reuse, which is estimated to save 8.5 million pounds of medical waste annually.[17]
DaVita also launched a dialyzer recycling pilot with Waste Management, Inc and Becton Dickinson, believed to be the first program of this type.[19]
Community Outreach[edit]
DaVita works in conjunction with many organizations to raise awareness of chronic kidney disease. DaVita has supported The Kidney TRUST to provide more than 15,000 kidney screenings as part of The Kidney TRUST’s CKD rapid-testing program.[17] The early detection of kidney disease can delay the onset of dialysis and improve the quality of life for patients.
DaVita Kidney Rock[edit]
The DaVita Kidney Rock is a 5K run walk event that raises awareness of chronic kidney disease and funds in support of this cause. The 2011 DaVita Kidney Rock was held in Denver’s City Park and featured complimentary kidney disease screenings for participants by The Kidney TRUST; a health fair; and games and prizes in the Kids Zone.[20]
Tour DaVita[edit]
Tour DaVita is an annual three-day, 250-mile bike ride to raise awareness of and funds for the fight against kidney disease. The fifth annual Tour DaVita was held Sept. 17 – Sept. 20 in Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut. In 2011, Tour DaVita raised $700,000 for the Kidney TRUST.[21]
Village Service Days[edit]
DaVita teammates engage in Village Service Days by making a positive difference in their local communities. Village Service Days include volunteer activities where DaVita teammates support the work of various local 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations.
The Kidney TRUST[edit]
The Kidney TRUST was founded in 2006 by DaVita. It is an independent, nonprofit organization that believes everyone should be empowered to take a proactive role in their health. The Kidney TRUST is seeking to reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) through free, rapid screening in non-medical settings and providing financial assistance to people affected
Bridge of Life - DaVita Medical Missions[edit]
Bridge of Life—DaVita Medical Missions is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded by DaVita that provides treatment, education and care to CKD patients in developing countries. Bridge of Life has completed 18 missions, bringing dialysis services to Cameroon, India, Ecuador, Guatemala and the Philippines.[22]

Controversies[edit]
Department of Justice Lawsuit[edit]
In October 2014 the US Department of Justice announced that DaVita agreed to pay the government $350 million to settle a False Claims Act lawsuit that alleged that DaVita paid kickbacks to receive referrals of patients to its dialysis clinics.[36] DaVita agreed to pay another $39 million in a civil forfeiture related to two specific joint ventures in Denver. As part of the settlement DaVita was required to divest itself of joint ventures and submit to monitoring. The lawsuit alleged that for almost a decade DaVita sought out doctors with a large number of patients with renal disease and offered lucrative joint venture opportunities, violating the state and federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
A whistleblower (qui tam) lawsuit was brought by David Barbetta, a former DaVita employee. The whistleblower lawsuit, which was filed in 2007, remained under seal for more than three years while the government reviewed the claims. In April 2011, U.S. Attorney Sally Yates informed the parties that the government had declined to join the case. The lawsuit alleges that the protocol for Zemplar allowed for only 2 mg vials of the vitamin D supplement to be used when the prescribed dose was 2 mg or less. But if the prescribed dose was 6 mg, for example, a 10 mg vial — not three 2 mg vials — was to be used, with 4 mg being wasted, the suit said. The suit said if DaVita followed certain sterilization safeguards, the unused medication in the Venofer vials could be used for other patients. The company followed such procedures when using the far more expensive drug Epogen during much of the same time, the suit said. In a statement, DaVita acknowledged that such a practice — called re-entry — was allowed as an option to health-care providers by the government between 2002 and 2008. But since 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have banned it. The agencies have warned that any potential cost savings from allowing multiple syringe draws from a single vial are outweighed by the possible risk of infection.[37]
On November 30, 2012 CNN Health ran a story about accusations of large scale Medicare/Medicaid fraud made against DaVita.[38]
Dialysis Insurance Steering[edit]
In October 2016, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported that DaVita had been steering low income dialysis patients to purchase unneeded private medical insurance.[39] Patients were told their private insurance premiums would be subsidized by the American Kidney Fund at no cost to the patient. While providing the same service, dialysis covered by private insurance is much more profitable for DaVita due to lower rates of reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. The American Kidney Fund subsequently introduced new measures to ensure patients applying for support truly need private insurance, rather than using Medicare or Medicaid.[40]

Since then, the company has grown significantly, reaching 230 on the Fortune 500 as of 2014.[6] DaVita acquired Gambro's U.S.-based clinics in 2004.[7] The merger doubled the number of DaVita’s outpatient facilities, combining DaVita's 664 clinics with Gambro Healthcare's 565 clinics.[8] DaVita operates or provides administrative services at more than 2,300 dialysis facilities and domestically employs more than 41,000 people.[9]
In 2012, DaVita acquired Healthcare Partners, an owner of physician groups based in California.[10]
Subsidiaries and acquisitions[edit]

2016: Acquired The Everett Clinic, based in Everett, Washington, for $405 million[11]

Relocation[edit]
In May 2009, DaVita announced it would move its corporate headquarters from El Segundo, California, to Denver.[12] A temporary headquarters that houses more than 300 DaVita employees was leased at 1551 Wewatta Street in Denver’s Lower Downtown (LoDo, Denver) district. In July 2010, DaVita announced it would be building its permanent headquarters adjacent to the Denver Millennium Bridge in LoDo. The new 270,000-square-foot building was completed in 2012 and can house upwards of 900 employees.[12] To accommodate growth while awaiting its new headquarters, DaVita leased a second temporary workspace on 16th Street and Market Street in June 2011.[13]
DaVita chose to relocate to Denver for a variety of reasons including the city’s central location, diverse talent pool, accessibility to mass transit, affordable cost of living, welcoming community and outstanding quality of life. According to company chairman Kent Thiry, “DaVita was looking for two equally important things in its new home. Number one, that we find an environment that was good for the company to pursue its business. Number two, that we find an environment where our people could live great lives.[13]”
DaVita currently employs approximately 1,000 employees in Colorado, more than 700 of whom work in the Metro Denver area.[14]
In late 2015 DaVita announced it was expanding into and would be the primary tenant within a new 19-story office building, to be called 16 Chestnut, directly across 16th Street from the current headquarters. Groundbreaking for 16 Chestnut occurred in June 2016 with a completion anticipated for mid to late 2018.
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Sustainability[edit]
DaVita has initiated several sustainability programs to reduce the company footprint, and was the only kidney care company recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its sustainability initiatives.[15] In 2010, DaVita opened the first LEED-certified dialysis center in the U.S., and is currently seeking LEED Gold certification for its new headquarters being built in Denver.
In 2010 DaVita installed solar thermal technology as a trial at one facility in Scottsburg, Indiana Initial analysis of the trial showed a 75 percent reduction in natural gas consumption versus comparable DaVita facilities in the region.[16]
Dialyzer components are made entirely from crude oil, and the non-degradable parts comprise more than 60 million pounds of medical waste annually.[17] Though dialyzer reuse has sparked a controversy in the dialysis industry,[18] DaVita continues to allow patients to choose either single-use dialyzers or reuse, which is estimated to save 8.5 million pounds of medical waste annually.[17]
DaVita also launched a dialyzer recycling pilot with Waste Management, Inc and Becton Dickinson, believed to be the first program of this type.[19]
Community Outreach[edit]
DaVita works in conjunction with many organizations to raise awareness of chronic kidney disease. DaVita has supported The Kidney TRUST to provide more than 15,000 kidney screenings as part of The Kidney TRUST’s CKD rapid-testing program.[17] The early detection of kidney disease can delay the onset of dialysis and improve the quality of life for patients.
DaVita Kidney Rock[edit]
The DaVita Kidney Rock is a 5K run walk event that raises awareness of chronic kidney disease and funds in support of this cause. The 2011 DaVita Kidney Rock was held in Denver’s City Park and featured complimentary kidney disease screenings for participants by The Kidney TRUST; a health fair; and games and prizes in the Kids Zone.[20]
Tour DaVita[edit]
Tour DaVita is an annual three-day, 250-mile bike ride to raise awareness of and funds for the fight against kidney disease. The fifth annual Tour DaVita was held Sept. 17 – Sept. 20 in Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut. In 2011, Tour DaVita raised $700,000 for the Kidney TRUST.[21]
Village Service Days[edit]
DaVita teammates engage in Village Service Days by making a positive difference in their local communities. Village Service Days include volunteer activities where DaVita teammates support the work of various local 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations.
The Kidney TRUST[edit]
The Kidney TRUST was founded in 2006 by DaVita. It is an independent, nonprofit organization that believes everyone should be empowered to take a proactive role in their health. The Kidney TRUST is seeking to reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) through free, rapid screening in non-medical settings and providing financial assistance to people affected
Bridge of Life - DaVita Medical Missions[edit]
Bridge of Life—DaVita Medical Missions is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded by DaVita that provides treatment, education and care to CKD patients in developing countries.

Controversies[edit]
Department of Justice Lawsuit[edit]
In October 2014 the US Department of Justice announced that DaVita agreed to pay the government $350 million to settle a False Claims Act lawsuit that alleged that DaVita paid kickbacks to receive referrals of patients to its dialysis clinics.[36] DaVita agreed to pay another $39 million in a civil forfeiture related to two specific joint ventures in Denver. As part of the settlement DaVita was required to divest itself of joint ventures and submit to monitoring. The lawsuit alleged that for almost a decade DaVita sought out doctors with a large number of patients with renal disease and offered lucrative joint venture opportunities, violating the state and federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
A whistleblower (qui tam) lawsuit was brought by David Barbetta, a former DaVita employee. The whistleblower lawsuit, which was filed in 2007, remained under seal for more than three years while the government reviewed the claims. In April 2011, U.S. Attorney Sally Yates informed the parties that the government had declined to join the case. The lawsuit alleges that the protocol for Zemplar allowed for only 2 mg vials of the vitamin D supplement to be used when the prescribed dose was 2 mg or less. But if the prescribed dose was 6 mg, for example, a 10 mg vial — not three 2 mg vials — was to be used, with 4 mg being wasted, the suit said. The suit said if DaVita followed certain sterilization safeguards, the unused medication in the Venofer vials could be used for other patients. The company followed such procedures when using the far more expensive drug Epogen during much of the same time, the suit said. In a statement, DaVita acknowledged that such a practice — called re-entry — was allowed as an option to health-care providers by the government between 2002 and 2008. But since 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have banned it. The agencies have warned that any potential cost savings from allowing multiple syringe draws from a single vial are outweighed by the possible risk of infection.[37]
On November 30, 2012 CNN Health ran a story about accusations of large scale Medicare/Medicaid fraud made against DaVita.[38]
Dialysis Insurance Steering[edit]
In October 2016, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported that DaVita had been steering low income dialysis patients to purchase unneeded private medical insurance.[39] Patients were told their private insurance premiums would be subsidized by the American Kidney Fund at no cost to the patient. While providing the same service, dialysis covered by private insurance is much more profitable for DaVita due to lower rates of reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. The American Kidney Fund subsequently introduced new measures to ensure patients applying for support truly need private insurance, rather than using Medicare or Medicaid.[40]

History[edit]
In 1999 DaVita was known as Total Renal Care (TRC), a dialysis company on the brink of bankruptcy. That year, Kent Thiry joined TRC as CEO and the company was restructured and renamed DaVita.[3][4] DaVita was featured as a Harvard Business School case.[5]
Since then, the company has grown significantly, reaching 230 on the Fortune 500 as of 2014.[6] DaVita acquired Gambro's U.S.-based clinics in 2004.[7] The merger doubled the number of DaVita’s outpatient facilities, combining DaVita's 664 clinics with Gambro Healthcare's 565 clinics.[8] DaVita operates or provides administrative services at more than 2,300 dialysis facilities and domestically employs more than 41,000 people.[9]
In 2012, DaVita acquired Healthcare Partners, an owner of physician groups based in California.[10]
Subsidiaries and acquisitions[edit]

2016: Acquired The Everett Clinic, based in Everett, Washington, for $405 million[11]

Relocation[edit]
In May 2009, DaVita announced it would move its corporate headquarters from El Segundo, California, to Denver.[12] A temporary headquarters that houses more than 300 DaVita employees was leased at 1551 Wewatta Street in Denver’s Lower Downtown (LoDo, Denver) district. In July 2010, DaVita announced it would be building its permanent headquarters adjacent to the Denver Millennium Bridge in LoDo. The new 270,000-square-foot building was completed in 2012 and can house upwards of 900 employees.[12] To accommodate growth while awaiting its new headquarters, DaVita leased a second temporary workspace on 16th Street and Market Street in June 2011.[13]
DaVita chose to relocate to Denver for a variety of reasons including the city’s central location, diverse talent pool, accessibility to mass transit, affordable cost of living, welcoming community and outstanding quality of life. According to company chairman Kent Thiry, “DaVita was looking for two equally important things in its new home. Number one, that we find an environment that was good for the company to pursue its business. Number two, that we find an environment where our people could live great lives.[13]”
DaVita currently employs approximately 1,000 employees in Colorado, more than 700 of whom work in the Metro Denver area.[14]
In late 2015 DaVita announced it was expanding into and would be the primary tenant within a new 19-story office building, to be called 16 Chestnut, directly across 16th Street from the current headquarters. Groundbreaking for 16 Chestnut occurred in June 2016 with a completion anticipated for mid to late 2018.
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Sustainability[edit]
DaVita has initiated several sustainability programs to reduce the company footprint, and was the only kidney care company recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its sustainability initiatives.[15] In 2010, DaVita opened the first LEED-certified dialysis center in the U.S., and is currently seeking LEED Gold certification for its new headquarters being built in Denver.
In 2010 DaVita installed solar thermal technology as a trial at one facility in Scottsburg, Indiana Initial analysis of the trial showed a 75 percent reduction in natural gas consumption versus comparable DaVita facilities in the region.[16]
Dialyzer components are made entirely from crude oil, and the non-degradable parts comprise more than 60 million pounds of medical waste annually.[17] Though dialyzer reuse has sparked a controversy in the dialysis industry,[18] DaVita continues to allow patients to choose either single-use dialyzers or reuse, which is estimated to save 8.5 million pounds of medical waste annually.[17]
DaVita also launched a dialyzer recycling pilot with Waste Management, Inc and Becton Dickinson, believed to be the first program of this type.[19]
Community Outreach[edit]
DaVita works in conjunction with many organizations to raise awareness of chronic kidney disease. DaVita has supported The Kidney TRUST to provide more than 15,000 kidney screenings as part of The Kidney TRUST’s CKD rapid-testing program.[17] The early detection of kidney disease can delay the onset of dialysis and improve the quality of life for patients.
DaVita Kidney Rock[edit]
The DaVita Kidney Rock is a 5K run walk event that raises awareness of chronic kidney disease and funds in support of this cause. The 2011 DaVita Kidney Rock was held in Denver’s City Park and featured complimentary kidney disease screenings for participants by The Kidney TRUST; a health fair; and games and prizes in the Kids Zone.[20]
Tour DaVita[edit]
Tour DaVita is an annual three-day, 250-mile bike ride to raise awareness of and funds for the fight against kidney disease. The fifth annual Tour DaVita was held Sept. 17 – Sept. 20 in Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut. In 2011, Tour DaVita raised $700,000 for the Kidney TRUST.[21]
Village Service Days[edit]
DaVita teammates engage in Village Service Days by making a positive difference in their local communities. Village Service Days include volunteer activities where DaVita teammates support the work of various local 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations.
The Kidney TRUST[edit]
The Kidney TRUST was founded in 2006 by DaVita. It is an independent, nonprofit organization that believes everyone should be empowered to take a proactive role in their health. The Kidney TRUST is seeking to reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) through free, rapid screening in non-medical settings and providing financial assistance to people affected
Bridge of Life - DaVita Medical Missions[edit]
Bridge of Life—DaVita Medical Missions is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded by DaVita that provides treatment, education and care to CKD patients in developing countries. Bridge of Life has completed 18 missions, bringing dialysis services to Cameroon, India, Ecuador, Guatemala and the Philippines.[22]

Controversies[edit]
Department of Justice Lawsuit[edit]
In October 2014 the US Department of Justice announced that DaVita agreed to pay the government $350 million to settle a False Claims Act lawsuit that alleged that DaVita paid kickbacks to receive referrals of patients to its dialysis clinics.[36] DaVita agreed to pay another $39 million in a civil forfeiture related to two specific joint ventures in Denver. As part of the settlement DaVita was required to divest itself of joint ventures and submit to monitoring. The lawsuit alleged that for almost a decade DaVita sought out doctors with a large number of patients with renal disease and offered lucrative joint venture opportunities, violating the state and federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
A whistleblower (qui tam) lawsuit was brought by David Barbetta, a former DaVita employee. The whistleblower lawsuit, which was filed in 2007, remained under seal for more than three years while the government reviewed the claims. In April 2011, U.S. Attorney Sally Yates informed the parties that the government had declined to join the case. The lawsuit alleges that the protocol for Zemplar allowed for only 2 mg vials of the vitamin D supplement to be used when the prescribed dose was 2 mg or less. But if the prescribed dose was 6 mg, for example, a 10 mg vial — not three 2 mg vials — was to be used, with 4 mg being wasted, the suit said. The suit said if DaVita followed certain sterilization safeguards, the unused medication in the Venofer vials could be used for other patients. The company followed such procedures when using the far more expensive drug Epogen during much of the same time, the suit said. In a statement, DaVita acknowledged that such a practice — called re-entry — was allowed as an option to health-care providers by the government between 2002 and 2008. But since 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have banned it. The agencies have warned that any potential cost savings from allowing multiple syringe draws from a single vial are outweighed by the possible risk of infection.[37]
On November 30, 2012 CNN Health ran a story about accusations of large scale Medicare/Medicaid fraud made against DaVita.[38]
Dialysis Insurance Steering[edit]
In October 2016, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported that DaVita had been steering low income dialysis patients to purchase unneeded private medical insurance.[39] Patients were told their private insurance premiums would be subsidized by the American Kidney Fund at no cost to the patient. While providing the same service, dialysis covered by private insurance is much more profitable for DaVita due to lower rates of reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. The American Kidney Fund subsequently introduced new measures to ensure patients applying for support truly need private insurance, rather than using Medicare or Medicaid.[40]

In 1999 DaVita was known as Total Renal Care (TRC), a dialysis company on the brink of bankruptcy. That year, Kent Thiry joined TRC as CEO and the company was restructured and renamed DaVita.[3][4] DaVita was featured as a Harvard Business School case.[5]
Since then, the company has grown significantly, reaching 230 on the Fortune 500 as of 2014.[6] DaVita acquired Gambro's U.S.-based clinics in 2004.[7] The merger doubled the number of DaVita’s outpatient facilities, combining DaVita's 664 clinics with Gambro Healthcare's 565 clinics.[8] DaVita operates or provides administrative services at more than 2,300 dialysis facilities and domestically employs more than 41,000 people.[9]
In 2012, DaVita acquired Healthcare Partners, an owner of physician groups based in California.[10]
Subsidiaries and acquisitions[edit]

2016: Acquired The Everett Clinic, based in Everett, Washington, for $405 million[11]

Relocation[edit]
In May 2009, DaVita announced it would move its corporate headquarters from El Segundo, California, to Denver.[12] A temporary headquarters that houses more than 300 DaVita employees was leased at 1551 Wewatta Street in Denver’s Lower Downtown (LoDo, Denver) district. In July 2010, DaVita announced it would be building its permanent headquarters adjacent to the Denver Millennium Bridge in LoDo. The new 270,000-square-foot building was completed in 2012 and can house upwards of 900 employees.[12] To accommodate growth while awaiting its new headquarters, DaVita leased a second temporary workspace on 16th Street and Market Street in June 2011.[13]
DaVita chose to relocate to Denver for a variety of reasons including the city’s central location, diverse talent pool, accessibility to mass transit, affordable cost of living, welcoming community and outstanding quality of life. According to company chairman Kent Thiry, “DaVita was looking for two equally important things in its new home. Number one, that we find an environment that was good for the company to pursue its business. Number two, that we find an environment where our people could live great lives.[13]”
DaVita currently employs approximately 1,000 employees in Colorado, more than 700 of whom work in the Metro Denver area.[14]
In late 2015 DaVita announced it was expanding into and would be the primary tenant within a new 19-story office building, to be called 16 Chestnut, directly across 16th Street from the current headquarters. Groundbreaking for 16 Chestnut occurred in June 2016 with a completion anticipated for mid to late 2018.
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Sustainability[edit]
DaVita has initiated several sustainability programs to reduce the company footprint, and was the only kidney care company recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its sustainability initiatives.[15] In 2010, DaVita opened the first LEED-certified dialysis center in the U.S., and is currently seeking LEED Gold certification for its new headquarters being built in Denver.
In 2010 DaVita installed solar thermal technology as a trial at one facility in Scottsburg, Indiana Initial analysis of the trial showed a 75 percent reduction in natural gas consumption versus comparable DaVita facilities in the region.[16]
Dialyzer components are made entirely from crude oil, and the non-degradable parts comprise more than 60 million pounds of medical waste annually.[17] Though dialyzer reuse has sparked a controversy in the dialysis industry,[18] DaVita continues to allow patients to choose either single-use dialyzers or reuse, which is estimated to save 8.5 million pounds of medical waste annually.[17]
DaVita also launched a dialyzer recycling pilot with Waste Management, Inc and Becton Dickinson, believed to be the first program of this type.[19]
Community Outreach[edit]
DaVita works in conjunction with many organizations to raise awareness of chronic kidney disease. DaVita has supported The Kidney TRUST to provide more than 15,000 kidney screenings as part of The Kidney TRUST’s CKD rapid-testing program.[17] The early detection of kidney disease can delay the onset of dialysis and improve the quality of life for patients.
DaVita Kidney Rock[edit]
The DaVita Kidney Rock is a 5K run walk event that raises awareness of chronic kidney disease and funds in support of this cause. The 2011 DaVita Kidney Rock was held in Denver’s City Park and featured complimentary kidney disease screenings for participants by The Kidney TRUST; a health fair; and games and prizes in the Kids Zone.[20]
Tour DaVita[edit]
Tour DaVita is an annual three-day, 250-mile bike ride to raise awareness of and funds for the fight against kidney disease. The fifth annual Tour DaVita was held Sept. 17 – Sept. 20 in Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut. In 2011, Tour DaVita raised $700,000 for the Kidney TRUST.[21]
Village Service Days[edit]
DaVita teammates engage in Village Service Days by making a positive difference in their local communities. Village Service Days include volunteer activities where DaVita teammates support the work of various local 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations.
The Kidney TRUST[edit]
The Kidney TRUST was founded in 2006 by DaVita. It is an independent, nonprofit organization that believes everyone should be empowered to take a proactive role in their health. The Kidney TRUST is seeking to reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) through free, rapid screening in non-medical settings and providing financial assistance to people affected
Bridge of Life - DaVita Medical Missions[edit]
Bridge of Life—DaVita Medical Missions is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded by DaVita that provides treatment, education and care to CKD patients in developing countries. Bridge of Life has completed 18 missions, bringing dialysis services to Cameroon, India, Ecuador, Guatemala and the Philippines.[22]

Controversies[edit]
Department of Justice Lawsuit[edit]
In October 2014 the US Department of Justice announced that DaVita agreed to pay the government $350 million to settle a False Claims Act lawsuit that alleged that DaVita paid kickbacks to receive referrals of patients to its dialysis clinics.[36] DaVita agreed to pay another $39 million in a civil forfeiture related to two specific joint ventures in Denver. As part of the settlement DaVita was required to divest itself of joint ventures and submit to monitoring. The lawsuit alleged that for almost a decade DaVita sought out doctors with a large number of patients with renal disease and offered lucrative joint venture opportunities, violating the state and federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
A whistleblower (qui tam) lawsuit was brought by David Barbetta, a former DaVita employee. The whistleblower lawsuit, which was filed in 2007, remained under seal for more than three years while the government reviewed the claims. In April 2011, U.S. Attorney Sally Yates informed the parties that the government had declined to join the case. The lawsuit alleges that the protocol for Zemplar allowed for only 2 mg vials of the vitamin D supplement to be used when the prescribed dose was 2 mg or less. But if the prescribed dose was 6 mg, for example, a 10 mg vial — not three 2 mg vials — was to be used, with 4 mg being wasted, the suit said. The suit said if DaVita followed certain sterilization safeguards, the unused medication in the Venofer vials could be used for other patients. The company followed such procedures when using the far more expensive drug Epogen during much of the same time, the suit said. In a statement, DaVita acknowledged that such a practice — called re-entry — was allowed as an option to health-care providers by the government between 2002 and 2008. But since 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have banned it. The agencies have warned that any potential cost savings from allowing multiple syringe draws from a single vial are outweighed by the possible risk of infection.[37]
On November 30, 2012 CNN Health ran a story about accusations of large scale Medicare/Medicaid fraud made against DaVita.[38]
Dialysis Insurance Steering[edit]
In October 2016, the St. Louis Post Dispatch reported that DaVita had been steering low income dialysis patients to purchase unneeded private medical insurance.[39] Patients were told their private insurance premiums would be subsidized by the American Kidney Fund at no cost to the patient. While providing the same service, dialysis covered by private insurance is much more profitable for DaVita due to lower rates of reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. The American Kidney Fund subsequently introduced new measures to ensure patients applying for support truly need private insurance, rather than using Medicare or Medicaid.[40]

History[edit]
In 1999 DaVita was known as Total Renal Care (TRC), a dialysis company on the brink of bankruptcy. That year, Kent Thiry joined TRC as CEO and the company was restructured and renamed DaVita.[3][4] DaVita was featured as a Harvard Business School case.[5]
Since then, the company has grown significantly, reaching 230 on the Fortune 500 as of 2014.[6] DaVita acquired Gambro's U.S.-based clinics in 2004.[7] The merger doubled the number of DaVita’s outpatient facilities, combining DaVita's 664 clinics with Gambro Healthcare's 565 clinics.[8] DaVita operates or provides administrative services at more than 2,300 dialysis facilities and domestically employs more than 41,000 people.[9]
In 2012, DaVita acquired Healthcare Partners, an owner of physician groups based in California.[10]
Subsidiaries and acquisitions[edit]

2016: Acquired The Everett Clinic, based in Everett, Washington, for $405 million[11]

Relocation[edit]
In May 2009, DaVita announced it would move its corporate headquarters from El Segundo, California, to Denver.[12] A temporary headquarters that houses more than 300 DaVita employees was leased at 1551 Wewatta Street in Denver’s Lower Downtown (LoDo, Denver) district. In July 2010, DaVita announced it would be building its permanent headquarters adjacent to the Denver Millennium Bridge in LoDo. The new 270,000-square-foot building was completed in 2012 and can house upwards of 900 employees.[12] To accommodate growth while awaiting its new headquarters, DaVita leased a second temporary workspace on 16th Street and Market Street in June 2011.[13]
DaVita chose to relocate to Denver for a variety of reasons including the city’s central location, diverse talent pool, accessibility to mass transit, affordable cost of living, welcoming community and outstanding quality of life. According to company chairman Kent Thiry, “DaVita was looking for two equally important things in its new home. Number one, that we find an environment that was good for the company to pursue its business. Number two, that we find an environment where our people could live great lives.[13]”
DaVita currently employs approximately 1,000 employees in Colorado, more than 700 of whom work in the Metro Denver area.[14]
In late 2015 DaVita announced it was expanding into and would be the primary tenant within a new 19-story office building, to be called 16 Chestnut, directly across 16th Street from the current headquarters. Groundbreaking for 16 Chestnut occurred in June 2016 with a completion anticipated for mid to late 2018.
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Sustainability[edit]
DaVita has initiated several sustainability programs to reduce the company footprint, and was the only kidney care company recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its sustainability initiatives.[15] In 2010, DaVita opened the first LEED-certified dialysis center in the U.S., and is currently seeking LEED Gold certification for its new headquarters being built in Denver.
In 2010 DaVita installed solar thermal technology as a trial at one facility in Scottsburg, Indiana Initial analysis of the trial showed a 75 percent reduction in natural gas consumption versus comparable DaVita facilities in the region.[16]
Dialyzer components are made entirely from crude oil, and the non-degradable parts comprise more than 60 million pounds of medical waste annually.[17] Though dialyzer reuse has sparked a controversy in the dialysis industry,[18] DaVita continues to allow patients to choose either single-use dialyzers or reuse, which is estimated to save 8.5 million pounds of medical waste annually.[17]
DaVita also launched a dialyzer recycling pilot with Waste Management, Inc and Becton Dickinson, believed to be the first program of this type.[19]
Community Outreach[edit]
DaVita works in conjunction with many organizations to raise awareness of chronic kidney disease. DaVita has supported The Kidney TRUST to provide more than 15,000 kidney screenings as part of The Kidney TRUST’s CKD rapid-testing program.[17] The early detection of kidney disease can delay the onset of dialysis and improve the quality of life for patients.
DaVita Kidney Rock[edit]
The DaVita Kidney Rock is a 5K run walk event that raises awareness of chronic kidney disease and funds in support of this cause. The 2011 DaVita Kidney Rock was held in Denver’s City Park and featured complimentary kidney disease screenings for participants by The Kidney TRUST; a health fair; and games and prizes in the Kids Zone.[20]
Tour DaVita[edit]
Tour DaVita is an annual three-day, 250-mile bike ride to raise awareness of and funds for the fight against kidney disease. The fifth annual Tour DaVita was held Sept. 17 – Sept. 20 in Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut. In 2011, Tour DaVita raised $700,000 for the Kidney TRUST.[21]
Village Service Days[edit]
DaVita teammates engage in Village Service Days by making a positive difference in their local communities. Village Service Days include volunteer activities where DaVita teammates support the work of various local 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations.
The Kidney TRUST[edit]
The Kidney TRUST was founded in 2006 by DaVita. It is an independent, nonprofit organization that believes everyone should be empowered to take a proactive role in their health. The Kidney TRUST is seeking to reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) through free, rapid screening in non-medical settings and providing financial assistance to people affected
Bridge of Life - DaVita Medical Missions[edit]
Bridge of Life—DaVita Medical Missions is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded by DaVita that provides treatment, education and care to CKD patients in developing countries. Bridge of Life has completed 18 missions, bringing dialysis services to Cameroon, India, Ecuador, Guatemala and the Philippines.[22]

Controversies[edit]
Department of Justice Lawsuit[edit]
In October 2014 the US Department of Justice announced that DaVita agreed to pay the government $350 million to settle a False Claims Act lawsuit that alleged that DaVita paid kickbacks to receive referrals of patients to its dialysis clinics.[36] DaVita agreed to pay another $39 million in a civil forfeiture related to two specific joint ventures in Denver. As part of the settlement DaVita was required to divest itself of joint ventures and submit to monitoring. The lawsuit alleged that for almost a decade DaVita sought out doctors with a large number of patients with renal disease and offered lucrative joint venture opportunities, violating the state and federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.

DENVER, June 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- DaVita Inc. (NYSE:   DVA), a leading independent medical group and a leading, global provider of kidney care services, today announced it has formalized a new business, DaVita Health Solutions, to help care for the highest-risk, most clinically complex patients in the U.S. 








"We care for thousands of patients who suffer from multiple chronic conditions, experience frequent hospitalizations and require a fundamentally different care model," said Kent Thiry, chairman and CEO for DaVita. "While so many other companies are focused on solving one part of the problem, whether it be a single disease state like diabetes, palliative care or post-acute care alone, we now have an opportunity to deliver a comprehensive solution that is meant to better address what a patient with multiple chronic conditions needs to help optimize their care."
The DaVita Health Solutions care model expands primary care outside of the traditional doctor's office setting to meet patients when and where they need care most – in the home, at a post-acute skilled nursing facility (SNF), or within a dialysis center for patients who suffer from end stage renal disease (ESRD). 
DaVita Health Solutions offers a comprehensive care suite that includes: 

"House calls," meeting patients where they are: A physician-led program that provides primary care, behavioral health, palliative care, comprehensive wellness visits and complementary health care services to patients and their caregivers within the patient's home. 
Smoother transitions back home to families: A post-acute care program with employed SNFists who help patients experience smoother transitions home from a skilled nursing facility so they can spend more quality time with loved ones and may avoid return visits to the hospital. 
A dialysis center as the medical home: An integrated kidney care program that treats ESRD patients where they spend 12-15 hours per week and coordinates their care across doctors and specialists. 
24x7 support and coordinated care: A physician-led, interdisciplinary clinical care team comprised of physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, behavioral health and palliative care specialists, social workers, pharmacists and dietitians. 

"DaVita has a history of changing the way that health care is delivered," said Dr. Dinesh Kumar, senior vice president of DaVita Health Solutions. "Over 15 years, our comprehensive care programs in the patient's home, SNF and dialysis center have resulted in 30-40 percent fewer hospitalizations and a 50 percent reduction in SNF length of stay and readmission rate. As a result, our patients are able to spend more time at home with their families experiencing life's great joys."

Home Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)
Starting peritoneal dialysis (PD) can dramatically improve your health and should make you feel better. It has become the most common form of home dialysis treatment among patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD).  
Learn more »
Home Hemodialysis (HHD)

In-Center Nocturnal Dialysis
In-center nocturnal dialysis turns nonproductive sleep time
                        into hemodialysis treatment time, giving patients their daylight hours back. Patients receive hemodialysis in their dialysis center overnight for 6-8 hours while they sleep.

Diet and Nutrition: Food IQ for People with Kidney Disease
As kidney function declines, protein waste and minerals become hard to remove, and diseased kidneys must work harder to get rid of them. Each person’s kidney diet prescription is different, but the main nutrients limited in kidney diets include protein, phosphorus, potassium and sodium. Read on to enhance your kidney-friendly food IQ.
Wise up with water
Choose tap or plain bottled water, mineral water or flavored sparkling water. Specialty waters may be enhanced with sodium, potassium or phosphate additives.
Choose your brew
Home-brewed tea and homemade lemonade are ideal alternatives to water. Some bottled or canned beverages are loaded with phosphates, so it’s better to limit them.
Pick your poultry
Choose fresh poultry and pork. Many enhanced and pre-cooked products (including broth, nuggets and strips) contain greater amounts of sodium, phosphate and potassium additives.
Go organic
Make homemade low-sodium soup with organic or homemade stock.
Tap into your vegetarian side
Eat meatless meals or plan entrées that use modest amounts of meat to reduce protein and thus added stress on your kidneys. Meatless meals have fewer saturated fats to boot, which is good news for your heart.
Some cheese, please
Select strong-flavored natural cheesesand limit the amount you eat to 1-2 ounces to help decrease your intake of saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium and phosphorus.
“A” is for antioxidants
Eat antioxidant-richapples, berries, cherries, red grapes, cabbage, cauliflower, garlic, onions and red bell peppers to help decrease chronic inflammation associated with kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Power up with protein
Choose egg whites and high omega-3 fish as your protein source. Regardless of your protein level, plan at least half from high-quality sources such as these to receive all the essential amino acids. Egg whites are very low in phosphorus; fish such as salmon, trout and tuna reduce inflammation associated with kidney and heart disease.
Trim the fat
Replace unhealthy fats such as shortening, animal fats and hydrogenated margarine with healthy fats, such as olive oil and trans fat–free margarine.
Manage your diet with DaVita tools
Check out the kidney diet-related tools on DaVita.com. Diet Helper® makes it easy to plan, prepare and track kidney-friendly meals. And take the DaVita® Phosphorus Challenge, a tool that includes phosphorus education games, quizzes, polls, articles, videos, recipes and more.

What Stage Am I In?
There are five stages of kidney disease. Your glomerular filtration rate (GFR)–considered by medical professionals to be the best measure of kidney function–lets kidney care experts figure out your stage of kidney disease. Understanding it can help you learn how to take control and slow the progression of your condition. Determining your GFR levels requires a simple blood test. Use this GFR Calculator tool to help you determine which stage of kidney disease you are in currently.
What Your GFR Result Means
Completely healthy kidney function is measured at a GFR of around 100, which means that the kidneys are working at 100 percent. Your kidney function is still considered normal if the GFR number is 90 or greater. If your GFR is 45, you know that your kidneys are working at approximately 45 percent of the normal rate.
 









Your GFR Value:













mL/min/1.73 m2








Create an account and track your kidney disease progression
Tracking your GFR levels is easy and free when you join myDaVita.com, the online resource to help you understand and manage all aspects of your kidney care.

Stages of Chronic Kidney Disease











                                            Stage 1 Kidney Disease
                                        

                                            Healthy kidneys or kidney damage with normal or high GFR
                                        

                                            GFR LEVEL: 90 mL/min or more
                                        









Stage 1 CKD is diagnosed when a person has kidney damage and CKD risk factors with normal or high GFR. In Stage 1, there are often few to no symptoms. Management includes a healthy diet, blood pressure regulation and good glucose control in people with diabetes. Early CKD is usually diagnosed when there is:

High blood pressure 
Higher than normal levels of creatinine or urea in the blood 
Blood or protein in the urine 
Evidence of kidney damage in an MRI, CT scan, ultrasound, or contrast X-ray
A family history of  polycystic kidney disease (PKD)

                                            Kidney damage and mild decrease in GFR
                                		

                                            GFR LEVEL: 60 to 89 mL/min
                                        









In Stage 2 CKD, the GFR is mildly decreased between 60-89, indicating the person has kidney damage and mild loss of kidney function. Similar to Stage 1 CKD, following a healthy diet, controlling blood pressure and managing diabetes are key ways to slow the progression of CKD. Early CKD is usually diagnosed when there is:

High blood pressure
Higher than normal levels of creatinine or urea in the blood
Blood or protein in the urine
Evidence of kidney damage in an MRI, CT scan, ultrasound, or contrast X-ray
A family history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD)

                                            Stage 3A & 3B Kidney Disease
                                        

                                            Moderate decrease in GFR
                                        

                                            GFR LEVEL: 30 to 59 mL/min
                                        









Stage 3 CKD, a moderate decrease in kidney function, is divided into 3A (GFR is 45 to 59) and 3B (GFR is 30 to 44). This can occur when someone is in stage 3 of CKD:

Waste products build up in the blood.
Symptoms include fatigue, too much fluid, urination changes, sleep problems and kidney pain.
You can often manage stage 3 by changing to a kidney-friendly diet plan as well as managing high blood pressure and diabetes.
Visit your doctor or nephrologist to help manage kidney disease through kidney-friendly living habits and possibly with prescription medication.

                                            Severe decrease in GFR
                                        

                                            GFR LEVEL: 15 to 29 mL/min
                                        









When CKD has progressed to Stage 4, it's time to begin preparing for dialysis and/or a kidney transplant. If GFR falls below 30, most people need to find a kidney doctor (called a nephrologist) and talk about treatment options.

People may develop complications, such as high blood pressure, anemia, bone disease and cardiovascular diseases.
Symptoms include fatigue, back pain, nausea, taste changes, nerve problems and difficulty sleeping.
Seeing a kidney doctor will help a person manage their disease.
A dietitian is usually referred by a kidney doctor to help a person with kidney disease to learn more about the right kidney diet for them.

Stage 4 of Chronic Kidney Disease













                                            Stage 5 Kidney Disease
                                        

                                            Kidney failure
                                        

                                            GFR LEVEL: Less than 15 mL/min or on dialysis
                                        









A person with Stage 5 CKD has end stage renal disease (ESRD) with a GFR less than 15 ml/min. At this advanced stage of kidney disease, the kidneys have lost nearly all their ability to do their job effectively, and eventually dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed to live.

Symptoms include loss of appetite, nausea, itching, swelling and making little or no urine. 
People with Stage 5 CKD will need to consider a couple of different treatment options, such as dialysis (a treatment that removes wastes and excess fluid from your body) or a kidney transplant.
