Biography
THOMAS SOUTHWORTH was born in 1561.  In 1575, when fourteen years old, he was reported as present at
Roman Catholic mass.  He became a Protestant, and is spoken of as the first Protestant in the family.
While his father was was a prisoner in the Fleet, he was assiduous in looking after his welfare, and
used his influence to have the severity of his imprisonment lessened as much as possible.  There are few
records of THOMAS SOUTHWORTH's life after his father's death.  His estate was heavily encumbered by debts
incurred by Sir JOHN in consequence of the legal costs and fines which he had to pay on account of the
persecution he suffered for his adhesion to the Romanist faith.

THOMAS married ROSAMOND LISTER, daughter of WILLIAM LISTER, of Thornton, in Craven County, York.  He
had a large family, seven sons and four daughters, who were all living in 1595, when their grandfather
made his will.
