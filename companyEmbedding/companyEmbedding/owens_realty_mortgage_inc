The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

WALNUT CREEK, Calif., June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc. (NYSE MKT: ORM) (the "Company") today announced that it has issued a letter in response to Freestone Capital Management's June 1, 2017 open letter to the Company's Chairman and Board of Directors. The full text of the letter follows.

Dear Mr. Furukawa,
On behalf of the Board of Directors of Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc. (the "Company"), I am writing in response to your letter of June 1, 2017.  We value the constructive conversations we have held with you over the years and appreciate your continued feedback, perspective and interest in the Company.  Considering our longstanding history of respectful engagement with you, we were surprised to see your concerns aired in a public letter without first giving us an opportunity to discuss these matters with you privately.  We remain open to continuing an ongoing engagement with you, just like with any of our other stockholders.  However, in light of the numerous misleading and inaccurate statements and statistics in your public letter, we feel compelled to set the record straight.
First and foremost, we remain steadfastly committed to acting in the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders.  As we announced earlier this week, we have authorized a new $10 million stock repurchase plan and have increased our quarterly dividend.  These actions were set in motion and referenced in our public filings and earnings calls long before your June 1 letter. They were also heavily informed by extensive and ongoing stockholder discussions over a period of many months, and in-depth evaluations of the Company's balance sheet and capital needs. They demonstrate our continued commitment to thoughtfully and appropriately deploying capital to deliver immediate value to our stockholders.  The announced repurchase plan on June 13th is the fourth authorized by the Board in as many years, and a clear illustration of the Board's belief in efficiently deploying capital.  Over the past four years the Company has repurchased $12.9 million of its stock and paid out $15.1 million in cash dividends. Going forward, we will continue to opportunistically utilize these tools to close the valuation gap between our share price and book value.
Contrary to your statement that the Company has a "history of trailing market returns", relative to the two indices you selected, we have generated significantly greater returns. During the period from our initial public listing, through April 30, 2017, the Company has generated a total stockholder return of 107.15%, significantly more than the returns generated by the FTSE AREIT Mortgage REIT Index and Russell 2000 Index of 46.90% and 46.01%, respectively. During the period since our public listing on July 1, 2013, we have created net earnings of over $70 million, or approximately $6.73 per share.   As disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have also substantially outperformed the SNL U.S. Finance REIT Index during the period from our initial public listing through the end of 20161:
The underlying cause of this discrepancy between your view and the reality of our financial performance results from your selective inclusion of data over a period that extends back over four years before Owens Realty Mortgage was even a publicly listed company.  The metric you cite, total return to stockholders, includes public stock price appreciation as an input variable, and as this variable would not apply to the Company's pre-public predecessor (thereby artificially depressing the output), your attempted inclusion of pre-public, non-traded limited partnership performance data results in a highly misleading depiction of the value the Company has actually generated for its public stockholders.  
With respect to the Management Agreement, as we announced earlier this week, our Compensation Committee has been engaged in a months-long internal analysis related to our external management structure, including possible amendments to the Company's management agreement that would replace the current management fee payable to the Manager with a management fee based on a stockholders' equity calculation that is similar to industry standards, or an internalization transaction.  In an effort to conduct a thorough review, the Compensation Committee hired a leading independent consultant, FTI Consulting, as an external compensation advisor at the outset of this process. Ultimately, the conclusion the Compensation Committee reaches will be the product of a vigorous and analytical evaluation designed to maximize value for our stockholders.
Although we appreciate your ideas about how to increase stockholder value, we have serious concerns regarding the consequences of liquidation, including adverse economic consequences, negative tax implications, and the potentially significant downward pricing pressure that arises in many liquidations.  The Board has been proactive - and will remain focused – on closing the gap between the Company's stock price and book value.  The Company's stock repurchase program and increased quarterly dividend announced earlier this week are the most recent proofs of this commitment. We also continue to believe the Company's current strategy of disposing real estate assets in a responsible manner and reallocating the balance sheet from primarily real estate to commercial loan investments are the best methods of maximizing net returns and eliminating the valuation gap. 
We would like to reiterate that the Board values and will continue to welcome and take into account the views and opinions of all of our stockholders. Once again, we thank you for your feedback and perspective. 
Regards,
William C. OwensChairman of the Board
1This graph is a comparison of the cumulative total stockholder return on shares of the Company's Common Stock, the Russell 2000 Index, and the SNL U.S. Finance REIT Index, a published industry index, from July 1, 2013 (the day we commenced trading on the NYSE MKT) to December 31, 2016. The graph assumes that $100 was invested on July 1, 2013 in our Common Stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the SNL U.S. Finance REIT and that all dividends were reinvested without the payment of any commissions. There can be no assurance that the performance of the Company's shares will continue in line with the same or similar trends depicted in the graph below. The information included in the graph and table below was obtained from SNL Financial LC, Charlottesville, VA ©2017.

This Stock Has A 2.14% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, and Insiders Have Been Buying
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.
