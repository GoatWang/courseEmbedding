Five American Funds that Beat the First Index Fund’s Lifetime Results 







A look at the first index fund ― the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ― and the five U.S.-focused American Funds available when it launched confirms the following: The idea that you can’t beat the index over long-term periods is a myth. 





























The Potential for Greater Wealth 
As you can see, an investment manager with a proven track record of outpacing the market can produce significantly greater wealth than an index investment.
A comparison of the lifetime results of the first index fund to the results of five American Funds over that same period illustrates our advantage. Those funds are AMCAP Fund, American Mutual Fund, The Growth Fund of America, The Investment Company of America and Washington Mutual Investors Fund. The comparison is especially apt as that index fund was designed to track the S&P 500, which is also the benchmark for the five American Funds which seek to pursue investment objectives such as growth, income or preservation of capital. Watch and see how the American Funds fared since the index fund’s inception — from August 31, 1976, through December 31, 2016:

 The Capital Advantage: A Closer Look 
 


























Figures shown are past results for Class A shares for American Funds (Investor shares for Vanguard 500 Index Fund) and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. Unless otherwise indicated, American Funds returns are shown at maximum offering price (MOP) and reflect deduction of the 5.75% maximum sales charge at the beginning of the period shown. Thus, the net amount invested was $9,425 ($1,885/per fund in the American Funds Blend scenario.). The maximum initial sales charge  was 8.50% prior to July 1, 1988. All distributions were reinvested. The Vanguard fund has no up-front sales charge and is available in another share class with a lower expense ratio. This share class was not available for investment at the inception of the fund. The American Funds are now also available in less expensive share classes that do not feature a sales charge. Current information and month-end results for the Vanguard fund can be found at vanguard.com. For current information and month-end results for the American Funds, visit americanfunds.com.

  Fund Objectives, Investment Strategies and Risks  




















Objective(s)













Investment Strategies













Risks













 American Mutual Fund 









The fund strives for the balanced accomplishment of three objectives: current income, growth of capital and conservation of principal.











The fund seeks to invest primarily in common stocks of companies that are likely to participate in the growth of the American economy and whose dividends appear to be sustainable. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund invests primarily in securities of issuers domiciled in the United States and Canada. The fund may also invest in bonds and other debt securities, including those issued by the U.S. government and by federal agencies and instrumentalities.











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond prices and a bond fund’s share price will generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests.











 AMCAP Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with long-term growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies that have solid long-term growth records and the potential for good future growth. The fund may invest in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States to a limited extent. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMCAP investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Growth Fund of America 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks and seeks to invest in companies that appear to offer superior opportunities for growth of capital. The fund invests primarily in common stocks of large- and mid-capitalization issuers. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, GFA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Investment Company of America 









The fund’s investment objectives are to achieve long-term growth of capital and income. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks, most of which have a history of paying dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, potential for capital appreciation and future dividends are given more weight than current yield. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund may invest up to 15% of its assets, at the time of purchase, in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, ICA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Washington Mutual Investors Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to produce income and to provide an opportunity for growth of principal consistent with sound common stock investing. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of established companies that are listed on, or meet the financial listing requirements of, the New York Stock Exchange and have a strong record of earnings and dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, current and potential yield as well as the potential for long-term capital appreciation are considered. The fund seeks to provide an above-average yield in relation to the S&P 500 Index. The fund strives to maintain a fully invested, diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of high-quality common stocks. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, WMIF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Vanguard 500 Index Fund 









The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large- capitalization stocks. 











The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard & Poor‘s 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index. 











The fund exposes investors to the risks inherent in investing in stocks of companies domiciled in the U.S., including the volatility that comes with its full exposure to the stock market. 

















































*Figures shown are for the period August 31, 1976, the inception date of the first index fund, through March 31, 2017. Standard deviation is a measure of how returns over time have varied from the mean and is one of the most common measures of absolute volatility. A lower number signifies lower volatility.
†The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has no up-front sales charge
Actively managed funds typically have higher turnover than index funds, which may have tax implications. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold within a 12-month period. The lower the percentage, the less buying and selling took place. 
Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus. 











Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at time of publication. When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Please see americanfunds.com for more information. Source for industry average expense ratios is Lipper, based on comparable categories for front-end load funds (except for the Vanguard fund, which is no load, not front-end load), excluding funds of funds, as of each fund’s most recent fiscal year-end available as of March 31, 2017. The Lipper categories for the funds are: AMCAP Fund (Growth); The Growth Fund of America (Large-Cap Growth); The Investment Company of America, Washington Mutual Investors Fund and American Mutual Fund (Growth & Income); and Vanguard 500 Index Fund (S&P 500 Index Objective Funds).

Select Funds Can Reduce Risk
Index funds fall as far as the market they track, but investors don’t have to. Over time they can gain more by losing less.





















  AUGUST 2016





Share




 
 















Gain by Losing Less
There are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market.
Losing less – the so-called low-downside capture approach – holds appeal for investors. Especially considering that 78% of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to 100% of market downturns. 

Downside capture:
A fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness. For example, if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only 96% as far as the market, its downside capture ratio is 96%. If it fell 5% more than the market, its downside capture ratio is 105%. 














  See how American Funds delivered index-beating returns by losing less  







    






                A closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our U.S. stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times.  
              

























Why It Matters
Consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for long-term investors. Funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride, making it easier for those with long-term objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets.




















The Arithmetic of Loss
The ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss. Consider the following:
If a $1,000 investment loses 50%, its value drops to $500. In order for the investment to return to the $1,000 level, that $500 must do more than gain 50% (which would only bring it to $750); it needs to double.
Digging out of a hole is never easy, but the shallower the hole, the shorter the climb.










Better Positioned by Losing Less
The farther an investment falls, the longer the path back to break even. Some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound.








































To Mitigate Risk, Seek Funds That Have Held Up Better During Declines
Looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness.
When we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has, on average, delivered index-beating results.









Finding Funds That Can Mitigate Risk
Within the universe of Large Cap U.S. funds, screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that, on average, outpaced its peers as well as the S&P 500 Index.
Further narrowing the low-downside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further. The chart shown here is based on data for rolling five-year periods for the 20 years ended December 31, 2015.

American Funds Have Two Important Traits 



 
 










When you compare mutual funds, it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers. It’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently. Combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods.1









 Characteristics of Core Funds That Added Value  Two Screens Can Help Sharpen Your Search  





    





Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar® data.1 






















 






Narrowing Your Search


















 
 










The sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming. We examined the large universe of equity funds in Morningstar’s U.S. and foreign large-cap categories over a 20-year period and looked for funds with two traits: those within the lowest 25% of expenses, and those within the highest 25% in manager ownership. We found that the funds with both characteristics (highest manager ownership and lowest expense ratios) meaningfully improved average outcomes for investors.







 Look for Funds That Meet Two Key Criteria  Large-Cap Equity Funds With Low Expense Ratios and High Manager Ownership  











Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.2






















 






Boosting Success Rates





 
 










As shown in the chart below, not all funds are equal. Most, in fact, rarely outpace the index. However, funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers. And funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that. Significantly, the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five- and 10-year periods.
A portfolio of large-cap funds with lower expense ratios and higher manager ownership, on average, outpaced indexes more frequently than other funds. Since large-cap funds account for a big part of most portfolios, those higher success rates can result in substantial gains.

1 Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data. Based on monthly returns from January 1997 to December 2016. U.S. funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. U.S. index is S&P 500. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. International index is MSCI ACWI ex USA. The indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Unless otherwise indicated, all distributions were reinvested. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology. 
2 Data as of December 31, 2016. Domestic funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. Size of quartiles varies because those funds in the Morningstar database that did not include an expense ratio or firm-level investment ownership were excluded from the analysis. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology.

Why It Matters
Choosing an investment manager with a solid track record can make the difference between financial success and shortfall.















Share













Compare Outcomes of Our Investment Management vs. Passive Management
















  
 










The indexing debate isn’t just an academic exercise. You have real goals and financial needs. How can you increase the likelihood of success? Choosing an investment manager that has consistently outpaced the broad market is crucial. The right decision can make a big difference in long-term investment outcomes.
For instance, this chart shows the results of a hypothetical $100,000 investment over 20 years in a blend of relevant indexes compared to equity-focused American Funds. For an investor who contributed $500 a month for 20 years, the American Funds would have provided an ending value $40,043 greater than the index blend. That’s 17% more wealth.









 The Capital Advantage℠ Can Be the Difference Between Success and Shortfall  Equity-Focused American Funds Provided a Significant Advantage for Investors  





    





Data from published sources calculated internally.1






















 






The Capital Advantage













Over the life cycle of an investor, through both the accumulation phase and the retirement income stage, incremental gains can make a big difference. Large-cap equity funds account for the biggest slice of most portfolio allocations, so improving results in that core could have meaningful benefits. Historically, using screens to find those funds with the highest management ownership and lowest cost would have significantly improved outcomes. This chart shows the investment outcomes of a hypothetical investor over a 40-year cycle. American Funds would have outpaced the indexes and our peers. 














Investors Would Have Created More Wealth With a Core of Screened Large-Cap Equity Funds



 
 

















































Data from published sources calculated internally.2







1 The results for the American Funds are Class A shares. The 401(k) hypothetical $500-a-month investment represents a total of $120,000 for the 20-year period ended December 31, 2015. Data from published sources were calculated internally. For the constituents of the American Funds and index blend, as well as additional details about the data, see Methodology.
2 The results for American Funds Core are Class A shares. Hypothetical results assume reinvestment of all dividends. The average annual return and ending investment values for all three investments take into account withdrawals, and portfolios were rebalanced monthly. For the equity core allocation, hypothetical results are based on averages of rolling  5-year periods of monthly returns from January 1996 to December 2015, and portfolios were rebalanced monthly. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods. The index core represents an equally divided allocation between the S&P 500 Index and MSCI ACWI ex USA. The screened equity core comprises actively managed funds in Morningstar’s large-cap categories that fall within both the least expensive net expense ratio and the highest firm-level manager ownership quartiles. The American Funds core represents a 50% allocation to seven equally weighted U.S.-focused American Funds and a 50% allocation to two equally weighted foreign-focused American Funds. The constituents of each allocation can be found on the Methodology page. These sample portfolios exclude fixed income allocations typical of core portfolio holdings. The indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. 
 

















Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns. 
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

Standard & Poor’s® selects the stocks comprising the S&P 500® Index (SPXT) on the basis of market capitalization, financial viability of the company and the public float, liquidity and price of a company’s shares outstanding. The Index is a float-adjusted, market capitalization-weighted index.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

International Index Fund
OverviewPortfolio CharacteristicsPerformancePortfolio Managers
Objective
The Green Century MSCI International Index Fund seeks to achieve long-term total return that matches the performance of an index comprised of the stocks of foreign companies selected based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing in stocks included in the MSCI World ex USA SRI ex Fossil Fuels Index, a custom index calculated by MSCI, Inc. The MSCI World ex USA SRI ex Fossil Fuels Index is comprised of the common stocks of the approximately 239 companies in the MSCI World ex USA SRI Index, minus the stocks of the companies that explore for, process, refine or distribute coal, oil or gas or produce or transmit electricity derived from fossil fuels or transmit natural gas.
Investment Strategy
The Fund seeks to invest in companies that have outstanding ESG ratings and excludes companies whose products or services have negative social or environmental impacts, including fossil fuel companies and factory farms. MSCI is a leading global index provider with which Green Century has partnered for this Fund and the Green Century Equity Fund.
Index stocks are weighted based upon float-adjusted market capitalization. The composition of the Index is reviewed annually and rebalanced quarterly. Companies are evaluated to determine if they have maintained their ESG performance and whether they remain part of the applicable MSCI universe.
Environmental Factors
Green Century provides mutual funds for individuals and institutions who want to invest in a way that reflects their values and concern for their families, the environment and the future. Green Century also believes that investing in an environmentally responsible way is a smart way to invest. For example, companies that minimize their negative environmental impact and follow governance standards may avoid costly lawsuits, regulatory violations and brand damage — and instead could enjoy competitive advantages including cost and liability reductions, profitability enhancements, and access to new and expanding growth markets.
The Fund invests in the stocks of companies selected based on a thorough review of ESG factors and includes those companies believed to have the best overall sustainability records. The Fund does not invest in oil, coal or fracking companies nor does it hold companies with significant involvement in genetically modified organisms (GMOs), military or civilian firearms, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, or nuclear power.
Risk
As with all equity funds, the share price will fluctuate and may fall if the market as a whole declines or the value of the companies in which the Fund invests falls. The value of stocks held in the Fund will fluctuate in response to factors that may affect a single company, industry, market cap, country or region and may perform worse than the market. Foreign securities are subject to additional risks such as currency fluctuations, regional economic and political conditions, differences in accounting methods, and other unique risks compared to investing in securities of U.S. issuers. The Fund’s environmental criteria limit the investments available to the Fund compared to mutual funds that do not use environmental criteria.

	Investment
	Objective




	The
	SPDR S&P International Small Cap ETF (the “Fund”) seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of an index based upon the developed world (ex-US) small cap
	equity markets.







	Fees and
	Expenses of the Fund


	The table below describes
	the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund (“Fund Shares”). This table and the Example below reflect the expenses of the Fund and do not reflect brokerage commissions you may pay on purchases and sales
	of Fund Shares.


	Annual Fund Operating Expenses

	(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment):

	also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

	The Fund pays transaction costs, such as
	commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund Shares are held in a taxable account. These
	costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance.  During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 17% of the average value of its portfolio.


	The Fund's Principal Investment Strategy


	In seeking to track the performance of the S&P
	Developed Ex-U.S. under USD2 Billion Index (the “Index”), the Fund employs a sampling strategy, which means that the Fund is not required to purchase all of the securities represented in the Index. Instead, the Fund may purchase a subset
	of the securities in the Index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and return characteristics of the Index. The quantity of holdings in the Fund will be based on a number of factors, including asset size of
	the Fund. Based on its analysis of these factors, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (“SSGA FM” or the “Adviser”), the investment adviser to the Fund, may invest the Fund's assets in a subset of securities in the Index or may invest
	the Fund's assets in substantially all of the securities represented in the Index in approximately the same proportions as the Index.

	Under normal market
	conditions, the Fund generally invests substantially all, but at least 80%, of its total assets in the securities comprising the Index or in American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) or Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”)
	based on securities comprising the Index. The Fund will provide shareholders with at least 60 days' notice prior to any material change in this 80% investment policy. In addition, the Fund may invest in equity securities that are not included
	in the Index (including common stock, preferred stock, depositary receipts and shares of other investment companies), cash and cash equivalents or money market instruments, such as repurchase agreements and money market funds (including money
	market funds advised by the Adviser).


	The Index is a
	market capitalization weighted index designed to define and measure the investable universe of publicly traded small-cap companies, as defined by the Index, domiciled in developed countries outside the United States. The Index component securities
	are a subset, based on market capitalization and region, of component securities included in the S&P Global BMI (Broad Market Index) (“Global Equity Index”). The Global Equity Index is a comprehensive, float-weighted, rules-based
	benchmark that is readily divisible and customizable. A country will be eligible for inclusion in the Global Equity Index if it is classified as either a developed or emerging market by the S&P Global Equity Index Committee. Country
	classification is reviewed annually and determined based on quantitative criteria and feedback from market participants via a publicly available market consultation. All publicly listed companies with float-adjusted market capitalization of a
	minimum of $100 million and at least $50 million annual trading volume are included for each country. Once included, all current Global Equity Index constituents with float-adjusted market capitalization of a minimum of $75 million and at least $35
	million annual trading volume will remain in the Global Equity Index for each country. All stocks are weighted proportionate to their float-adjusted market capitalization and the Index is rebalanced annually. The Index is
	“float-adjusted”, meaning that only those shares publicly available to investors are included in the Index calculation. To be included in the Index, a publicly listed company must have a total market capitalization between $100 million
	and $2 billion, and be located in a country that meets the BMI Developed World Series criteria. Countries covered in the Index have historically included, among others, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
	Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. As of November 30, 2015, a significant portion of the Index comprised
	companies in the industrial, financial and consumer discretionary sectors, although this may change from time to time.  As of November 30, 2015, a significant portion of the Fund comprised companies located in Japan, although this may change
	from time to time. As of December 31, 2015, the Index comprised 3,903 securities.


	The Index is sponsored by S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the
	“Index Provider”), which is not affiliated with the Fund or the Adviser. The Index Provider determines the composition of the Index, relative weightings of the securities in the Index and publishes information regarding the market value
	of the Index.


	Principal Risks of Investing in the
	Fund


	As with all investments, there are certain risks of
	investing in the Fund. Fund Shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.


	Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk:

	The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of the overall global economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. Success depends heavily on disposable
	household income and consumer spending. Also, companies in the consumer discretionary sector may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their respective profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can
	also affect the demand for, and success of, consumer products and services in the marketplace.



	Currency Risk:

	The value of the
	Fund's assets may be affected favorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates, currency exchange control regulations, and restrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of foreign currencies. Foreign currency exchange rates may have
	significant volatility, and changes in the values of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar may result in substantial declines in the values of the Fund's assets denominated in foreign currencies.



	Depositary Receipts Risk:

	Investments in depositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile than the underlying securities in their primary trading market. If a depositary receipt is denominated in a different currency than its underlying securities, the Fund will be
	subject to the currency risk of both the investment in the depositary receipt and the underlying security. Holders of depositary receipts may have limited or no rights to take action with respect to the underlying securities or to compel the issuer
	of the receipts to take action.



	Equity Investing
	Risk:

	The market prices of equity securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The value of a security may decline for a number of reasons that may directly relate to the
	issuer and also may decline due to general industry or market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company. In addition, equity markets tend to move in cycles, which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended
	periods of time.

	S&P

	International Small Cap ETF




	Financial Sector Risk:

	Financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation which may limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make, the interest rates and fees they can
	charge, the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain. Profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates
	change or due to increased competition. In addition, deterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets, including U.S. and international credit and interbank money markets generally, thereby
	affecting a wide range of financial institutions and markets. Certain events in the financial sector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestic and foreign, and cause certain financial services companies
	to incur large losses. Securities of financial services companies may experience a dramatic decline in value when such companies experience substantial declines in the valuations of their assets, take action to raise capital (such as the issuance of
	debt or equity securities), or cease operations. Credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated with investment activities can negatively impact the sector. Insurance companies may be subject to
	severe price competition. Adverse economic, business or political developments affecting real estate could have a major effect on the value of real estate securities (which include real estate investment trusts (“REITs”)). Declining real
	estate values could adversely affect financial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly connected to the value of real estate.



	Geographic Focus Risk:

	The
	performance of a fund that is less diversified across countries or geographic regions will be closely tied to market, currency, economic, political, environmental, or regulatory conditions and developments in the country or region in which the fund
	invests, and may be more volatile than the performance of a more geographically-diversified fund.



	Japan:

	The
	growth of Japan's economy has historically lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed economies. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist
	measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions of its trading partners. China has become an important trading partner with Japan, yet the countries' political relationship has become strained. Should political tension
	increase, it could adversely affect the economy, especially the export sector, and destabilize the region as a whole. Japan also remains heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a negative impact on the
	economy. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce
	the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons or tsunamis,
	could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy and, in turn, the Fund.



	Index Tracking Risk:

	While the
	Adviser seeks to track the performance of the Index (


	i.e.


	, achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the Fund's return may not match the
	return of the Index. The Fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the Index, and incurs costs in buying and selling securities. In addition, the Fund may not be fully invested at times, generally as a result of cash flows into or
	out of the Fund or reserves of cash held by the Fund to meet redemptions. The Adviser may attempt to replicate the Index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the Index, or in some securities not included in the Index,
	potentially increasing the risk of divergence between the Fund's return and that of the Index.



	Industrial Sector Risk:

	Industrial companies are affected by supply and demand both for their specific product or service and for industrial sector products in general. Government regulation, world events, exchange rates and economic conditions, technological developments
	and liabilities for environmental damage and general civil liabilities will likewise affect the performance of these companies. Aerospace and defense companies, a component of the industrial sector, can be significantly affected by government
	spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on U.S. and foreign government demand for their products and services. Thus, the financial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense
	companies are heavily influenced by governmental defense spending policies which are typically under pressure from efforts to control the U.S. (and other) government budgets. Transportation securities, a component of the industrial sector, are
	cyclical and have occasional sharp price movements which may result from changes in the economy, fuel prices, labor agreements and insurance costs.



	Liquidity Risk:

	Lack of a ready
	market or restrictions on resale may limit the ability of the Fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or price or at all. Illiquid securities may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid investments and may be subject to wide
	fluctuations in market value. Illiquidity of the Fund's holdings may limit the ability of the Fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis. In addition, the Fund, due to limitations on investments in any illiquid securities and/or
	the difficulty in purchasing and selling such investments, may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain market or sector.



	Market Risk:

	The Fund's
	investments are subject to changes in general economic conditions, and general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets. Investment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change substantially due
	to various factors including, but not limited to, economic growth or recession, changes in interest rates, changes in

	the actual or perceived
	creditworthiness of issuers, and general market liquidity. The Fund is subject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and adversely affect global economies and markets.


	Non-Diversification Risk:

	As a
	“non-diversified” fund, the Fund may hold a smaller number of portfolio securities than many other funds. To the extent the Fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers, a decline in the market value of a particular security held
	by the Fund may affect its value more than if it invested in a larger number of issuers. The value of Fund Shares may be more volatile than the values of shares of more diversified funds.



	Non-U.S. Securities Risk:

	Non-U.S. securities (including depositary receipts) are subject to political, regulatory, and economic risks not present in domestic investments. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. entity than about a U.S. entity, and
	many non-U.S. entities are not subject to accounting, auditing, legal and financial report standards comparable to those in the Unites States. Further, such entities and/or their securities may be subject to risks associated with currency controls;
	expropriation; changes in tax policy; greater market volatility; differing securities market structures; higher transaction costs; and various administrative difficulties, such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio transactions or in
	receiving payment of dividends. Securities traded on foreign markets may be less liquid (harder to sell) than securities traded domestically. Foreign governments may impose restrictions on the repatriation of capital to the U.S. In addition, when
	the Fund buys securities denominated in a foreign currency, there are special risks such as changes in currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign government could regulate foreign exchange transactions. In addition, to the extent
	investments are made in a limited number of countries, events in those countries will have a more significant impact on the Fund. Investments in depositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile than the underlying shares in their primary
	trading market.



	Passive Strategy/Index Risk:

	The Fund is managed with a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities, regardless of the current or projected performance of the Index or of the actual
	securities comprising the Index. This differs from an actively-managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Fund's performance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment
	strategy. The structure and composition of the Index will affect the performance, volatility, and risk of the Index and, consequently, the performance, volatility, and risk of the Fund.



	Small-Capitalization Securities Risk:

	The securities of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and may involve more risk than the securities of larger companies. These companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources,
	may lack the competitive strength of larger companies, and may depend on a few key employees. In addition, these companies may have been recently organized and may have little or no track record of success. The securities of smaller companies may
	trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities. Some securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may be restricted as to resale, and their values may have significant volatility. The Fund may be unable to
	liquidate its positions in such securities at any time, or at a favorable price, in order to meet the Fund's obligations. Returns on investments in securities of small-capitalization companies could trail the returns on investments in securities of
	larger companies.



	Unconstrained Sector Risk:

	The Fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets within one or more economic sectors or industries, which may change from time to time. Greater investment focus on one or more sectors or industries increases the
	potential for volatility and the risk that events negatively affecting such sectors or industries could reduce returns, potentially causing the value of the Fund's shares to decrease, perhaps significantly.



	Valuation Risk:

	Some portfolio
	holdings, potentially a large portion of the Fund's investment portfolio, may be valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations. This may occur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced liquidity. There are multiple methods that
	can be used to value a portfolio holding when market quotations are not readily available. The value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been
	priced using market quotations. Portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including “fair valued” securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than
	if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the Fund would incur a loss because a portfolio
	position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by the Fund at that time. Investors who purchase or redeem Fund Shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued investments may receive fewer or more shares or lower or
	higher redemption proceeds than they would have received if the Fund had not fair-valued the holding(s) or had used a different valuation methodology.

	Fund Performance


	The following bar chart and table provide an indication of the
	risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns for certain time periods compare with the average annual returns of the Index. The Fund's past
	performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available by calling 1-866-787-2257 or visiting our website at

	application of foreign tax credits and/or an assumed tax benefit for a shareholder from realizing a capital loss on a sale of Fund Shares.

	John Tucker, CFA, is a Senior Managing Director of
	the Adviser. He joined the Adviser in 1988.


	Karl Schneider, CAIA, is a Vice President of the
	Adviser. He joined the Adviser in 1996.


	Purchase and Sale Information


	The Fund will issue (or redeem) Fund Shares to
	certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of 100,000 Fund Shares known as “Creation Units.” Creation Unit transactions are typically conducted in exchange for the deposit or
	delivery of a designated portfolio of in-kind securities and/or cash constituting a substantial replication, or a representation, of the securities included in the Fund's benchmark Index.


	Individual Fund Shares may only be purchased and
	sold on the NYSE Arca, Inc., other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset
	value (“NAV”), Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).

	Tax Information


	The Fund's distributions are expected to be taxed as ordinary
	income, qualified dividend income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be taxable
	to you.


	Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
	Intermediaries


	If you purchase Fund Shares through a
	broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay the intermediary for certain activities related to the Fund, including educational training programs, conferences, the development of
	technology platforms and reporting systems, or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the
	Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.

Five American Funds that Beat the First Index Fund’s Lifetime Results 







A look at the first index fund ― the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ― and the five U.S.-focused American Funds available when it launched confirms the following: The idea that you can’t beat the index over long-term periods is a myth. 





























The Potential for Greater Wealth 
As you can see, an investment manager with a proven track record of outpacing the market can produce significantly greater wealth than an index investment.
A comparison of the lifetime results of the first index fund to the results of five American Funds over that same period illustrates our advantage. Those funds are AMCAP Fund, American Mutual Fund, The Growth Fund of America, The Investment Company of America and Washington Mutual Investors Fund. The comparison is especially apt as that index fund was designed to track the S&P 500, which is also the benchmark for the five American Funds which seek to pursue investment objectives such as growth, income or preservation of capital. Watch and see how the American Funds fared since the index fund’s inception — from August 31, 1976, through December 31, 2016:

 The Capital Advantage: A Closer Look 
 


























Figures shown are past results for Class A shares for American Funds (Investor shares for Vanguard 500 Index Fund) and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. Unless otherwise indicated, American Funds returns are shown at maximum offering price (MOP) and reflect deduction of the 5.75% maximum sales charge at the beginning of the period shown. Thus, the net amount invested was $9,425 ($1,885/per fund in the American Funds Blend scenario.). The maximum initial sales charge  was 8.50% prior to July 1, 1988. All distributions were reinvested. The Vanguard fund has no up-front sales charge and is available in another share class with a lower expense ratio. This share class was not available for investment at the inception of the fund. The American Funds are now also available in less expensive share classes that do not feature a sales charge. Current information and month-end results for the Vanguard fund can be found at vanguard.com. For current information and month-end results for the American Funds, visit americanfunds.com.

  Fund Objectives, Investment Strategies and Risks  




















Objective(s)













Investment Strategies













Risks













 American Mutual Fund 









The fund strives for the balanced accomplishment of three objectives: current income, growth of capital and conservation of principal.











The fund seeks to invest primarily in common stocks of companies that are likely to participate in the growth of the American economy and whose dividends appear to be sustainable. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund invests primarily in securities of issuers domiciled in the United States and Canada. The fund may also invest in bonds and other debt securities, including those issued by the U.S. government and by federal agencies and instrumentalities.











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond prices and a bond fund’s share price will generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests.











 AMCAP Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with long-term growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies that have solid long-term growth records and the potential for good future growth. The fund may invest in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States to a limited extent. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMCAP investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Growth Fund of America 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks and seeks to invest in companies that appear to offer superior opportunities for growth of capital. The fund invests primarily in common stocks of large- and mid-capitalization issuers. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, GFA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Investment Company of America 









The fund’s investment objectives are to achieve long-term growth of capital and income. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks, most of which have a history of paying dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, potential for capital appreciation and future dividends are given more weight than current yield. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund may invest up to 15% of its assets, at the time of purchase, in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, ICA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Washington Mutual Investors Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to produce income and to provide an opportunity for growth of principal consistent with sound common stock investing. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of established companies that are listed on, or meet the financial listing requirements of, the New York Stock Exchange and have a strong record of earnings and dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, current and potential yield as well as the potential for long-term capital appreciation are considered. The fund seeks to provide an above-average yield in relation to the S&P 500 Index. The fund strives to maintain a fully invested, diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of high-quality common stocks. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, WMIF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Vanguard 500 Index Fund 









The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large- capitalization stocks. 











The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard & Poor‘s 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index. 











The fund exposes investors to the risks inherent in investing in stocks of companies domiciled in the U.S., including the volatility that comes with its full exposure to the stock market. 

















































*Figures shown are for the period August 31, 1976, the inception date of the first index fund, through March 31, 2017. Standard deviation is a measure of how returns over time have varied from the mean and is one of the most common measures of absolute volatility. A lower number signifies lower volatility.
†The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has no up-front sales charge
Actively managed funds typically have higher turnover than index funds, which may have tax implications. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold within a 12-month period. The lower the percentage, the less buying and selling took place. 
Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus. 











Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at time of publication. When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Please see americanfunds.com for more information. Source for industry average expense ratios is Lipper, based on comparable categories for front-end load funds (except for the Vanguard fund, which is no load, not front-end load), excluding funds of funds, as of each fund’s most recent fiscal year-end available as of March 31, 2017. The Lipper categories for the funds are: AMCAP Fund (Growth); The Growth Fund of America (Large-Cap Growth); The Investment Company of America, Washington Mutual Investors Fund and American Mutual Fund (Growth & Income); and Vanguard 500 Index Fund (S&P 500 Index Objective Funds).

American Funds Have Two Important Traits 



 
 










When you compare mutual funds, it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers. It’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently. Combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods.1









 Characteristics of Core Funds That Added Value  Two Screens Can Help Sharpen Your Search  





    





Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar® data.1 






















 






Narrowing Your Search


















 
 










The sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming. We examined the large universe of equity funds in Morningstar’s U.S. and foreign large-cap categories over a 20-year period and looked for funds with two traits: those within the lowest 25% of expenses, and those within the highest 25% in manager ownership. We found that the funds with both characteristics (highest manager ownership and lowest expense ratios) meaningfully improved average outcomes for investors.







 Look for Funds That Meet Two Key Criteria  Large-Cap Equity Funds With Low Expense Ratios and High Manager Ownership  











Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.2






















 






Boosting Success Rates





 
 










As shown in the chart below, not all funds are equal. Most, in fact, rarely outpace the index. However, funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers. And funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that. Significantly, the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five- and 10-year periods.
A portfolio of large-cap funds with lower expense ratios and higher manager ownership, on average, outpaced indexes more frequently than other funds. Since large-cap funds account for a big part of most portfolios, those higher success rates can result in substantial gains. 











 Two Steps Raised the Success Rate  Success Rates in Large-Cap Equities (Net of Fees)  





























Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.1
































1 Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data. Based on monthly returns from January 1997 to December 2016. U.S. funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. U.S. index is S&P 500. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. International index is MSCI ACWI ex USA. The indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Unless otherwise indicated, all distributions were reinvested. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology. 
2 Data as of December 31, 2016. Domestic funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. Size of quartiles varies because those funds in the Morningstar database that did not include an expense ratio or firm-level investment ownership were excluded from the analysis. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology.

Select Funds Can Reduce Risk
Index funds fall as far as the market they track, but investors don’t have to. Over time they can gain more by losing less.





















  AUGUST 2016





Share




 
 















Gain by Losing Less
There are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market.
Losing less – the so-called low-downside capture approach – holds appeal for investors. Especially considering that 78% of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to 100% of market downturns. 

Downside capture:
A fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness. For example, if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only 96% as far as the market, its downside capture ratio is 96%. If it fell 5% more than the market, its downside capture ratio is 105%. 














  See how American Funds delivered index-beating returns by losing less  







    






                A closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our U.S. stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times.  
              

























Why It Matters
Consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for long-term investors. Funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride, making it easier for those with long-term objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets.




















The Arithmetic of Loss
The ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss. Consider the following:
If a $1,000 investment loses 50%, its value drops to $500. In order for the investment to return to the $1,000 level, that $500 must do more than gain 50% (which would only bring it to $750); it needs to double.
Digging out of a hole is never easy, but the shallower the hole, the shorter the climb.










Better Positioned by Losing Less
The farther an investment falls, the longer the path back to break even. Some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound.








































To Mitigate Risk, Seek Funds That Have Held Up Better During Declines
Looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness.
When we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has, on average, delivered index-beating results.









Finding Funds That Can Mitigate Risk
Within the universe of Large Cap U.S. funds, screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that, on average, outpaced its peers as well as the S&P 500 Index.
Further narrowing the low-downside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further. The chart shown here is based on data for rolling five-year periods for the 20 years ended December 31, 2015.




















See methodology.























Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

Standard & Poor’s® selects the stocks comprising the S&P 500® Index (SPXT) on the basis of market capitalization, financial viability of the company and the public float, liquidity and price of a company’s shares outstanding. The Index is a float-adjusted, market capitalization-weighted index.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
