USANA Promotes Three to VP Roles


December 16, 2016
Leave a comment




Three have advanced to vice president roles at USANA Health Sciences Inc., the nutrition company announced Thursday.
The past month has ushered in several leadership changes at USANA, beginning with the appointment of Kevin Guest as sole CEO. Guest formerly shared the role with Co-CEO Dave Wentz, who stepped down at the end of November. The company then named Jim Brown as President, in addition to his role as Chief Operations Officer, and hired on Walter Noot as Chief Information Officer.
Now, three executive directors have been promoted to vice presidents over their respective areas. Ashley Collins will serve as Vice President of Marketing and PR, Amy Haran as Vice President of Communications, and Howard Gurney as Vice President of Product Development Process.
“I have had the pleasure of working with these proven leaders for many years now and know firsthand their dedication and commitment to our employees, stakeholders, distributors and customers,” said Guest. “These talented and ambitious individuals have been essential in hitting key benchmarks within the company and will continue taking us to the next level of excellence.”
Collins, who has led USANA’s public relations and social media efforts, will now oversee the marketing and digital marketing teams as well. In 16 years with the company, she has contributed to major campaigns and helped to develop key relationships with athletes and celebrities, as well as USANA’s sponsorship of The Dr. Oz Show.
Heading up communications, Haran will draw upon 13 years of experience with the company. Her new responsibilities include leading digital communications for USANA’s 1,300 employees and 400,000 distributors, and providing guidance to the customer service, translation and content creation teams.
Gurney formerly served as executive director of quality systems and regulatory affairs, managing the company’s regulatory team. As vice president, he will continue to oversee these areas while orchestrating a wider effort to streamline the product development process.
