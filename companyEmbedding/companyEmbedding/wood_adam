FINISHING
We do not endorse a particular brand or type of finish. We suggest you consult a local hardware or specialty finishing store to determine what finish is best suited to your abilities.
When applying finishes, it is very important to apply the same steps to all sides of your kit expecially the underside of the tops. This helps to stabilize the large wood panels to reduce warping and splitting. It is very important to finish your kit as soon as possible, The large wood panels will warp if left unfinished.

These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection1. Country boy's Firewood - CLOSED238 Smiley York RdDemorest, GA 30535(706) 768-8392FirewoodWood ProductsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection2. Mountain Wood Products Inc5138 Highway 254Cleveland, GA 30528(706) 348-1470Wood ProductsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection3. G-M Wood Products1159 Meadowbrook DrEastanollee, GA 30538(706) 779-0312Wood ProductsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection4. Osborne Wood Products Inc4618 Highway 123Toccoa, GA 30577(706) 886-1065Wood ProductsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection5. Osborne Wood Products Inc8116 Highway 123 NToccoa, GA 30577(706) 886-1065LumberWood ProductsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection6. Scott Wood Products1585 Yorkhouse RdRabun Gap, GA 30568(706) 746-2576LumberWood ProductsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection7. Country Wood Works190 Builders PkwyCornelia, GA 30531(706) 778-9663Wood ProductsCarpentersWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection8. Mwl4052 Highway 184 NToccoa, GA 30577(706) 886-5813Wood ProductsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection9. Precision Woodcrafting77 Rumsey AveToccoa, GA 30577(706) 886-0105Wood ProductsCabinet MakersAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection10. Mathena's Wood Crafts21 River StHelen, GA 30545(706) 878-3305Wood ProductsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection11. Heritage Wood Craft586 Staton RdCleveland, GA 30528(706) 219-4043Wood ProductsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your home collection!Error when adding to home collectionThis business was removed from the home collection12. American Woodmark Corp398 Woodmark DrEastanollee, GA 30538(706) 779-3304Wood ProductsWebsiteFrom Business: American Woodmark Corporation, also known as AWC, is a publicly traded company that manufactures and distributes kitchen and bath cabinets.
