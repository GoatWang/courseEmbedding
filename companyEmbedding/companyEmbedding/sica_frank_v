Frank V Sica
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Pennsylvania:













Does Frank V Sica carry a valid contracting license?



Pennsylvania does not have any licensure or certification requirements for most construction contractors. However, on July 1, 2009, the Home Improvement Consumer Protection Act (Senate Bill 100) took effect. This law requires most home improvement contractors to register with the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office. 
Frank V Sica currently holds license RA402360 (Architects, Registered Architect), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Pennsylvania?



Contractors in Pennsylvania do not have to take an exam prior to registering as home improvement contractors. 











Your liability risk when hiring Frank V Sica



Registered home improvement contractors in Pennsylvania must show proof of general liability insurance, workers' compensation insurance is not required. It is a good idea to only hire contractors with current general liability and workers' compensation policies. Be sure to request copies of insurance certificates for each before any work begins. 











What else should I know before hiring Frank V Sica



Pennsylvania has some of the lightest regulations on home improvement contractors in the US and there is no financial or criminal background check performed on contractors by the State. The Pennsylvania State Police maintain a publicly accessible database so consumers can run their own background check before making a hire if they are so inclined. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Pennsylvania, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
