Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2015 Tesoro Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Towanda, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the call over to Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Sreeram Ramraj - Vice President-Investor Relations
Good morning, and welcome to today's conference call to discuss third quarter 2015 earnings. Joining me are Greg Goff, Chairman and CEO, and Steven Sterin, Executive Vice President and CFO.
The earnings release, which includes financial disclosure and reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures, should help you in analyzing our results and can be found on our website at tsocorp.com.
Please refer to the forward-looking statements in the earnings release, which says, statements made during this call that refer to management's expectations and our future predictions, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Act as there are many factors which could cause results to differ from our expectations.
Now, I will turn the call over to Steven.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Sam. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our third quarter financial performance and then turn the call over to Greg.
Yesterday, we reported record quarterly results. We believe this performance demonstrates our continued focus on executing our business improvement plans, running our refineries efficiently and at high rates, and creating shareholder value by productively allocating cash.
Third quarter net earnings from continuing operations were $759 million or $6.13 per diluted share compared to $397 million or $3.06 per diluted share last year. Reported results in the third quarter include an inventory charge due to a lower cost or market valuation adjustment of $83 million or $0.41 per diluted share.
This is a result of the decline in crude oil and product prices relative to our LIFO carrying value. Excluding this impact and the exclusion of a gain related to an insurance settlement of $0.06 per share, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $802 million or $6.48 a share.
We delivered record adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of approximately $1.6 billion. This represents an increase of 84% from $858 million last year. This was primarily due to successful execution of our business improvement plans, strong marketing sales, and high utilization at our refineries.
Refining segment's adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter 2015 was approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 70% from $657 million a year ago. Our total refinery throughput for the quarter was 861,000 barrels a day or 101% utilization.

During the quarter, we successfully completed a turnaround at our Los Angeles refinery. Our ongoing business improvement efforts at this refinery allowed us to utilize new pipeline connections and we're able to share intermediate feedstock between different portions of the refinery and run at higher utilization.
The Tesoro Index was $23.09 per barrel in the third quarter, with the realized gross refining margin of $20.49 per barrel or 89% of the Tesoro Index. This compares to a realized gross refining margin of $14.92 a barrel or 121% of the Tesoro Index from last year.
This quarter's capture rate was impacted by the combination of weaker crude oil differentials and maintenance activity at our Los Angeles refinery. Manufacturing costs in the third quarter decreased $0.58 per barrel over the same period last year to $4.84 per barrel. This decrease was primarily due to continued lower energy prices and high refinery utilization.
The logistics segment's adjusted EBITDA was $158 million in the third quarter compared to $80 million a year ago. The substantial year-over-year increase was driven by contribution from the Rockies Natural Gas Business, which delivered $213 million of EBITDA year-to-date, and increased volumes in our crude oil gathering business.
The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were $38 million during the third quarter and $106 million year-to-date. This is an increase of $51 million or 93% versus last year, further highlighting the substantial value creation for Tesoro shareholders as a result of our execution of the logistics growth plan.
The marketing segment's EBITDA was a record $390 million, more than double the $190 million seen in the third quarter of last year. This is primarily due to higher fuel volumes, reflecting strong growth in consumer demand. Same-store fuel sales during the quarter were up 2.1% relative to last year.
As a result of driving strong operating performance through our business improvement plan and the favorable market impacts seen this year, Tesoro generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of this year, after payment of $169 million of dividends on Tesoro shares and $135 million on TLLP public distributions.
Year-to-date, we've deployed this capital as follows. We invested $440 million in high return capital projects in Tesoro and TLLP. We repurchased approximately 5.5 million shares for $494 million at an average price of about $90 a share, and we repaid $398 million of secured debt.
We remain committed to continuing to allocate capital to create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. We do this by focusing first on investing in our business improvements and high return capital projects.
We also want to continue to grow our dividend and remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In addition, we're continuing our efforts to drive Tesoro and TLLP towards investment-grade credit ratings.
We paid down $398 million of secured debt at Tesoro and currently have no outstanding secured borrowings. On September 30t, S&P reaffirmed the credit ratings on both Tesoro and Tesoro Logistics while placing both entities on a positive outlook.
Given the transformative substantial improvements we have made in our base business, coupled with portfolio enhancements, we believe that we're well-positioned to achieve our long-term goal in investment-grade credit rating. This is important to both companies as it lowers the cost of borrowings, allows for longer term borrowings and creates greater financial flexibility.
Looking ahead, you can find details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel, and other elements related to our fourth quarter outlook in our earnings release issued yesterday.

We are confident in our ability to drive earnings growth for 2015 and beyond, as we focus on capturing value across our integrated business model, and executing on our business improvement programs, which we believe will create substantial shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. We had a record quarter of EBITDA and earnings per share. We attribute this to three things. One, strong operational execution. We achieved 101% refinery utilization rate. Two, record marketing volume supported by higher consumer demand. And three, capturing value through our business improvement programs.
Also, we returned $287 million to shareholders and paid down $399 million of debt as Steven just stated. Year-to-date, we returned a total of $663 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.
Now, turning to our operations. Our refining business delivered record results driven by high reliability, high utilization and lower operating costs. The Tesoro Index in the third quarter averaged over $23 per barrel, which is one of the highest levels we have seen for a quarter.
The summer peak driving season led to an increase in U.S. gasoline demand. In fact, U.S. vehicle miles traveled in July increased 4.2% year-over-year to $284 billion, which is a record. In California, the economy remains strong and continues to improve. Year-to-date, vehicle miles traveled grew 2.9% over last year. This was aided by an expanding employment.
In the West Coast, we maintained a competitive position by optimize our operations to maximize gasoline production and running full crude rates at our Los Angeles refinery, despite a planned turnaround.
Utilization in our California region was in excess of 100%. In the Pacific Northwest, we optimized our crude slate to run higher levels of advantaged crude oil and substituted Canadian crude oil for waterborne feedstocks. In the Mid-Continent, crack spreads remained strong.
Our Salt Lake City refinery had a record throughput in the quarter. We ran 64,000 barrels per day of crude oil, including 20,000 barrels of waxy crude oil following the successful completion of the expansion project in the second quarter.
Moving to our logistics segment. TLLP announced another strong quarter of growing volume across the business. Both our crude oil and natural gas gathering businesses continued to grow volumes in the face of a challenging commodity price environment. Our crude oil gathering volumes in the quarter were up 47% year-over-year. Natural gas gathering volumes increased approximately 10% during the first nine months of the year.
For the first nine months of 2015, the Rockies Natural Gas Business contributed $213 million of adjusted EBITDA, and is on track to contribute approximately $275 million of EBITDA for the full year.
We are in the final stages of offering Tesoro Logistics the opportunity to acquire crude oil and refined product storage and pipeline assets in Los Angeles. We expect these assets to deliver annual EBITDA to TLLP in the range of $50 million to $75 million. TLLP expects to fund this transaction through an equal combination of debt and issuing units to Tesoro. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter. TLLP expects to deliver $650 million to $670 million of EBITDA for full year 2015 and remains fully committed to the $1 billion EBITDA target established for 2017.
We are committed to growing a full-service logistics business for our focus on growing and optimizing our stable fee-based business, expanding our backlog of high return organic growth projects, and pursuing third-party transactions, and providing future dropdown opportunities.

Shifting to our marketing segment. EBITDA for the quarter was a record $390 million. This was the result of volume growth, supported by strong consumer demand and our marketing integration, which was 94% by the end of the quarter.
We are successfully executing our business improvement plans with strong contributions from our value chain optimization strategy. This translates into increased and sustainable EBITDA growth, which is in excess of market gains. Year-to-date, our business improvements are $505 million. We delivered approximately $130 million in West Coast improvements, exceeding our goal of $95 million to $125 million for the full year.
For example, we improved pipeline connections between the Los Angeles refinery sites; crude oil optimization from the integration of the Los Angeles refinery sites, and new cargo sharing between our California refineries.
We captured margin improvements of approximately $120 million compared to our full year goal of $130 million to $170 million with contributions from the completion of the second phase expansion of the waxy crude oil project at our Salt Lake City refinery, improved crude blending processes at our Mandan refinery and operating expense reductions.
We also delivered $255 million of logistics growth year-to-date against our target of $325 million to $375 million of logistics improvements for the full year. We are on track to achieving our business improvement commitment of $670 million for this year.
To give you an update on our Vancouver Energy project, we expect the Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, or EFSEC, to release the Draft Environmental Impact Statement at the end of November. We are committed to the proposed 360,000 barrel per day crude oil rail-to-marine terminal, and remain very confident that a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct and operate a safe environmentally responsible facility that offers benefits to the state of Washington and the West Coast.
As we look forward, we remain positive on our outlook. The fourth quarter is typically a seasonally weaker demand period. However, crack spreads quarter-to-date have been higher than 2014, with PADD 5 gasoline demand up about 3% year-over-year, benefiting from increase in vehicle miles traveled.
While the current pace of high demand growth for Clean Products would be hard to maintain, we believe demand growth will be between 0.5% to 1% in 2016, which is still healthy and positive for our business. We expect utilization in the fourth quarter to be between 92% and 97%. This guidance includes planned maintenance in our California region.
We look forward to discussing our performance in 2015 and outlining our plans for 2016 at our Analyst and Investor Day event on December 9 in New York City. For additional details on this event, please follow up with our Investor Relations team.
So let me conclude by saying that we have built a strong integrated refining, logistics and marketing business and have a very competitive position on the West Coast. Independent of the favorable market conditions, we continue to efficiently optimize our assets across the value chain, deliver on our commitments, and create shareholder value.
Now, we'll take your questions. Operator?

Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hey. Good morning, Greg.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Neil.
Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.
So it was an outstanding quarter here at the retail segment. Just wanted to dive deeper there. Is the strength in the quarter really a function of the demand you're seeing in California? And I know we'll get a little bit more clarity on this on December 9, but how are you thinking about different strategies to create incremental value out of your retail/wholesale business?

Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We'd continue to improve our marketing operations over time and are realizing the benefits in addition to a very favorable market environment that you just stated. And our primary focus is to: one, to continue to grow our marketing business and deliver higher integration than we've had in the past.
Two, we want to strengthen our portfolio of marketing assets that we believe we can create better value with. And then third, we're going to strengthen our offering that we offer to customers and believe they will be able to deliver substantial value from that. And as you said, we will share our plans at the meeting we have in December.
Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks, Greg. And the second question, I recognize there are sensitivities around this. But you publicly expressed an interest in becoming larger in the Mid-Continent as you think about diversifying the portfolio. In a scenario where U.S. production is lower, especially in the Mid-Continent, do you think these differentials will be sustainably tighter? And does that change the way you think about the potential value creation from getting larger in the Mid-Continent?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. We continue to evaluate all the opportunities for the company. As you would expect, we look at all the drivers of how we create value, and the market is one of those things that we take into consideration. We don't see a material change that would alter our view on our desire to continue to grow the company in all aspects, refining, marketing and logistics, and moving more east from our strong position on the West Coast.
Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks, Greg. Congrats on the quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Dietert with Simmons. Please proceed.
Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International
Good morning.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Jeff.
Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International
Congratulations on the progress on moving towards investment grade. I know you're not there yet, but it's obviously that you are making good progress. I was hoping to ask about the business improvements, especially on the logistics operation. I think that was a big increase, the $255 million relative to second quarter I believe was 155 million. Could you talk about the progress during the quarter and the outlook for hitting the target?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Jeff. So, our logistics, as you're aware, is really comprised of two things. One is the growth as a result of the Natural Gas Business acquisition, so the cumulative impact of continuing to deliver on the business in the Rockies primarily is, like I said, in my comments on target and will be on the high range of our expectations, even in a pretty challenging commodity environment.
And then secondly, continued growth really across the system through our efforts to better optimize the assets, as well as organic growth projects coming on. One of the key drivers for us is the ability to go out and identify good opportunities in the marketplace, whether they be in the crude oil, refined products or Natural Gas Business and organically grow that business. So it's just a continuation of that.
Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International
Understand. Secondly if I could, the market conditions in California have been favorable this year. But if you could talk a little bit about what you think normalized margins might look like, given the changing economic and demand environment for West Coast margins or California refining margins.

Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. As we look at the West Coast and we just look at the overall market fundamentals, supply, demand, utilization rates in the refineries across the system, and over time, maybe a slow start going back a number of years after the financial crisis, but over time, that has just continued to improve as primarily the California economy has gotten a lot stronger. So the fundamental drivers of the business, specifically in California, but the West Coast in general, as the way we look at it, has continued to just be favorable to what drives our business.
And so our outlook over time is, we will look at about a $1 to $2 improvement in our Index next year, which is primarily driven by just the stronger fundamental analysis of the market. And that's not versus 2015. Jeff, that's averages like a base of of 2014 for our Index, and then we look at that off of 2014 because of the unusual circumstances in 2015.
Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International
Sure. Thanks for your comments.

Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC. Please proceed.
Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess...
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Brad.
Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC
...following on, on the previous question, given the sort of apparent tightness in California gasoline, regardless of whether Torrance comes back online in the near future or not, has it given you any second thoughts about the potential FCC decommissioning in LA and/or the mixed xylenes project and whether you actually want to be subtracting incremental gasoline volumes out of the California market?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
First, let me just clarify on the work we're doing in Los Angeles which we referred to as the integration and compliance project. The purpose of the work there is, one, to integrate the two facilities as a result of physically connecting the two refineries. We're able to create more flexibility in the yield structure of the refinery. So we can actually make the same amount of gasoline, but we have more flexibility to supply the market with either diesel fuel or jet fuel, if that's what the demand in the market is. So that we have considerable flexibility there and that's what that project is driven by.
The work on our mixed xylenes project, which is progressing extremely well, basically allows us to produce a higher value product. So what we are doing is making a higher value product relative to gasoline blending components and then selling that into a market that's very, very attractive. So long answer to your question, but the answer is no, we are still very committed to both of those projects because of what they deliver to the market and for the company.
Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then...
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC
...thinking about Tesoro being one of the larger runners of Bakken, how do you think about Bakken volumes potentially declining? The impact on the system, whether it still makes sense to be running Bakken and Anacortes given spread so tight with Brent, how do you see that affecting the system going forward?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think in the short-term, there have been factors that have caused the differentials to tighten up with some of the things going on in Canada, which has definitely put pressure on the differentials versus how they have been historically. However, as we look out over time, even in a lower price environment, we still see economic value to be able to move Bakken to the West Coast and achieve the benefits that we have always stated which primarily are driven by the yield improvements in the refineries, as long as you can competitively price the crude in there. And as we've seen how that's traded, and there is a lot of pressure on prices or cost to move the crude to the West Coast, which will allow to maintain its competitiveness in our view.

Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Greg.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Doug
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Greg, clearly extraordinary cash flows in this environment. Just wondering what your latest thoughts are in terms of use of I think what you've described to me before as a tremendous windfall. I'm thinking about pension, we don't see you talk too much about that. And perhaps not to put you in the spot, but perhaps even some more innovative issues such as upstream integration. And I've got a follow-up, please.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. First, let me – I'm going to ask Steven to comment to you on how we use our free cash flow.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Good morning, Doug. So at a high level first, our commitment to creating value through cash deployment hasn't changed. We really start first by making sure that we've got funding for our business improvement, our high return capital projects. As we move beyond that, we want to continue over time to grow the dividend, and we want to be able to continue to return cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases as well.
When we look at the balance sheet, really to your question about paying down debt or pension, we like to have a approach to managing both. In fact, our pension plan, we have been funding about $60 million a year every year above what's required to over time take that liability down and really kind of dollar cost average into it. We find that to be a very effective approach, so we'll continue to do that and continue to evaluate that.
And in terms of debt, as we said in our remarks, eliminating secured debt from the portfolio, not only helps us with investment grade, but having the leverage levels we do now, we've got much more flexibility as we go forward to continue to invest in growth of the company, whether that be kind of the business improvements we talk about, or potential bolt-on acquisitions and those types of things.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
So I would just add to Steven's comments, Doug, just to maybe elaborate on other things. It's interesting in the environment that we find ourselves in now with. From a price standpoint for crude oil and natural gas, we are seeing lots of interesting opportunities across the whole value chain. And we are actively looking at a number of things. I would probably say that the ideas and the opportunities today are probably greater for us than they were – than when the prices were higher. So it runs the whole gamut of all different possibilities and we're very actively looking at a number of things.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. I appreciate the answers. I guess, the follow-ups, and it's probably something as – maybe it's a December issue, but your latest given the strength of retail this quarter, Greg that, what are your latest thoughts in terms of whether you are getting recognition for the value of those assets, and what you might do to get greater recognition, let's say? And I will leave it there. Thank you.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Our marketing business, as I kind of stated a little bit earlier about kind of what we're looking out there, we're very confident that we can continue to grow the contributions of marketing to our reintegrated value chain. It's an integral part of that business, and we really want to strengthen the portfolio of different types of outlets that we have through our customers. And so we'll talk more fully about our plans and our ideas going forward, because we see very significant potential there to grow that business. Thanks, Doug.

Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. First question just on the operating expense reduction progress that you talked about. You've saved a lot year-over-year on a dollar basis and a per barrel as well. When you look ahead at the operating expense reduction potential, is it more just to offset ongoing inflation or do you think that there is an ability to continue to cut? Obviously there has been some natural gas help this year as well.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we refer to it as improve rather than cut. But we would say that we always target to offset the inflationary cost of doing business. And our view is that in total, the inflation in our business averages between 3% to 4% per year. So, we always try to offset that by creative ways to lower and improve our cost structure.
We also, based upon benchmarking that, believe that there are opportunities to drive other improvements in the business, above and beyond the, just the offsetting the inflationary costs and we are very focused on doing that. And that will come over time over the next couple of years in that. But we have made significant progress and having a very competitive cost position. But there are additional opportunities.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. On the West Coast improvements being above the high end of the range for the year two quarters or three quarters, would you call that a timing function, or are there more opportunities that you see there to continue to drive improvement?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, continued delivery of our fundamental approach to drive improvements in the business there and we see additional opportunities which we will talk about in about 45 days or whenever it is in New York. So, it's actually quite encouraging, our ability to go in and deliver those improvements and keep delivering more of those.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And if I can just sneak one last one on the capture rates. They are pretty flattish sequentially 3Q versus 2Q, you provided some helpful commentary last quarter. Just curious if you have anything you would offer up about how to think about capture rates this quarter, any moving pieces that you think would matter to us.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. As we look at the fourth quarter, based on the production plans we laid out and the costs in the current market environment, we expect capture rates to be at or slightly above what we saw in the third quarter.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Your next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin with Cowen & Co. Please proceed.
Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC
Good morning, everybody. How are you?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Great, Sam.
Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC
So there is a few dropdowns in the hopper, it seems like. And this next tranche of TLLP transfers seems like it's going to be a little more sponsor funded than they have in the past. Can you talk about the thought process there? And specifically sort of what I'm getting at is, is that evaluated as a use of capital for Tesoro, or is that more of a response to market conditions?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll let Steven comment on that.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. It's actually a combination of both. I think on the one hand, as you see, the equity markets for the units in the MLP space, it's a very, very volatile market right now. And so it's not a very attractive place right now to raise capital. All that being said, as Tesoro, we believe it's a good investment for Tesoro shareholders to own and continue to own shares and maybe even increase ownership in TLLP over time. But to balance that with, as we drop these assets down, generating cash for us to be able to bring back to Tesoro and deploy for high value.

And so our approach as Greg said in his prepared remarks of this being about 50%-50% new debt, and 50% Tesoro taking equity, we think accomplishes those objectives. And then also, we really want to see TLLP move to investment grade. It's very important given how much growth there is there and how much you touch the debt markets to have the ability to take long duration borrowings to fund that growth. And so by going 50%-50%, or in that range, plus or minus around there, allows us to naturally delever TLLP as well.
Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks so much. And secondly, on M&A, just to pick your brain a little bit, location is a huge part of evaluating potential candidates for acquisition, obviously. Where would – not just location in terms of crude access, but also maybe in terms of market access, where does kind of direct marketing capabilities or the opportunity for retail integration or already existing retail integration kind of rank on your evaluation process of looking at assets to potentially bring into the fold?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean fundamentally, our business model is to be a highly integrated across the value chain. We've been creating that. We have more work to do, and we will deliver higher levels of integration. So whether it be refining, marketing or logistics, the opportunities that we look at and how we strategically think about how can we create value across that value chain, would include all segments of the business and particularly driven by the complementary impact that they have on each other.
Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC
All right. Thank you so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Please proceed.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, guys. Good morning
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Paul.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
A number of hopefully quick questions. Steven, let's assume you have achieved on your investment grade, any rough estimate, how much is the interest saving or that crude purchase saving that you may be able to achieve because I presume that you no longer need to post the net (34:19) so any rough estimate on what is the benefit?
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. Good morning. I think the most substantial benefit will be on the cost of debt within TLLP. And if you look at the current debt levels there, roughly $3 billion and that will continue to grow as we grow the business. And just based upon what we have looked at historically on an average basis of spreads, that could be 150 basis points or 250 basis points. So, call it $60 million or $80 million a year and probably growing. So that's a direct savings. But probably equally important is the ability to have longer duration debt, and have more stable access to the markets.
Tesoro obviously carries some debt as well, so I think about that 150 basis point number makes sense at the Tesoro level. And then you're right, there will be commercial and operational savings, although given how strong our financial performance is we've been working on that already. So even absent investment-grade, we've been driving down LC costs and borrowing costs with suppliers. There will be some there, but it will be smaller than the interest savings.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
I see. And Steven or Greg, do you guys have a cash return PL target?
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I think we do think about all of those collectively. We think about driving total shareholder return. And when you look at the levers to do that, we think the biggest lever we can pull to create the best shareholder return is our business improvement, organic growth programs, really across the portfolio followed by smart and thoughtful acquisitions that bolt into that, that either accelerate those growths or add to it.

And then in terms of the dividend, we want to grow the dividend over time as the company grows. And then when you have excess cash beyond those things, buyback shares – and you have seen what we have done with buybacks and we would like to be able to continue to do all of those. And so the key is to make sure that even in a market – neutral environment, which we plan to that we can generate operational cash from the business to fund all of that and still naturally delever and yet have a stronger balance sheet as we do it.
Those are the variables we think about, Paul. So over time, you look at the last five years, the growth in just the value of the shares has substantially returned more relative value. If you look at the three impacts of dividend, share purchase and the stock, we hope to keep driving all three of those collectively to be top in the industry.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Greg, the fourth quarter turnaround you said primarily accrued unit or it is conversion units in California for you guys?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. The fourth quarter turnaround is actually coming to completion here and it is primarily accrued unit.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And Steven do you have an estimate, what might have been the opportunity cost loss from the trend downturn in the third quarter?
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
We actually came in about where we expected to. So when we kind of set out our throughput rates – and actually, they were actually down a little bit early compared – we don't quantify our LTO, per se. But when we give you our guidance and our outlook, we kind of take all of that into account. And on the utilization side, we actually came in a little bit favorable to what we thought going into the third quarter.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
A final question. Greg, I think last time I asked and you said that in order for you to keep the schedule to be on track for the LA integration project and the mixed xylene, you need to get the permit by probably the first half of next year. Any change in view that whether you still believe that you are progressing and that should be able to achieve, or that you think we may see some delay?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
You're exactly right, Paul, in our critical path on both the Los Angeles project and the mixed xylene project, the isomerization project and Vancouver Energy permitting is in the critical path of every one of those projects. And we are actively working every one of those permitting processes. But I will tell you, it's very difficult. Permitting is incredibly challenging in that, but right now, everything that we see, we stay on our plan. But it's not easy. It's very difficult.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And just want to – I have a final point, I want to say thank you that consolidating your presentation into your press release on the guidance saved us some headache because it's too many presentation and perhaps we need doing the earning season, so really helpful. Thank you.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Paul. Take care.

Your next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hi there. I'm going to start with sort of a philosophical question. Your business mix, you've got free cash flow from your mature refining assets you've been operating well and that's created a strong sponsorship for the midstream growth, and the retail. Obviously, the cash flows for refining, right now, they're good. In other times, they're not so good. So there is sort of a through cycle free cash flow which creates the strength for you to be aggressive in the midstream.

As you think about bolt-on acquisitions, how do you think about that balance evolving? Are you worried that you'll end up with too much sort of logistics growth assets that need external funding and not enough cash flow in the refining coal? Just some thoughts around that general balance.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, the logistics assets are pretty much self-funding, Ed. So they're not tied. If you look, they're almost completely standalone with the exception of when Tesoro takes back equity. So from a logistics standpoint, we're very confident we can continue to grow that business by our capability to both fund through debt, equity, both public and Tesoro-backed equity there and that model will continue to sustain itself.
The other part from the cash flow generated from refining, as Steven has said a couple of time today that one is, we are very focused on investing in driving high reliability in our assets through our asset integrity programs and making very, very good progress from that standpoint. And that requires a certain amount of cash flow, which isn't part of free cash flow but it's important to recognize that that is a use of cash that we generated from refining operations.
But we believe with the improvements that we've driven in the refining business and the way that we operate the model that even in an environment that were to maybe not be as attractive as we've seen over the last few years, we'll still have cash flow that will allow us to do the things that we need to do with the company. And then a question is how we grow our marketing business. We want to be able to grow our marketing business, and that requires some cash also do that. And we'll talk more about that at our Analyst Meeting.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
And then you mentioned bolt-on acquisitions. I mean presumably those are all – are they midstream retail or do they include refining as well?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
When we talk about bolt-on acquisitions, those are primarily in the marketing and logistics space. They're not – a bolt-on acquisition wouldn't be a acquisition of say a refinery. We would consider that a little bit different.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
And then California you said you're going to raise your outlook for next year, but I mean eventually efficiency gains are going to kick in to that market and that may impact margins longer term. Is this a signal of sort of a sustainable increase in margins, or would just sort of for the next few years?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think on the West Coast as we look at the drivers, our view is that they are fundamental – the margin environment on the West Coast is fundamentally supported by the supply/demand, the economic environment on the West Coast and that we see that kind of being able to sustain itself like that. So we see that is a sustainable improvement in the environment.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
So sort of five-year timeframe.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Out in time. I don't know, three years, five years, 10 years. The threat is not only in California, but everywhere else is what happens to gasoline demand over time and then how are the reactions to gasoline demand if it declines over time. Our view is it will slightly decline, going out over a longer timeframe like you said, but not significantly.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Helpful and clear. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Good morning, guys.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Faisel.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Is it possible for you to breakdown sort of the profitability from retail and marketing? I mean it looks like this is sort of the strongest unit margin we've seen since you recast the numbers.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
So just trying to figure out sort of how this breaks down.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I mean you're exactly right. I mean, per unit profitability is extremely strong. But I'm not sure if I understand what you mean break it down. It's strong ...
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Well, I guess there's the – sorry, there is this retail component and then there is the marketing component and the retail fuel margin and then there's the wholesale of marketing margin, which I think is – they can move in different directions.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
No. We just talk about it as our overall aggregate refining margin and not the details. I mean I think the point to make is that the aggregate margin from our marketing business was stronger than it has been.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Do those two businesses sort of move together in tandem, or can they sometimes move in opposite directions?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I mean, they're driven by competitive market factors, so they can move different way depending on what's going on in the marketplace.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Understood. And then in terms of – you guys talked about you paid down roughly $400 million in debt. Is there a target of how much more you'd like to pay down from here on out or are we sort of at the level you would like?
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I think in terms of the leverage levels, we're even beyond what's required for investment-grade at Tesoro. The key here around this was to pay down secured debt, and that's really what we wanted to accomplish by paying down the term loan. But we're well below what's required from a leverage perspective at Tesoro. So we've got the flexibility on the balance sheet now to execute the strategy and achieve investment-grade.
At TLLP, in fact, debt levels on an absolute basis will increase to support the growth, and so the key with TLLP is to continue to move closer and closer to that $1 billion of EBITDA to have that kind of standalone size that warrants investment-grade rating. And so that's how I would think about it from a macro perspective.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Got it. And as we think about sort of the movement of crude by rail to the West Coast for you guys, there was some commentary in the public domain about some of the Canadian rail companies reducing their rates in order to bring more business back on their rail systems. I just want to understand I mean, is there any sort of benefit that that could accrue to you in terms of potentially lower costs? Are those negotiations that you've had or are going to have?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think Faisel, the answer to your question is that the competitive pressure being put on the distribution system, not only in rail rates, but loading rates, unloading rates, railcar rates, and we've been saying for some time, we felt like that would manifest into lower total cost to move crude in, and you're right, the Canadians have publicly stated their effort to maintain to become even more competitive and we believe that that will happen here also.

We see it in pockets already, and it will continue to drive a more competitive cost of supply to get the crude oil to the markets that we're very confident will happen and believe that's one of the key drivers why Vancouver Energy will be very attractive.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering. Please proceed.
Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. Steven, I was wondering if you could provide any color on 2015 CapEx. Looks like it moved up a little bit, with a fairly large increase for TSO, but then a drop for TLLP. Any further color there?
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. So first on the Tesoro side, as we moved through the year, we identified really two areas where we saw opportunity to make additional investment. About a third of that has to do with us driving some substantial improvements in our systems and our back office processes to make us – as we've grown the company, to make us even more efficient in the back office, but it particularly gives us ability to be more scalable as we grow the company with our administrative and back office processes.
The other two-thirds are high return, high payback projects that we've identified in refining as we've gone through the year that we really wanted to get on and execute because they're very attractive capital projects. So that's the increase in Tesoro. The decrease in TLLP really is more of a timing issue than anything. We have seen a couple of our projects move, and we expect to execute a strong capital program in 2016, which we'll share with you at Investor Day. But that's the key driver there.
Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Then also, Steven, can you provide us any sort of number on Tesoro's exposure to the low carbon fuel standard credits in California? It looks like pricing for those credits is up to about $64 a credit in September. It's only $25 a credit earlier this year. Is there any way that we can have a sensitivity there to see the impact on Tesoro's EBITDA from the change in these regulatory price credits?
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. As we think about those types of required fees that were to pass on to consumers, it's just that. We're required to pass those along and we do that every day. And so as we look at it, we don't expect it to have a material impact on our business.
Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then a final question for Greg. I was curious if you had any thoughts on the Salt Lake refining market going forward. On the product side, we have a couple of refinery expansions coming through this year. And then on the crude side, we've seen a fall in – Utah rig counts have fallen and Utah crude production. Are we being set up here for structurally lower Salt Lake refining margins going forward? And just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. So to answer your second question first, there is no question that the waxy crude oil production has been significantly impacted by the price. And I think to the best of my knowledge there are no rigs drilling for waxy crude oil in Utah at this time. So we've seen good supply of waxy crude oil in 2015, and I think I mentioned in my comments that during the month of – during the third quarter, excuse me, we ran about 20,000 barrels a day of waxy crude oil in Salt Lake.

Our plans for 2016 is we've looked at sourcing crude and that we're going to have good supplies of waxy crude oil, but below what we would like to be able to run. So we've sourced waxy crude oil, but not to the level. I mean, we have capacity to run that we've demonstrated by our project far greater quantities of waxy crude oil than we ever have in the past, but those aren't going to be available. So that definitely is going to be, not as available as it has in the past, but we have got good waxy crude oil supply for 2016.
On the capacity expansions in Salt Lake, Utah is a very seasonal – that region is a very seasonal market driven by high demand in the summer and less demand in the winter. And from our standpoint, because we drive a very integrated value chain, we're able to take our production and put it into our marketing outlets across the whole system, which is going into the Utah area, and then going North and West up into the Eastern part of Washington, and then down into our outlets in Nevada.
So, we have the capability to absorb our production into our system and that's the value of our integrated business. And we'll have to see what happens with other changes out there over time. I don't know. We'll see what happens to those changes.

Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Yeah. Good morning, guys.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Evan.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, I mean looking some follow-up to the prior strategic questions and maybe broader in scope. I mean Greg, you've been a very strategic thinker as a CEO and you've made a series of attractive transactions in various different directions. The upstream market, to some extent the midstream market is under incredible stress. Your results speak for themselves. I mean how do you see the opportunities that are – the strategic landscape, or see the scope to be more transformative in this environment, particularly given a reasonably optimistic outlook on refining your base margin business?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Probably all I can add to your question from other comments earlier, Evan, is that I think as a company, we take a step back and we look at the market where we are. We're very focused on how we can create value. We understand what we need to do and how we can create value no matter what segment it's in. So what's more important to us is how we drive that integrated value, because across that value chain, the way we invest capital and also by the way we make decisions to optimize the assets, it's a fundamental driver of value creation for us.
So as we look at opportunities, as I mentioned earlier to maybe – I can't remember if it was Doug or someone that asked a question about the different opportunities – we are looking at unbelievable numbers of things to be able to say how do we strengthen our business position, no matter where it is in that value chain. And the opportunities are – there's some very, very interesting opportunities. Some of them are small, and some of them are larger in scale. But we continue to look at those things. And we're fairly confident that over time, we'll be able to capture and deliver very accretive opportunities for our shareholders...
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
In your career -
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. I mean but in your career with a broader perspective, I mean, have you seen, there's this incredible dislocation, right, in terms of the upstream to the downstream, and the changing of the business model of Tesoro. Maybe if you've had any thoughts of maybe putting it in a broader historical context, because it seems every deal comes down to the particulars. It just seems as though a very opportunistic kind of market is what I would say.

Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I wouldn't disagree with you. I think it is very opportunistic, but you have to have ideas and then really dig into those ideas to see what the drivers are, and how you can create value, so probably not doing a very good job of answering your question. It's kind of a difficult question on an earnings call to talk about so.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
That's fair enough.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think it is. I think it's an interesting environment and how you look at things has to be considered over time, not for today, but over time. And I think that's what the most important thing. How do you think they fit into the structure of things that are going on that you can find either a niche or an edge there to create value over time and that's what we are trying to do?
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. I appreciate your comments. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, good morning.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Roger.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess quick question for you. I don't think anybody has asked it. I was wondering, in California, we've seen some discussions that the LCF is leading at least some or the other wholesale players to change their pricing structure. I was wondering if you could give us any clarity on kind of the impacts – 2014 to 2015, 2015 to 2016 here with the LCF and whether or not that's going to impact margins in any way for you?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I think just to be clear – and Steven addressed this a little bit earlier – the regulatory environment in California that's placing additional cost as a result of emissions, our view is, are being passed on to the consumer; in some places very clearly passed on, and the money is turned over to the state by the way that we do that. And our view is that where we are today and the things that are changing over time, that that will continue to be the case.
There's some – some of those – I think when you're referring to the low carbon fuel standard, there are actually some uncertainty from a regulatory standpoint of what actually is ultimately going to happen in that – not in the short-term, but probably in the little bit more in the intermediate term. But in general, I think the comment is that those additional emission costs are being borne by the consumer.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And kind of a change of direction here. The comments in the press release on the strategic update – and I apologize if some of this has been asked before – but I just wanted to understand, in terms of the logistics side of the business, the $255 million and then there is commentary about the $213 million, which is clearly being driven by the growth in the higher processing volumes, and it sounds like just general movement of natural gas.
How much of that is sort of a market share gain growth that was already in place? Is there any risk of a lack of underlying growth in gas supply in that region that could impact your growth expectations in 2016 and 2017?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. You have to look at all the – we have three primary segments in our logistics company. We have our refined products segment, which is the biggest part of the business. And that's very stable and there's some opportunities in that part of the business.
Our crude oil gathering and pipeline business has continued to grow. And even in a difficult environment because of where our assets are and our ability to source crude from those assets into our refining system, we see the potential to continue to grow and even expand that business into certain areas.

And then the natural gas business, because it's primarily concentrated in the Rocky Mountain area has been solid. And we see solid performance there. And the opportunities we see, which Steven alluded a little bit earlier in his comments about the capital program, some of them being impacted by timing, but the fundamental drivers are different than what we saw there. So we see continued solid performance in our natural gas business.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So is it reasonable to assume you do have market share growth in that region then?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Definitely market share growth in the crude oil business. Maintaining our position in the natural gas business and as some of our customers have grown their production, we maintain their – their growth drives our growth.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
Hi, Greg. Good morning.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Paul. How are you doing?
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
Fine, thank you, sir. It sounds like you're doing good as well – doing well, I should say. Greg, we had an interesting conversation in January about the crude market and then about the positioning of the Saudis (60:57). Could you just give us your latest thoughts on, things like the declines that we are likely to see in the Bakken and how that will affect you? You mentioned to me in January crude competition in the Pacific basin has been potentially very impactful in this market share war environment. I'd just be very interested by your latest views. Thanks.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Probably Paul, not a lot different. I mean, we're seeing very competitive pricing of foreign crude oils into the West Coast from the Middle East and actually other places. And our ability to take some different grades of crude, which helps drive our business improvement opportunities has been very good. We're working on ways to continue to enhance the delivery costs of those crudes in that and making very good progress.
So the overall market environment is – there is no question whether the impact on prices has had an impact on some of the differentials. But in general, the ability to get the supply and take other types of crude oil into our system has worked out extremely well and our ability to get crude from the Middle East is very attractive.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
I guess you're talking about tanker rates, is that what you're referring to there?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Not just tanker rates, but really what we're trying to do to optimize the supply cost, so once we get the crude into our system, how we can take advantage of supply multiple refineries with crude from like the VLCCs and things we're doing to actually – to even – we're working on some pretty creative things that we haven't done yet on the West Coast that will allow us to get even lower delivery costs into the system that we'll talk more about next year. But really focused on, how do you capture some cost savings by the actual delivery of the crude oil into our system regardless of that, how the crude is priced in that.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. And then can you just – a follow-on will just be on rail economics and how the whole rail strategy now looks.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So for us, it's primarily bringing Bakken crude oil to the West Coast. First, we're very confident that the pressure on the cost along that whole distribution system, from loading to unloading and rail rates and railcar costs and all that are under a lot of pressure. And they aren't going to come down pretty significantly in our view over time here, which will further improve the competitiveness specifically of moving Bakken crude oil into the West Coast. And so how we think Bakken crude oil will trade relative to the alternatives of primarily going to the middle part of the country or to the Gulf Coast, the rail economics will still be supportive of taking it to the West Coast.

Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. See you in December, Greg. Thanks.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2015 Tesoro Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jen, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Sam Ramraj, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Sreeram Ramraj - Vice President-Investor Relations
Good morning, and welcome to today's conference call to discuss the second quarter 2015 earnings. Joining me are Greg Goff, Chairman and CEO, and Steven Sterin, Executive Vice President and CFO.
While we will not be referencing slides during the call, we do have a set of slides which was filed with the SEC yesterday. These slides, along with other financial disclosure and reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures, should help you in analyzing the results and can be found on our website at tsocorp.com.
Please refer to the forward-looking statement in the earnings slides, which says statements made during this call that refer to management's expectations and/or future predictions are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Act, as there are many factors which could cause results to differ from our expectations.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Steven.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Sam. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'll review our second quarter financial performance, then hand the call over to Greg.
Yesterday we reported record quarterly earnings for Tesoro. Second quarter 2015 net earnings from continuing operations was $586 million or $4.62 per diluted share compared to $224 million or $1.70 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2014. EBITDA for the second quarter was approximately $1.2 billion. This was a record for the company and represents an increase of 118% from $548 million last year.
Before discussing operating results, I'd like to note a change in reporting within our Refining and Retail segments. We have combined wholesale and retail operations into one segment now referred to as Marketing, which reflects our current business model and shows the combined value of the sales channels we use to reach our customers. In our supplemental financial and operational information that's provided on our website, you can find historical results reflecting the new reporting structure.
Refining segment's EBITDA for the second quarter of 2015 was $875 million, an increase of 90% from $461 million a year ago. This is primarily attributable to a significantly improved margin environment, lower operating expenses, and contributions from our business improvements.
Our total Refinery throughput for the quarter was 783,000 barrels a day or 92% utilization. In April and May, utilization was impacted by maintenance activities at our Salt Lake City and Anacortes refineries and the restart of our Martinez refinery following the labor disruptions. We are pleased with how our assets operated towards the end of the quarter. In June, our overall utilization exceeded 100%.

The Tesoro Index was $21.61 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015 with a realized gross refining margin of $19.13 a barrel or 89% of the Tesoro Index. This compares to a realized gross refining margin of $13.11 per barrel or 101% of the Tesoro Index last year. This quarter's capture rate was impacted by various factors, including our refinery downtime including the turnarounds I mentioned, less advantaged crude oil differentials particularly in the mid-continent, and running more intermediate feedstock in our California and Pacific Northwest refineries due to our turnarounds.
Manufacturing costs in the second quarter of 2015 decreased $0.30 per barrel over last year to $5.58. This decrease was primarily due to lower energy prices.
The Logistics segment EBITDA was $154 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $65 million for the same period last year; this represents an increase of approximately 137%. This improvement was driven by the Rockies natural gas business which delivered $66 million of EBITDA and increased volumes in our crude oil gathering business.
The declared general partner distributions are approximately $18 million for the second quarter and $32 million through the first half of 2015. The total general partner and limited partner distributions received by Tesoro were about $81 million during the second quarter and $114 million for the first six months of the year.
The Marketing segment's EBITDA was $223 million, up 128% from $98 million in the second quarter of last year. This is primarily a result of strong consumer demand as Retail fuel volumes in the second quarter increased 3% over last year and are up 3.3% since the beginning of the year.
With the bulk of our planned turnarounds behind us, we're looking forward to running our refineries at high utilization rates in the second half of the year and capturing attractive market conditions driven by strong consumer demand. We expect overall utilization rates in the third quarter to be between 95% and 100%, and capture rates to improve compared to the second quarter.
We had strong cash generation in the second quarter and we expect this to continue in the third quarter. We continue to deploy cash to create value for our shareholders and during the second quarter, we returned more than $300 million to shareholders including the purchase of nearly 2.8 million shares for $250 million and payment of about $53 million in dividends. Currently, we have $731 million remaining on our authorized $1 billion share repurchase program and we'll continue to buy back shares opportunistically.
We announced a dividend increase of approximately 18% to $0.50 per share from our current dividend. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1 billion, an increase of more than $0.5 billion from the first quarter.
Our sources and uses of cash can be found on the set of slides we published yesterday, which also outline our second quarter results and third quarter outlook. In the set of slides we provide details of our planned throughput, manufacturing cost per barrel, and other elements related to our third quarter outlook.
We're very pleased with our results in the second quarter and look forward to continuing to drive earnings growth in the third quarter and the rest of the year by focusing on running our refineries safely and reliably, capturing value across our integrated business model, executing on our business improvement programs, and being financially disciplined. This allows us to continue to grow the business and return cash to shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Steven. We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter. We achieved record levels of EBITDA, net income and EPS, and returned in excess of $300 million to shareholders. Also, we delivered over $325 million in business improvements in the first half of the year.

Turning to operations. Our Refining business was supported by favorable economic factors, declining energy prices, improved product cracks, and higher demand, despite weaker crude oil differentials. As a result, the Tesoro Index in the second quarter averaged over $21 per barrel. Natural gas prices declined approximately 40% in the second quarter and this translated to lower energy costs for our refining operations.
U.S. gasoline demand continues to benefit from the peak driving season. Additionally, we see positive indicators in the marketplace from lower gasoline prices, higher vehicle miles traveled and increased auto sales. U.S. vehicle miles traveled in May increased to 275 billion miles, which is a record. This was aided by an improving labor market and lower gasoline prices.
The California economy is strong and the market continues to improve. For instance, the unemployment rate in California declined to 6.3% in June. Vehicle miles traveled through June increased this year to approximately 94 billion miles, up 3.2% from the same period last year, and PADD 5 gasoline demand increased by approximately 3% year-to-date and diesel demand improved by approximately 3% over last year.
Now addressing our West Coast operations, our California refineries ran well in the second quarter and throughput was 523,000 barrels per day. The Martinez refinery resumed operations in April after maintenance activities, and our Los Angeles refinery ran in excess of 100% utilization for the quarter.
The third quarter has continued to experience a very strong margin environment driven by growing gasoline demand. We are optimizing our West Coast operations to maximize gasoline production during this market and continue to maintain a very competitive position.
Shifting to our mid-continent region, our Mandan refinery performed well in the second quarter and we completed the turnaround at our Salt Lake City refinery. In addition to the turnaround, we had unplanned maintenance activities that affected normal operations in Salt Lake during June. This impacted our overall throughput, increasing operating expenses per barrel and lowered gasoline production and capture rates in our mid-continent region. This is now behind us and the Salt Lake City refinery is running at 100% capacity.
Now moving to our Logistics business. TLLP announced another strong quarter of earnings growth supported by increased volumes in its crude oil and natural gas gathering and processing operations. We completed the integration of the Rockies natural gas business in May and then closed the merger of QEPM in July.
Through the first half of the year, the Rockies natural gas business contributed $141 million of adjusted EBITDA. We anticipate the Rockies natural gas business to contribute $275 million EBITDA in 2015, which is at the upper end of the range we announced when we acquired the business late last year.
We remain focused on strategic third-party opportunities and drop-downs to grow TLLP's portfolio of logistics assets around our Western U.S. footprint. Tesoro expects to offer TLLP the opportunity to acquire crude oil and refined product storage and pipeline assets in Los Angeles in the form of a dropdown in the fourth quarter. We expect these assets to deliver annual EBITDA to TLLP in the range of $50 million to $75 million. TLLP now expects to deliver $640 million to $680 million of EBITDA for full year 2015. We are well on our way to delivering our $1 billion EBITDA target by 2017.
We are very pleased with the growth prospects of our Logistics business through the focus on growing and optimizing its stable fee-based business, expanding its backlog of high return organic growth projects and pursuing strategic third-party acquisitions and drop-down opportunities.

Now to discuss our Marketing business, this segment contributed significantly to our performance for the first half of the year and we improved our Marketing integration to 93% from 85% a year ago.
We have undertaken initiatives to realign our Marketing business. For instance, we recently transitioned our company-owned operations to multi-site operator model. We also revised our segment presentation during the quarter. Further, we are evaluating our long-term growth strategy for our Marketing business and look forward to providing an update later this year.
Now to provide you an update on our strategic projects. Through the first half of 2015, we delivered $325 million of business improvements. We remain confident in delivering on our commitment of approximately $670 million of year-over-year earnings growth from Tesoro-specific projects. We use tools like Lean Six Sigma to improve operational effectiveness, which contributed to the overall business improvements. Even though the first half of the year was challenging due to the labor disruption and maintenance activities, our teams have stepped it up and delivered on these commitments.
For the first half of the year, we delivered approximately $70 million in West Coast improvements against our goal of $95 million to $125 million for the full year. Contributing to this improvement, are benefits from our Los Angeles synergies including crude optimization, optimization from sourcing new types of crude, crude blending capabilities at the Carson crude terminal that resulted in higher throughput volumes, new cargo sharing between the Martinez refinery and Los Angeles, and improved pipeline connectivity between the Los Angeles refinery sites. We have continued our efforts to increase the use of advantaged feedstocks through our system and delivered approximately $100 million in capturing margin improvements against our target of $130 million to $170 million for the full year.
This year we moved 1.6 million barrels of Bakken crude oil to Alaska in the second quarter. Bakken crude oil represented over 65% of the oil consumed by our mid-continent system. We also delivered $155 million of logistics growth through the first half of the year, putting us on track to deliver the $325 million to $375 million of logistics improvements for the full year.
As for an update on individual projects, the Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, or EFSEC, has indicated that the draft environmental impact statement for Vancouver Energy has been pushed back four months to the end of November.
We remain committed to the proposed 360,000 barrel per day crude oil to rail marine terminal. We believe a thorough evaluation will clearly demonstrate that we can design, construct, and operate a safe, environmentally responsible facility that offers several benefits to the state and the region including: reducing America's dependence on foreign oil, this project is designed to replace foreign imports with North American grades; generate $2 billion in economic value to the local and regional economy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
We believe that crude by rail will continue to play a vital role in delivering advantaged inland domestic crude to the West Coast. Tesoro has made significant investments in infrastructure and enhanced rail cars to support this method of delivery in a safe and responsible way. We continued to upgrade our crude oil rail fleet by adding 210 enhanced tank cars that exceed the new safety transport standards issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation on May 1 of this year.
We have also completed the second phase of the Salt Lake City expansion project in the second quarter. This expansion allows us to run additional waxy crude oil from the Uinta Basin, increase our total capacity by about 4,000 barrels per day, and run up to 26,000 barrels per day of waxy crude oil. The Salt Lake City refinery is currently processing about 22,000 barrels per day of waxy crude oil.

As for our cash flow priorities, we will continue to, one, invest in growth opportunities to further value creation. Two, focus on external growth opportunities. Three, maintain a competitive dividend and payout ratio. Four, continue to strengthen the balance sheet and move towards investment grade. And five, return excess cash to shareholders, as Steven mentioned earlier.
Let me conclude by saying that this quarter's record performance underscores our ability to efficiently optimize our assets across the value chain, leverage favorable market conditions and deliver on our commitments. With a competitive position on the West Coast and a strong focus on the growth of our Logistics and Marketing businesses, we have built a solid foundation for continued value creation.
And with that, we'll now take your questions. Operator?

The first question comes from the line of Jeff Dietert, Simmons. Please proceed.
Jeffery A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International
Good morning.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffery A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International
The second quarter earnings were all the more impressive given some of the downtime at Salt Lake and the ramp times at Anacortes and Martinez. Do you have an estimate on the EBITDA or earnings opportunity loss due to these not running at full capacity for the duration of the quarter?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we don't have that available, Jeff. But for Salt Lake City, I think you could go back and compare year-on-year 2014 to 2015 and look at the difference in the margin environment and that would give you a very good approximation because you can see the lower throughput as we typically run at 100% utilization.
Jeffery A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International
Good. If you look at the Tesoro Refining Index and a Retail Index, they're higher for July than I think any of the months that occurred during the second quarter. You mentioned better margin capture with the benefit of higher refining utilization, declining oil prices, and the impact on secondary products, lower RINs prices. It would appear that we're off to a materially better third quarter number than what Street estimates appear. Any comments on that?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think as we look forward to the third quarter, I'd probably point out two or three things. First, as Steven mentioned in his guidance, we plan to run at between 95% and 100% utilization. So if you just take the midpoint of his range of 97.5% and you look at what we ran in the second quarter because of what you mentioned regarding Salt Lake City and Anacortes coming out of turnarounds and that, we were at 92%. So that equates to about 50,000 barrels a day of additional production in Q3 versus Q2. That's one thing.
Secondly, because of coming out of that turnaround and running feedstocks and things like that, that's now cleared out of our system. And so where we had a capture rate of 89% in Q2, we expect it to be back more in the normal range for Q3. And then finally, we see the continuing market environment, good demand in our marketing system. Our demand is continuing to stay strong going into the third quarter. We just don't see anything out there that's going to change that in the short term. And therefore, with continued strong performance in Marketing and Logistics, I think when you put it all together we see a very favorable outlook for Q3 versus Q2.
Jeffery A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern, RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.

Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Morning, everyone.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hello, Brad.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Greg, obviously I'm sure you're aware of the Reuters report last week suggesting that Tesoro was looking at acquiring Holly [HollyFrontier]. Are there any comments you can make around that? And since the answer to that may be no, can you just talk about your appetite for refining acquisitions and M&A in general in the current environment?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, as you're very much aware, Brad, it's not appropriate to comment on rumors or speculation, so we'll avoid that completely. But what I will reaffirm is our strategic focus, which has been the same for five years since I've been at Tesoro. We have five strategic priorities and one of those priorities is value-driven growth and we fully intend to look for opportunities where we can acquire assets that fit in our business model and create value from those assets. And we've been doing that for the last couple years.
We will continue to look for those opportunities. We believe we're good at capturing those opportunities and integrating them. As we stated, we've fully integrated QEPM in less than six months into our business. We'll capture all of the synergies from that business and it's operating extremely well. And I think the asset acquisition in Southern California speaks for itself.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And then I was curious if you could provide more color on the movement of the wholesale business into the new Marketing segment. Is the desire there to collect that EBITDA together, maybe supporting the plan that you're going to roll out for the Retail business in the fall?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Let me ask Steven to address your question, Brad.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, as we moved to the MSO model on our Retail business, we created this Marketing segment so you can see all of our customer-facing business in one place. So that's the reporting change. But as Greg mentioned earlier, the real focus is on creating value through our strategy, being integrated. You look at the performance of that business over the last couple years, it's improved dramatically. In fact, if you look at the last 12 months, it's generated over $800 million of EBITDA on its own. And as we look forward, we're going to lay out our strategy at the end of the year, as Greg's mentioned, to create further value in the Marketing segment.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Great. And then if I could just sneak in one more. I'm curious on those business improvement goals, obviously good progress versus the targets there. Is there a benefit in those numbers from the record cracks on the West Coast? Or are they based on more of a normalized crack environment? Thanks.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
There is no benefit at all from the margin environment.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, guys and strong results.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Morning, Evan.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just a question on the buyback, I mean clearly a big quarter here and I think you alluded to what's shaping up to be another one behind it. But how should we think about a target ratio payout here? I know you've been very active, I think it was 50% of your net income in the quarter. Is that how you think about it? Or is it more flexible than that?

Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. I don't think we're as rigid as to saying that there's a payout target we want to have. We want to continue to improve our total shareholder return. But when we think about our overall capital allocation priorities, we're really committed and focused on driving more free cash flow growth. So having high returns on our cash investments, so being very disciplined there.
Then second behind that, we say we want to have about $600 million to $800 million of cash on our balance sheet. And if you look at where we are at the end of the second quarter and you're comments on the third quarter about the business improving, we've actually got flexibility there because we've got more cash at that point than the $600 million, $800 million.
Beyond those core elements, our first priority is really to continue to fund these high growth investments, the business improvement projects, high growth capital, and also M&A. Beyond that, we continue to grow our dividend. We announced an 18% increase which follows a 42% increase in the first quarter. And then we look to share repurchases, and this year we bought back $270 million, and we're going to continue to buy back shares from the excess cash.
And then finally, I'd say we do want to continue to move towards investment grade. So putting some cash towards modest deleveraging over time makes sense as well. So that's kind of how we view it across the spectrum.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And if I could, a second. Greg, maybe I know you addressed in your opening comments, some of the trend and they extended into the third quarter, but maybe just if I could get your longer-term view of how industry fundamentals are shaping up? Clearly there's, even more recently, there's been a broader acceptance, a realization of a lower for longer, or some level of lower for longer on the oil side as well as a resiliency of U.S. production and the producer. And I guess in that, in a macro perspective, we're seeing refining start-ups internationally get kicked further to the right, and particularly in China.
How do you feel about, being in the industry for a long period of time, how do feel about the refining fundamentals as we extend through 2016 timeframe, a little bit maybe longer-term view?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, it's a good question, Evan. The shorter-term view going out for the next 12 months to 24 months, we believe the fundamentals are continuing to be very supportive, particularly if, as you mentioned, with the – if crude oil stays in the lower price range that we've experienced, we would see supportive demand, especially in the United States. May not see the same level of growth, but that's probably not necessarily a bad thing if we can maintain the demand where it's been. And with some minor growth, we would see that to lend itself to be very supportive for the industry.
And probably more importantly, for our business, if you take PADD 5 and you just look at we've had continued growth out of the recession of the California economy in particular has improved growth in demand in that. So the market is in a very favorable position, and with our focus on being able to go out and drive the improvements and capture the synergies on the West Coast, we believe that we're very well positioned to operate extremely well and deliver the products in that favorable market environment.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And does the distillate gasoline relationship concern you and then the relatively diverging fundamentals and how they relate going forward?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Not from our standpoint, because the things that we've been doing have allowed us to keep that flexibility to produce what the market needs whether it be gasoline or distillate, which will be driven, as you know, by the, the market will tell you what to produce. So from our flexibility that we're creating in our system, we're not impacted by it at all because we haven't spent a lot of money to create that flexibility.

Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I appreciate the comments, guys. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh, JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Phil.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC
A couple of follow-up questions. First, just on the last topic, I guess I'm wondering if we think about the West Coast, specifically there's the demand factors you mentioned there, there are supply factors as well. If for example, Torrance were to restart tomorrow, would your view of the Tesoro Index – would it be higher than it was at the December Analyst Day at this stage? For the next year or two? I think you had a $10 to $12 index, and it feels like there's a lot of demand behind this as well.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
So let me just clarify one thing, Phil. The index of $10 to $12, first, was for our entire system, not just California, so just to be clear about that.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
But I think today looking forward versus last year where we were actually with a fair amount of uncertainty because of the environment we were in with falling prices and that, and there's probably a little bit to follow-up on Evan's question and points that he tried to make. It appears that the fundamentals are even more supportive. So I think when you see us come out with our estimate for next year, it will probably be higher from an index standpoint as we look forward from the markets. So yeah, we see that in a very positive way.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And just on the capture rate discussion. Do you happen to have what the June capture rates were? Or some way of calibrating a little bit more finely how you would think about capture versus the 89% given more of a full run rate. And if I drill into that a little bit more obviously the mid-con, you highlighted some of the challenges there in the second quarter. But are there any factors going on in the mid-con that are more structural? I'm thinking up in the Mandan area with maybe slower diesel demand that would lead to slightly lower capture there maybe versus 2014?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So it'd be probably June. I don't have that number off the top of my head, but I would say that June is probably a good indication for Q3 from a capture standpoint. And if you go back and look historically at what our capture's been, that will get you in the ballpark of what it is. However, you do have to recognize that capture will be down slightly because of the change in taking some of the Marketing business and moving it into Refining. And then the change we talked about earlier in the year on how we account for the RIN value.
Now the RINs have come down a lot since we talked about that earlier in the year. But those two changes could probably take our capture down slightly in the mid-single digit percentage value. So I guess as kind of an approximate value target around 5% as a lower level. So I think that would give you a good idea of what capture would look like going forward.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Then just anything on the mid-con, specific?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Probably the biggest thing in the mid-con is just the weaker Bakken differential.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake, Credit Suisse. Please proceed.

Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Great, thanks, and congrats. It is clear Q3 is going to be somewhat even stronger.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Ed.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Just a hypothetical, if you owned any SP at one of your refineries and you blew it up and had to get a secondary one in, and you needed to get a waiver, what odds – you know the regulatory regime better than us – what odds would you put on getting that waiver? I mean, we're all trying to work it out.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
That's an absolutely unfair question, Ed.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I mean I'd just be, you know honestly, I'd just be speculating on that. I don't think I can give you any better indication than anyone else on that.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Right. Okay. Maybe then I'll move into a different area. I mean obviously you've been quite aggressive on the MLP consolidation front. I mean I'm sure you've observed that the MLP valuations are further coming in. Is the organization, because you're still I guess digesting QEPM, or doing very well with that. Is the organization stretched to this point to do – to participate further in consolidation, or is that still one of the levers that you think you could pull?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Actually, we feel very good about QEPM. We did an excellent job of integrating it into our business, the people that joined Tesoro from QEPM are an excellent addition to our organization, their commitment and their strong technical and operating background fit exactly what we needed for our logistics business. So we feel very, very good about that. And in less than six months, it's fully integrated into our business and running along, and it's been fantastic from that standpoint.
So we're well-positioned for other opportunities. We mentioned, briefly, that we see significant organic growth opportunities, even though it is a difficult environment with pricing, prices for both gas and oil. We continue to see good organic growth projects and working with customers across the areas where we do the business is still bearing a lot of fruit for us. So we're very optimistic from that standpoint. We continue to look for opportunities to acquire assets that fit in, that are good quality assets that fit our business model, and we'll just see what happens as that goes forward.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah. And then maybe if I could come back to the West Coast just finally. Torrance I mean obviously at the margin – there's some gasoline that's not coming in, it was a big unit, so that does tip it. But if Torrance was fully running, do you still think that we'd be seeing stress in California because of the demand fundamentals that we're witnessing?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think you have to, as you know, you have to go back in and look at the amount of gasoline that's been imported into PADD 5 during the time that they've had operating problems at that refinery and see what the net effect is, that would give you an idea of what would happen because there's been a fair amount of imports into the area. So it's probably had some impact in the marketplace, but I think the market is being fully supplied with all of the product that it needs.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Thanks very much.

Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate, Bank of America. Please proceed.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on a great quarter, Greg. I wanted to pick your brain a little bit on your teaser on the Retail business. And obviously I knew you were going to give us details later in the year, but I guess just as a big picture standpoint, it's being a strategic outlet for gasoline for you guys for quite a while. Obviously, it's grown in stature. You've stepped that up over time. Is it something you see as strategic that you need to retain ownership of? Or is it the kind of thing you believe could stand on its own two feet like, say, as a standalone Retail business or IPO spun out to investors, for example?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think the first point that's more important than your question I think is that we believe it's critical that we maintain that high integration in our Refining and Marketing business. It's a fundamental part of our business model. So first, that's extremely important.
The second part of your question is something that we need to look at and say how do you get the optimal contribution from that business with the amount of money that you deploy in that business as well as how you can capture returns on that? And that is something we fully intend to answer here and we'll share with everyone before the end of the year.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Just a quick follow-up. Is it reasonable to assume that you could spin it out while still retaining the distribution rights, if you like, to the what I guess is predominantly a jobber market? Is that a fair assumption?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Doug, I think just give us time to complete our work on it and we'll look at – as you know, you know how we do things. We're going to look at every possible idea and we're going to be focused on how do we create the maximum value for the owners of the company? And then we'll – but we'll take what you just said and look at that with every other option that we can think of.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. Thank you. My follow-up is really more about the structure of the gasoline market in California. I guess given the strength that we've seen in margins, obviously Torrance has been offline and so on, why do you think we haven't seen a bigger step-up in imports into the region to calm things down, if you like? Are there some structural barriers, whether it be port facilities or things of that nature, which I recall are predominantly owned by the local refineries, or is there some other issue going on aside from the obvious strength in demand? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
First, I think you need to look at the entire PADD because, as you know, products, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel moves freely along the whole West Coast to the different markets and that. So that's one thing. Secondly, if you look at gasoline production, it has been very strong in PADD 5 during this period of time. It's been extremely strong because the market needs the gasoline. And to the best of my knowledge, everyone has met the demand for gasoline on the West Coast. We have not had any issues of supplying any of our customers at all, and even earlier in the year when we had our operating challenges at the Martinez refinery we still met all of our customer demand. So I'm not aware of any shortages of not meeting the customer demand in that.
And I think the question on imports is a little bit to do with the market structure and pricing, and when you're in a backwardated market like that, it may present some challenges to get the gasoline into the market. But the market's been absorbing imports without any problem.

Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
All right. Appreciate the answers. Thanks, Greg.

Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Good morning, Greg.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Neil.
Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.
So, Greg, I wanted to start off on the MLP here and you'll be generating a lot of general partner cash flow that's going to start ticking up here and just your thoughts on whether it makes sense to monetize some of that GP. And then also as a follow-up, just your thoughts on the pacing of dropdowns into TLLP as you think about your backlog.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I'm going to ask Steven to comment a little bit on the GP monetization, then I'll respond to your second question, Neil.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, very similar to Greg's comments about how we create value on the Marketing side, we view the TLLP business the same way. We're really focused on growing the business organically and through dropdowns. To your point, where we are in terms of the growth, we see substantial cash flow growth already coming from the business and we expect it to continue. Beyond that, whether there's opportunities to create value through other means, we hope that the most value comes to our shareholders by just operating the business extremely well and growing it. But over time, if we feel that doesn't yield value, we'll look at all the options that are out there on the financial side.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
On the second one, Neil, regarding the dropdowns, as you are very much aware that we announced in the second half of the year here we intend to do a dropdown, and we talked about the scale of that dropdown, and how the frequency of those dropdowns is for us predicated a little bit upon just the time that it takes to do all the work to get the dropdowns ready to happen in conjunction with everything else we have going on in the Logistics business with our, execution of our organic growth projects and we're doing extensive business development with our customers to meet their needs out in the marketplace.
So that is one of the things that controls our dropdown schedule, which is kind of gets us on one dropdown a year. We've said that. However, this time, we've done additional work to accelerate dropdowns that could happen in 2016 because we've just been, it just takes a lot of work to get those ready. As so there is a chance we could do a little bit more dropdowns in 2016 than we have in the past.
Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.
All right. Great. And then my follow-up on the M&A point, just philosophically, Greg, you talk about taking a value approach when you think about M&A. Are there regions of greater interest, whether it's the mid-con versus the Gulf Coast versus elsewhere? Obviously, there are market power constraints in PADD 5. And then just if you could talk and flesh through some of those parameters that you define as a value creative transaction, I think that would be helpful for framing the topic for investors.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
So we have been very clear for the last five years that our area of focus is from the middle part of the country to the West Coast and pretty much staying out of the Gulf Coast. And we believe that the best way that we create value is in our integrated business model between Refining, Marketing, and Logistics. And as you're very much aware, that doesn't necessarily apply on the Gulf Coast like it does in the geographic area that I defined. So we've stayed true to that geographic area for the last five years, and right now, I don't see us changing from that. That's our focus. We think we understand the business and the opportunities in that area, and we'll continue to focus on that area.

What we believe from a value, way to create values, if we were to find opportunities, they would be where we can capture opportunities from deploying the way we operate on a business that we would, an asset that we would acquire. For example, what we did at Carson, we would intend to do the same thing. We, as the synergies that we've talked about and shared fairly transparently the types of synergies, we would look for those opportunities that create value that are kind of embedded in the business, which depend a lot upon how we operate, which can include the commercial part of the business from a crude supply and product to the taking product out to the customers. And then just as much as how we operate. So we'd have to find that type of embedded value in there and we believe that there's significant opportunities to be able to do that. And then the other thing would be just being able to build out our business model. That, we believe, there is a part of our value creation model that we would look to achieve.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng, Barclays. Please proceed.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, guys.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Paul.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Greg, on the M&A, if I could ask an additional question. Is there one or two financial metrics that are the most important when you consider M&A transactions? And if there are, what are those, and what is the minimum in those metrics that you would be looking for?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think, Paul, we, I think if you look over time, most refining transactions that have occurred come into a pretty close range on a DCF basis. So when we acquired Carson, you can go back and see the business on a discounted cash flow basis where that value is in there. They stay in a relative, a pretty tight range from the work that we've done on those. So looking at opportunities, we'd be looking at them from a discounted cash flow basis.
And then the second thing would be, which I hopefully tried to answer Neil's question, is there embedded value in the business by the way that you operate or in some cases extend what we would try to do with our business model. And so we do a pure grind out the numbers and see what type of value creation we can get through synergies and that based upon how – what we pay for the business.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And in your discounted cash flow analysis, what is the discount rate you guys are using?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think over time if you look over the last little bit from the work we've done, most transactions traded around 15%.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Greg, several of your major projects including the mixed xylene project, Carson, and Wilmington that you're going to shut down the FCC and expand the hydrocracker as well as build a tunnel to connect the two refinery physically. Do you already have all the required permits on the construction on those projects? Or are you still waiting for some?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
So on every project that we would consider kind of a major strategic effort by the company, including Vancouver Energy, the mixed xylene project that you mentioned, Paul, the Los Angeles integration project, every single project is in a different stage of the permitting process. So we are moving all of those projects through the permitting process as we speak.
That is very critical from the implementation because you've seen some of the troubles that we've had with getting through the permitting process at Vancouver Energy. We aren't seeing those same issues at the other projects but they are in the permitting process.

Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Can you share that when you think or that based on your – to get those two projects, that the L.A. Carson integration and also that the mixed xylene to be on stream in 2017, when you would need the permit to be acquired?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
You need the permits early, end of this year, early next year to stay on our schedule. And right now we're moving along that time line. We don't see any issues at this stage but that's the critical milestone in the project.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And, Greg, since the (47:27) publicly (47:28) on the QEPM, is there any plan to merge it into TLLP so that you only have one logistic MLP?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We completed that merger, Paul, about the third week of July, so QEPM is fully merged into TLLP. It actually went very, very smoothly and that's all behind us. It's done.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Excellent. A final one. Do you have a preliminary CapEx for 2016? And also that how's your spring 2016 turnaround schedule may look like?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think right now I don't have off the top of my head what we said at our analyst meeting in December of 2014 with regards to 2016 but that's probably a good ballpark number right now. I just don't remember what that is. We're working our turnarounds. Right now we're in our planning process for 2016 going forward. So it's just too early to get an idea of what our turnaround schedule is.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Greg, can you at least tell us whether you think it's going to be about normal or if it's going to be heavier or lighter than normal? Or even that is too early to tell?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think a good indication would be kind of average, Paul. I don't think from my recollection, we have done some work to do some work on the turnarounds and that, and I think that when we get into 2016, you'll see it comparable to 2015 would be my guess.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin, Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC
Good morning.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Sam.
Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC
I just wanted to revisit this gasoline import topic quickly. If you could educate us just a little bit on some of the dynamic at work here, if – when these barrels land at port, if they're ready for market immediately or if they potentially require further processing within the California system so that there's in fact another constraint beyond just ship and port capacity as international refiners try to close that ARP?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
You can import California gasoline and take it directly to the market it does not require further processing. However, people can import feedstocks to blend in to create additional gasoline and that – both of those may happen, but your first question is you can take it directly to the market.
Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks very much. And then on just also revisiting the MLP valuation theme because I think this week it's really come to the forefront for a lot of people. On consolidation, it seems like one of the constraints in the past has just been the spread between third-party M&A transactions and the dropdown valuation so that the limited partners really had to fund a lot of the upfront consolidation costs. But now as that gap closes, how do you think about the Tesoro parent company balance sheet and the role it might play in potential pure midstream acquisition opportunities outside a comparable transaction to, say, Southern California two years ago, but just TSO parent in its current position with respect to third-party midstream assets and in consideration of how it affects the GP too, if that has a TSO parent?

Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, I think your first question for our call was really around the fundamental valuations. When you think about them from a third-party versus dropdown at the end of the day they're really all third-party transactions. If you take for example our QEPM acquisition in the first year based upon the earnings run rate we've been able to achieve in the business it's already down to about a 10 to 10.5 multiple and historically that had been the level at which we had dropdown assets too, and so from our point of view they're both very, very attractive to LP unit holders as well as GP. So that's kind of the first perspective.
To your second question, how we think about dropping down assets, Greg described the pace at which we've talked about it. It really is around – we'll drop down assets to continue to support the growth but it's really about creating additional value, being able to run those assets. There's times where we could bring third parties into those assets as well.
And so when we look at the type of assets we bring down, you can expect them to be very consistent with the type of assets we've dropped before and each year you have to look at the dynamics around valuation and so you know we still think that you can drop down these type of midstream assets at valuations that make sense today and they're still accretive and valuable to LP unit holders and they still make sense for refining so we haven't seen the shift off of that.
Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. And just out there in the M&A market, are we seeing assets close the gap to the dropdown valuation so that you can warehouse them in the parent company for a certain amount of time? As you drop them down gradually, should you see assets that look attractive to you outside the current Tesoro footprint, if that makes sense?
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, I think ultimately you want to use Refining capital to grow Refining and to the extent you can find other sources of capital to grow the Non-Refining and Marketing businesses, you'd look at that. But yeah, I think valuations – to your point over the last few years they haven't really been supportive of that because there's been – there's really a strong bid-ask spread on those deals, but I do think that that's an option we'll always look at is being able to warehouse it and drop it down, you know particularly when it's integrated with Refining assets like our Southern California acquisition. That made a lot of sense, created a lot of value.
Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks so much.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chi Chow, Tudor Pickering. Please proceed.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me okay, Greg?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, a little bit of a buzz on your phone, but yeah, you're good.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay, yeah, I think I'm having problems here. I guess on the midstream drop you mentioned to TLLP, you've mentioned the assets are in Los Angeles. I was under the impression that TLLP already held all the L.A. assets. Are these still related to Carson or do have something else in that region?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
No, it's part of the – both of Wilmington. We have more assets both around Wilmington and Carson that are distribution assets that fit into the system.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Is there more beyond what you've identified in the release today?

Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Yes there is.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. And do you have any sort of EBITDA estimate on what's still yet to come?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Chi, not on those yet, but there are others there, so I don't know what it is exactly.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. At Salt Lake City, regarding your expansion project there, can you continue to process the 22-a-day of waxy crudes longer term? Or are you going to have to cut back on those volumes from your supplier once your competitor in that region starts up their expansion next year?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, I think I'm not sure the competitor has much to do with the supply of waxy crude as it does what's going out in the Uinta Basin. And there's no question that the drilling activity has dried up out in the Uinta Basin and that's going to have an impact on future availability of waxy crude oil. So there was a fair amount of waxy crude oil being produced and used in a number of the Salt Lake City refineries and taken out of the region. And so we're working through that right now to get an indication of the availability of waxy crude oil going out, looking further to see what's going to be available. But we have flexibility to use other types of crudes and all that. It's just how the waxy crude oil prices into the system. It's just a little bit too early to see how that's going to shake out for 2016 and beyond.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Do the economics on the project change much if you use non-waxy crudes through the expansion?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Our project, Chi, was built to run waxy crude oil. That was the rationale for spending the amount of money that we did, was to be able to process waxy crude oil. As you can recall, I think at about the time we were working on this, if my memory serves me right we were around 10,000 barrels to 11,000 barrels a day and we basically said we were going to double that up to the 22,000 barrels. It looks like we're at about 24,000 barrels to 26,000 barrels a day. And so there is no question that if two things happen – one, if less waxy crude is available, and two, if the differentials come in in the short term, that economics that originally were behind that project are not as attractive as they were when we spent the money.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then final question on Vancouver. Do you read into anything on the State's sentiment on the project by pushing their process back even further? Or is this just typical regulatory inefficiencies?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. From our view is it's the way that the many different groups within the States that are involved in the EFSEC process are doing the work and it just doesn't work as you would both hope for it and like it to work. If it was in a business you would probably get a different outcome versus going through the regulatory process. But we do not read anything into it regarding their support or lack of support for it.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thanks, Greg. I appreciate it.

Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Sankey, Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
Hi, Greg. Good morning.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Paul. How are you doing?
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC

Gosh, man. It feels like it should be Friday, for sure. Greg, I assume you're having an analyst meeting in December, right?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
That is correct.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
If we look back to last December, I know the world was kind of already changing at that time, but it still feels – if I listen, and I have to obviously check through the transcript, but it still feels that essentially what you're doing here is either reiterating or possibly raising kind of everything that you laid out at that meeting? I just wanted – I know you'll know the answer right off the top of your head. Is that broadly speaking true? Is there any elements of what you said in December that are drifting?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
No, I think your recollection is right on. We kind of today said that we're going to go on the high end of the range of, for example, on the three areas that we targeted to create value. Last year, we gave a range as we were developing our plans, and today we feel confident that we will be on the high end of that range. And so very, very encouraging.
And furthermore, what we're looking at into 2016, because we also gave a preliminary indication of value that we felt like we could contribute in 2016. And we've already captured some opportunities that will start to bear fruit in 2016. So I'm actually quite encouraged about the outlook for 2016 from a overall what we do at Tesoro to create value versus all of the discussions we've been having about the market.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah, and I know you well enough to know that if there was anything that was kind of going awry as regards to what you'd laid out, you'd just tell us. And so essentially what you're doing is you're – everything is towards the upper end of the range that you had laid out at that time?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think the only thing that doesn't look as attractive as what we thought last year was response to the last question that Chi asked around Salt Lake City. And part of our, you know, we spent a lot of money. We spent a little bit less than $400 million to create the value at Salt Lake primarily driven by processing waxy crude oil, and in the short-term, that doesn't look as attractive. But everything else I think we feel very comfortable with.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. And I guess what I'm driving at ultimately is that there's obviously been remarkable changes in the market. A couple of things are obvious, and one of them obviously benefits you which is the demand side has been strong. But the differentials have collapsed. The NGL story is horrendous, and the MLP issue has been raised, but you're still able to actually just sort of sail on with a raised outlook. What have been the big – I mentioned demand obviously being a positive, but it just strikes me that it's kind of remarkable that you're able to do this given the scale of the changes. An obvious one is the Bakken differential being so much narrower. Could you just observe where the challenges lie, if you like, if there are indeed any?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think on a broad scale from a logistics standpoint, there's no question that outside the fringe areas of the Bakken that you're seeing a lot less activity. We're fortunate that we're right in the heart of the Bakken and the types of customers we have to be able to both buy crude oil from as well as work with them to help lower their costs to get their crude oil to market through our logistics activities has been very, very encouraging.
And maybe the number of opportunities may not be as great as it would have been in kind of the bull market that we were in for a while but it's very encouraging that we see a lot of really good organic growth opportunities. So from a logistics standpoint, our organic growth portfolio continues to look very good and we're – we have a number of opportunities both in North Dakota and out in the Rockies that we're working. And so we're very, very encouraged from that standpoint.

I think from a crude supply standpoint, from a cost standpoint specifically around Bakken crude oil, we've always felt that the market would become very efficient and clear to the areas based upon the transportation costs to get there. And it's in some cases it's taken time, but as we look around what's going to happen in North Dakota and how prices will set the differentials for Bakken crude oil, as that crude clears to the market, we're very confident that we can still take Bakken crude oil and source it into our system exactly like we planned on it over the last few years as a – because we believe that the cost to move that crude oil are going to reflect that what the markets tell them they need to be to be able to compete in the marketplace. And so that's kind of how we see it, Paul.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. It makes perfect sense. One delicate one just to roll – to finish it up. The Vancouver delay you mentioned, is there any end in sight to that? And I guess what you're telling me in the previous answer is that the Vancouver economics still do make sense regardless of the – I mean, right now it looks like the dips are within train economics basically.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think our view is, is that the economics – we looked as you would expect, we evaluate that all the time and we take a view on where the dips are, where there are opportunities to reduce the cost set. So we're very confident that the movement of Bakken crude oil to the West Coast will continue to make sense over time. And so we don't see any change there and our commitment to Vancouver Energy hasn't wavered from the very first day. It's just a very slow, time-consuming process that unfortunately most of it is outside of our control.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. Just to finish. Is there a deadline on the fact that it's been delayed? Or is that just a – I don't know what kind of delaying tactic – is there any kind of...
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
I wish there was.
Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Greg.

Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan, Citigroup. Please proceed.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Yeah. Good morning. It's Faisel from Citi.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Faisel.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Good morning, Greg. Just going back to Steve's comments around getting towards investment grade, can that be accomplished just through deleveraging? Or does the asset base have to be more diversified in order to get there? I thought that one of the hiccups or the issues that the rating agencies had was the concentration on the West Coast but maybe I'm wrong.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Steven will address it.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. If you do read those credit reports, they do focus on concentration on the West Coast although I think we've demonstrated both through what we've done with transforming the business through the Southern California acquisition, the way we've run the integrated business model and the improvements we've made in the logistics business that being concentrated on the West Coast is a good thing. And we believe the rating agencies are paying attention to the improvement in performance and how we manage capital there and we're able to continue to grow profitability and cash.
So we feel very, very good about the business profile and in terms of the balance sheet, our credit metrics and all that, because of the business growth have moved very, very close to investment grade. So in terms of the debt side of the balance sheet, we think there's only a need for very modest type deleveraging, a few hundred million type of thing. It's not a billion dollars. And so we think that we can both grow into it through our earnings growth and over time some modest debt repayment will get us there.

Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Got you. And on the Marketing side, the restatement here, I just want to make sure I understand this. So the wholesale business, it's the entire spot-to-rack business that's been restated out of Refining and put into Retail. Is that what I'm seeing here on the restatement?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
No. That's a little bit too broad of a definition because in there we do like a lot of unbranded just taking product to the over the racks when we have excess product. That is not included in there. It is business that's committed to customers is what the wholesale business is. So where we have contracts with specific customers, that's what the wholesale part of the business is in addition to our Retail business.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. So it's only rack-to-retail then? There's no – the spot-to-rack is still sort of within the Refining segment?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So well let me just clarify that, Faisel. So initially it was our Retail marketing business where we had our brand that was given – that customers used a brand that either Tesoro owns or we have the rights to offer to customers. That was our Retail business. So the ARCO business, the Tesoro business, the U.S.A., some Shell, some Exxon, and some Mobil. That was the legacy Retail segment that reported externally. Today in addition to that, we have customers that do not use our brand but that have contracts to buy business from us on sometimes long-term contracts and sometimes a little bit shorter term, but it's that business that's in there. Where we just go to the market and sell unbranded product over the rack, it does not include that business.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Okay, got it. And is there any breakdown in the quarter how much was the difference between the way you guys used to report before versus the way you guys report today in terms of the wholesale versus the retail?
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, we put it in our supplemental financial information and what we've done there is we've actually gone back and backcasted back to 2013 by quarter the way the segments would have looked and so you can compare that to what you've seen previously and give you a delta. In 2013, 2014 it was in the neighborhood of about $100 million a year.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. The next on the dropdown you guys are talking about in TLLP. Given that the GP cash flow is a larger cut of the cash flow stream, how do you guys think about the pricing? In the past we've seen you drop down the assets at a certain multiple, but now that the GP cash flow is higher, I guess we would normally think that the multiple would have to be lower in order to accommodate for that cash flow stream? I just want to understand philosophically how you're thinking about it.
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, I think that the first and foremost is to make sure that the overall deal economics create a lot of value for LP unit holders and the GP unit holder, and so it comes down to the quality of the assets and the sustainability of the earnings that are in there and the required capital to maintain them, so I think that drives 85% of it is good quality assets being dropped down. But we do look at, because of the way the GP and LP structures work, to make sure that both LP unit holders and GP unit holders both value greatly from these transactions. So we'll look at all mechanisms to do that.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)

Okay, last question from me. It sounded like on the call you guys were talking about there was some headwinds during the quarter to the capture rate, but it sounds like all those issues have been resolved. Is it fair to say that as we sit here in the third quarter that the ability for you to capture more of the margin is better today than it was in the second quarter?
Steven M. Sterin - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
That's correct.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the time.

The next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng, Barclays. Please proceed.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, Greg. Just a quick follow-up on the Vancouver. Is there a point if they continue to delay and push it forward that you would say okay, that we've been waiting long enough that we're going to look for an alternative option instead of say going EFSEC? Is there a red line inside the company that you guys are contemplating or that you would be looking at concurrently? And if there's an alternative option then what that option may look like.
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I was going to say something about red lines but I'd better not. So right now, Paul, I mean we're absolutely committed to Vancouver Energy and we're very confident that – the EFSEC process looks at the actual permitting process in that the overall impact of what this does to the community, to the state, to the supply of this type of crude oil to the West Coast, to the improvements in lowering carbon intensity of crude oil that's produced in the United States made into products and sold on the West Coast that are all positive.
We just believe when all of that's taken into consideration that there'll be support, that there'll be very strong support for the project. So we don't see anything at this stage that would ever tell us not to keep pursuing the project. Unless we learn something down the road that we don't know today, there's nothing that tells us we won't continue to pursue this.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.
All right. A final question. Do you have a number you can share inside your network what is the same-store sales in the third quarter so far, and the year-over-year growth?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
We talked about during the discussion earlier that our Marketing growth year-on-year was up around 3% during Q2 versus last year, and we said that it's continuing at that pace so far, whatever we are, five weeks into the third quarter, we are experiencing that same pace of growth.

Sorry, guys. Just one last question. Just want to know, in the segment data that the POP exposure, and keep-hold exposure that used to be at the midstream business at QEP, where does that sit now? Does that sit within Refining or Marketing or is it within the Corporate segment?
Gregory James Goff - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
No, the agreement between Tesoro and Tesoro Logistics to take the commodity exposure off of the NGLs is done in our Refining segment. And as we said, it's immaterial to the company.
