Passport Services

																								





Ever since the US Government passed new laws requiring passports for all travel out of the country, passport applications have been at an all-time high. This is especially true for those travelers visiting Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Receiving a passport through the US passport agency can take as long as 4-6 weeks to process - sometimes even longer. And making use of the government's "rush" service still
provides you no guarantee of getting your passport for weeks.
Passport expediting services exist to fill this gap. By paying a service fee (which varies, according to how fast you need your passport), you can receive your new or renewed passport in as little as 24 hours. This is an invaluable service for those people who have a vacation or trip planned in the near future, and therefore can't afford to take a chance that their passport will be delayed or that they won't receive
their passport in time for their trip.

Choosing a Passport Company
Passport demand has significantly increased over the last several years, creating a back log of requests and many angry travelers.  Requesting a passport through the US passport agency can take as long as four to six, or longer, to process. If you've decided to utilize a passport company to help with your passport needs be aware that these companies vary greatly in several aspects and finding a solid company,
that you can count on, for a fair price will save you time and money.
There are a variety of qualities you should compare when evaluating passport companies. Some of these include:

Turnaround Time. Some passport companies are able to expedite your passport and have it in your hands in 48 hours or less.  While others need at least 5 to 7 days to deliver a new passport.  When looking for a passport company identify what their specific turnaround times are and what each time frame costs.  You'll see a significant differences in charges across many companies.
Website Functionality. When you're searching for expert advice on what is needed for your passport renewal, what you can use in place of your missing birth certificate, how to obtain more passport pages, and more you'll want a company that offers a savvy website that is easy to use and loaded with information. Also, look for websites that provide online passport status information so
that
you may feel confident in the progress of your passport application.
Expert Advice. When you are looking for expert advice on what is needed for your passport renewal, or any other challenging questions - you'll want a company that offers plenty of information either on line or via the phone. Some companies provide everything you need to know while others are short on information and big on sales pitch.
Customer Service.  Getting your needs met, reducing your panic and answering all of your complicated passport questions is what you'll want in a company that needs to produce your passport fast.  Customer service levels between passport companies can vary greatly and you'll want to choose a company where the customer is always first. Look for companies that offer several methods of communication
and have extended hours to assist you - whenever needed.

When choosing a passport company, the internet provides the best resources for investigating and locating a quality passport company that you can feel confident with.  Consider using independent product review websites to quickly locate a strong passport company. They do a good job of quickly comparing and contrasting website functionality, prices, customer service and prior performance for you.

These investments will be used by the companies to further product development and will also provide Applied Ventures with exposure to cutting-edge and potentially disruptive technologies and related new market applications in the advanced imaging space."Oncoscope's and Passport Systems' advanced image-detection capabilities complement Applied Materials' core expertise in inspection and precision materials engineering," said Eileen Tanghal, general manager of Applied Ventures. "As a strategic investment fund, we look for opportunities to accelerate and enable new markets through collaboration and open innovation."Oncoscope's innovative optical screening technology is currently being developed to assist physicians in more targeted and efficient examination of a patient's tissue through guided biopsies.  Oncoscope is seeking FDA approval to market its device for detecting precancerous lesions of the esophagus."We are pleased to be working with Applied Ventures to leverage its extensive technical and business resources as a leading technology company," said Dr. Perry Genova, president and CEO of Oncoscope. "We believe our distinctive optical screening technology presents significant improvements to today's existing processes with the potential to help improve cancer detection as we know it."Passport Systems' proprietary automated, non-intrusive cargo screening technology uses 3-dimensional imaging detection to quickly analyze the composition of materials and accurately identify the contents of a container, including commercial items, contraband, and other materials."Applied Materials' strengths in high-energy implanters and inspection and cost-effective high-volume manufacturing will be instrumental in helping us effectively scale our business for mass-adoption in the sea, air and land cargo inspection markets," said Passport Systems CEO Robert Ledoux. "The strategic and financial support from Applied Ventures will enable us to provide cost-effective, non-intrusive inspection solutions and to ramp up manufacturing capabilities to meet customer requirements."Since forming in 2005, Applied Ventures has invested approximately $179 million in more than 50 portfolio companies spanning equipment, materials, device and process providers in the clean energy, semiconductor, display, lighting and energy storage sectors. In 2013 alone, the group invested more than $18 million, including six new investments in early stage technology companies.About Applied VenturesApplied Ventures, LLC, a subsidiary of Applied Materials, Inc., invests in early and later-stage technology companies with high growth potential that provide a window into technologies that advance or complement Applied Materials' core expertise. Applied Ventures' investments help develop technologies and markets that provide natural extensions of Applied Materials' businesses and can stimulate the growth of applications for its products and services. Applied Materials, Inc. is the global leader in providing innovative equipment, services and software to enable the manufacture of advanced semiconductor, flat panel display and solar photovoltaic products.  Learn more at www.appliedventures.com.# # #Contact:Kevin Winston (editorial/media) 408.235.4498Michael Sullivan (financial community) 408.986.7977HUG#1755934January 20, 2014

FREE TWO DAY SHIPPING OR $10 OVERNIGHT!Quick OverviewThe Escort 9500i radar detector is a revolutionary product, combining a high performance radar detector with GPS technology to practically eliminate false alerts and allow user programmable warnings for fixed red light, speed cameras, and speed traps. This model is equipped with a high intensity red display.Availability: Discontinued  $449.95  Email to a FriendThis product has been discontinued and is no longer available. It was replaced by the  Escort Passport 9500ix Radar Detector .          DescriptionAdditionalReviewsProduct DownloadsDetails   The Escort 9500i radar detector is a revolutionary product, combining a high performance radar detector with GPS technology to practically eliminate false alerts and allow user programmable warnings for fixed red light, speed cameras, and speed traps.  When you receive a false alert at a fixed location, such as a retail store, you can quickly and easily "mark" the location using the Escort 9500i's TrueLock feature. After a location is marked, you will never receive another alert in that location for that specific frequency. Also, if you have red light cameras or speed cameras in your area, you can mark the location and in the future the 9500i will always alert you as you approach that location. This is even great for common speed trap locations!  The Escort Passport 9500i is also able to offer several other unique features because of the built-in GPS. General false alert filtering is improved because the detector can now sense the speed of your vehicle - at slower speeds, sensitivity is reduced to eliminate false alerts. The Escort 9500i's SpeedAlert feature will display your current speed when it provides an alert.  The Escort 9500i also offers a unique AutoVolume feature. A built-in microphone senses the ambient noise level in the vehicle and adjusts the volume level accordingly. The 9500i has a red alpha-numeric text display and is the first product from Escort to feature voice alerts. Detection for the European Ku radar band and POP radar is also supported.  This Passport 9500i features a high intensity red display, and is also available with a brilliant blue display.  The Escort 9500i is designed to integrate with the Cincinnati Microwave ZR4 Laser Defense System. Four High-Resolution Display ModesThe Escort 9500i features a powerful display, which has 4 possible modes:  In the standard bar graph mode, the Escort 9500i will show one band that was detected and a bar graph representing the signal strength. In ExpertMeter™ mode, the 9500i can identify band and relative signal strength of up to 8 radar signals at once. In SpecDisplay™ mode, the detector will show the band and actual frequency being detected. In SpeedAlert mode, the detector will show the speed at which you are traveling.Includes SmartCord MuteDisplay™ Power CordThe SmartCord MuteDisplay™ accessory is a unique power cord with a power-on indicator, an alert lamp that warns you of radar and laser, and a convenient mute button right on the lighter plug! It's the perfect addition for any car when reaching the detector's mute button on the windshield is a stretch. Also, for discreet night driving, put your Passport 9500i detector in the dark mode, and use the SmartCord MuteDisplay™ for visual alerts. Other drivers won't know you have a detector.Includes Aluminum Travel CaseThis radar detector comes complete with a high quality aluminum travel case! This durable case is perfect for transporting your radar detector and all accessories from one vehicle to another. It is also perfect for storing your 9500i to discourage theft when you are away from the vehicle.Video ReviewEscort Passport 9500i FeaturesX, K, Ka, and Super Wideband Ka Detection360° Protection against all types of LaserInstant-On (Pulse) DetectionSelectable POP Mode DetectionSafety Warning System™ (SWS™)SmartShield® VG-2 ImmunityGPS Chipset Eliminates False AlertsTrueLock False Alert Signal RejectionMark Location Speed Trap DatabaseSpeedAlert Speed DisplayCrystal-Clear Voice AlertsDetailed SWS™ AlertsHigh Intensity Red Text DisplayBar Graph Signal Strength Indicator With 3 ModesExpertMeter™ Multiple Threat DisplayKu Band DetectionAutoSensitivity™ ModeSelectable BandsCity, Highway, and AutoSensitivity ModesEarphone JackAudio Alert Only ModeAuto and Manual MutingMaximum/Medium/Minimum/Dark Display SettingsAuto Brightness AdjustmentLow Voltage WarningBattery Voltage IndicatorAuto Memory RetentionSoftware UpgradableSpecDisplay™ Display OptionAutoVolume Automatically Adjustable Audio LevelsSmartCord Power Cord IncludedUSB PortOne Year Manufacturer WarrantyPassport 9500i Customizable FeaturesPower-on Indication - 5 ways to configure the standard display, including current speed and battery voltagePower-on Sequence - Standard/FastSpeedAlert - on/offSignal Strength Meter - Standard/ExpertMeter™/SpecDisplay™Auto Mute - on/offAutoVolume - on/offUnits - English/MetricVoice Alerts - on/offBrightness - Auto/Minimum/Medium/Maximum/DarkBands Detected - Bands Detected - Any individual band(s), including laser can be disabled.Included with the Escort Passport 9500iQuick Release Windshield BracketCoiled SmartCord Power CordAluminum Travel CaseReference CardOwner's ManualEscort Passport 9500i SpecificationsDimensions: 1.4" H x 2.90" W x 5.35" LAdditional Information   Signals DetectedInstant-On (Pulse) Radar, K Band, Ka Band, Ku Band, Laser (front / rear), POP Mode Radar, Safety Warning System™ (SWS™) Alerts, X BandWarranty1 YearRDD ImmunityVG-2 UndetectableGPS FeaturesCurrent Speed Display, False Alert Lock Out, GPS Enabled, Mark LocationDisplay TypeTextFilteringAutomatic Filter Mode, Selectable BandsMounting StyleWindshieldPower OptionsNoAudio OptionsAudio Jack, Voice AlertsPorts and ConnectivityUSB PortFCC IDNoEditionNo Be the first to review this product Write Your Own Review   How do you rate this product? *   1 star2 stars3 stars4 stars5 starsRating   *Nickname    *Summary of Your Review    *Review      Submit Review Product Downloads Escort-Passport-9500i-Manual  (Size: 1.7 MB)  FREE SHIPPINGFree shipping on all orders over $99.

Passport Services

																								





Ever since the US Government passed new laws requiring passports for all travel out of the country, passport applications have been at an all-time high. This is especially true for those travelers visiting Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Receiving a passport through the US passport agency can take as long as 4-6 weeks to process - sometimes even longer. And making use of the government's "rush" service still
provides you no guarantee of getting your passport for weeks.
Passport expediting services exist to fill this gap. By paying a service fee (which varies, according to how fast you need your passport), you can receive your new or renewed passport in as little as 24 hours. This is an invaluable service for those people who have a vacation or trip planned in the near future, and therefore can't afford to take a chance that their passport will be delayed or that they won't receive
their passport in time for their trip.

Choosing a Passport Company
Passport demand has significantly increased over the last several years, creating a back log of requests and many angry travelers.  Requesting a passport through the US passport agency can take as long as four to six, or longer, to process. If you've decided to utilize a passport company to help with your passport needs be aware that these companies vary greatly in several aspects and finding a solid company,
that you can count on, for a fair price will save you time and money.
There are a variety of qualities you should compare when evaluating passport companies. Some of these include:

Turnaround Time. Some passport companies are able to expedite your passport and have it in your hands in 48 hours or less.  While others need at least 5 to 7 days to deliver a new passport.  When looking for a passport company identify what their specific turnaround times are and what each time frame costs.  You'll see a significant differences in charges across many companies.
Website Functionality. When you're searching for expert advice on what is needed for your passport renewal, what you can use in place of your missing birth certificate, how to obtain more passport pages, and more you'll want a company that offers a savvy website that is easy to use and loaded with information. Also, look for websites that provide online passport status information so
that
you may feel confident in the progress of your passport application.
Expert Advice. When you are looking for expert advice on what is needed for your passport renewal, or any other challenging questions - you'll want a company that offers plenty of information either on line or via the phone. Some companies provide everything you need to know while others are short on information and big on sales pitch.
Customer Service.  Getting your needs met, reducing your panic and answering all of your complicated passport questions is what you'll want in a company that needs to produce your passport fast.  Customer service levels between passport companies can vary greatly and you'll want to choose a company where the customer is always first. Look for companies that offer several methods of communication
and have extended hours to assist you - whenever needed.

When choosing a passport company, the internet provides the best resources for investigating and locating a quality passport company that you can feel confident with.  Consider using independent product review websites to quickly locate a strong passport company. They do a good job of quickly comparing and contrasting website functionality, prices, customer service and prior performance for you.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.

Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
