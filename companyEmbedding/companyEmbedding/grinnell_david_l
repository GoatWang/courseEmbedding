So sorry to hear. Great guy gone way to soon.




			
				
				Posted by: Andrew Esqueda - Baxter,  IA - acquaintance   Jul 20, 2017
			










Dave had so many great traits. Honesty, skill, work ethic,desire to help others, etc. I had the privilege of his friendship and patronage for many years.  My sympathies to all of his family members.




			
				
				Posted by: Richard Berman - Grinnell,  IA - Friend   Jun 22, 2017
			










I am still in shock by Dave's passing. He was not just my trusted mechanic but I feel as if I've lost a dear friend. The community will be lost without you, David. To Josh and John, my heartfelt and most sincere thoughts and prayers go out to you. I know you will both have many sad days ahead, especially Josh as you and your dad worked together every day. I'm sure you too, feel lost. I'm there for you, friend.

Prayer to cover the loss our family going through. May God guided our family into remembering the happy fun times you shared with Dave.Dave had worked for our family in his younger years with hay. May Dave rest in peace and peace be with your whole family.Peggy Hudnutt Guyer and MaryAnn Hudnutt

God asks for the best we have to offer him.     Not perfection, but the best.He just received the best the auto mechanics on earth could possibly give Him.




			
				
				Posted by: Dan Huebner   - Family Friend   Jun 21, 2017
			










I met David only once. I was visiting Grinnell over the Christmas-New Year's holidays about nine years ago and had a serious problem with my car. I asked, who is the best mechanic in town? The answer: David Good. But when I got my car to his shop, he said he was way too busy. But he recommended the second best mechanic, and that guy worked wonders. Thank you, David Good, for helping out a guy the best he could. Your passing is a real loss to the town, probably beyond your wizardry under the hood.

Dave will be missed greatly by everyone that knew him.  I am proud to have known him and called him my friend.  God bless you and our prayers are with your family.
