Reis is the most trusted source of crucial information on commercial real estate properties, transactions, markets, submarkets and performance. We maintain a proprietary database containing detailed information on commercial properties in metropolitan markets and neighborhoods throughout the U.S.
Our property data and market analytics are used by real estate investors, lenders and other professionals to make informed buying, selling and financing decisions. In addition, Reis data is used by debt and equity investors to assess, quantify and manage the risks of default and loss associated with individual mortgages, properties, portfolios and real estate backed securities. We currently provide information services to many of the nation's leading lending institutions, equity investors, brokers and appraisers.
Our products are designed to meet the demand for timely and accurate information to support the decision-making of property owners, developers, builders, banks and non-bank lenders, equity investors and service providers. These real estate professionals require access to timely information on both the performance and pricing of assets, including detailed data on market transactions, supply, absorption, rents and sale prices. This information is critical to all aspects of valuing assets and financing their acquisition, development and construction.
Whether they are buying, selling, leasing, financing, appraising or developing commercial properties, our clients count on us to provide the information they need to make better decisions – and generate more profits.

Methodology




















Our Research and Analytics
Reis Data Powers the Commercial Real Estate Industry
At every stage of the commercial real estate transaction lifecycle, and for every job function within the industry, Reis brings deal flow efficiency and transparency, guiding all parties to a common understanding of market conditions and, ultimately, property valuations.









The Reis Database
Underlying all of Reis’s analytical modules and reports is the nation’s most carefully developed, most diligently maintained commercial real estate database—a database in which properties are precisely categorized into subtypes most relevant to investors, plotted into logical submarkets, and rolled up to support clean, reliable trends and forecasts.
On an ongoing basis, Reis’s analysts survey property owners and managers to record key performance indicators, such as vacancy levels, rental rates, and concession package details. Reis's dynamic property-level updates allow refreshed data to flow through to rent comparables reports in real time. However, unlike other commercial real estate research services that tout their reliance upon online apartment listings services' advertisements as the basis for their "real time" data alterations, Reis subjects its real time updates to time-tested quality control procedures. In addition, to ensure full coverage of sales transactions and new construction projects, we scour public filings, such as tax assessor records, deed transfers, and numerous local, regional and national publications.
Quality Assurance
All findings are subjected to rigorous quality assurance and validation processes developed over many years. For example, if a survey at the property level reveals an unusual change in rent or vacancy since we last spoke to the owner or manager, follow-up procedures are performed to verify or correct results before publication. All aggregate market data at the submarket and market levels are also subjected to comprehensive quality controls.
A Trusted Source
Reis provides a curated view of the commercial real estate markets.  Our rigorous, uniformly applied research methodology, relentless product development, and top-notch customer service have made Reis the industry standard source, trusted by the nation's most respected financial institutions to provide accurate information on properties, submarkets, and metros.

As sales have dropped off, due to market saturation, they have thrown an incomprehensible amount of money trying to transform the sales process. This is routinely discussed on quarterly analyst calls, and the results haven't met expectations. Unfortunately, these efforts have been less than successful, and have created unintended consequences with a mass exodus of sales talent leaving the company, either by choice, or termination. Morale is at an all time low, with those staff remaining racing for the exits as quickly as possible, as the damage created is irreparable.Advice to ManagementSeek advice from your employees. So many decisions over the past two years were made without consulting those who they would effect most. It's so disappointing because you really did have an incredibly loyal and proud workforce. Restoring that sense of pride and loyalty should begin with an executive management self assessment, and honest apologies to staff for the environment toxicity. Honestly may be difficult, but it is respected over continual excuses and blame.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Reis Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Reis 2017-07-15 17:51 PDT Jun 16, 2017 Helpful (1)"Great place to work"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Team Leader in White Plains, NYCurrent Employee - Team Leader in White Plains, NYRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Reis (More than a year)ProsIf you work hard and show that you have a willingness to learn, you will get noticed and be compensated for it.
