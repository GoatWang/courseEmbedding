Business[edit]
While Crow Family Holdings has interests in numerous diversified investment activities, real estate is their foundation. Trammell Crow began a career of real estate development at the end of World War II. Since that time his family has had a prominent role as developers and investors in the U.S. and international real estate markets and has always embraced long-term partnerships.[2] Crow Family Holdings has been an active investor in industrial, office, retail, mart, land, hotel and residential real estate businesses in the United States, Europe and South America. Although real estate is its foundation, Crow Family Holdings has numerous and varied investment activities, including an investment portfolio with substantial stakes in privately held operating businesses and financial assets. Crow Family Holdings does not provide investment advisory services to any persons other than Crow family members and their affiliates.
Management team[edit]
The Crow Family Holdings includes Harlan Crow, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Anne Raymond, President of Crow Holdings Capital & Managing Director of Crow Holdings.[2] Kirk Rimer is the co-head of Crow Holdings Capital – Investment Partners.[3] Michael R. Silverman is the Principal, Chief Investment Officer at Crow Holdings Capital.[4]
Recent transactions[edit]
In February 2015, Crow Holdings launched a $3.5 million development of a new Maple Avenue restaurant district. [5]
In March 2015, Crow Holdings paid $140 million to buy the Dallas Market Center complex. They acquired sole ownership of the 5 million-square-foot wholesale center complex from Florida-based CNL Lifestyle Properties Inc. [6]
In May 2015, a fund of Crow Holdings Capital purchased a 27-building portfolio in Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston. Eight buildings are in the Dallas-Fort Worth. The 27 buildings total 2.3 million square feet and were 95.6% leased at the time of sale. [7]
In October 2015, Crow Holdings purchased the retail space in downtown Nashville’s Encore condo tower. They paid $11.5 million for the ground-floor retail space that is part of the 333 unit tower in SoBro. The Encore contains 19,500 square feet of street-level retail and restaurant space and is more than 90 percent leased. [8]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Crow Family Holidays has subsidiaries that include the Crow Investment Trust and it has major stakes in businesses which include Wyndham Hotels, Trammell Crow Residential and the Trammell Crow Company.[9] Other Crow Family organizations include the Trammell & Margaret Crow Collection of Asian Art. The Trammell Crow Company was purchased by outsiders in late 2006.
In the 2010 Pennsylvania election for the US Senate, the company was the largest corporate contributor to the Republican challenger Pat Toomey.[10]
