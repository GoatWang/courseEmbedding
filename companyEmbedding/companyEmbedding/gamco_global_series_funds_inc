1Forbes rates funds separately in both up and down market cycles. Funds are rated against their peers and are awarded letter grades (A+ to F) based on peformance in bull and bear markets. Market cycles are defined by an index or blend of indices. Stock funds, for example, are rated and benchmarked over four bullish and bearish cycles using the S&P 500 as a benchmark. The peformance benchmark for Balanced funds is a 50/50 blended index of the S&P 500 and the Merrill Lynch corporate/government bond index. Most bond funds are rated for five years, with each month treated as either a bullish or bearish month. Exception: taxable junk bond funds, which are presently rated over a 11-year period corresponding to the three most recent market cycles of the Merrill Lynch high yield bond index. 2Annual expense ratio plus brokerage commissions paid by the fund for buying and selling securities.  Cost Drag data provided by Lipper.  p: Prior year.

To sustain a private claim for securities fraud under Section 10(b) of the

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 1 Ob-5 promulgated thereunder, a plaintiff must prove

“(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection

behveen the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance

upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation”. GAMCO

Investors. Inc. v. Vivendi. S.A., — F. Supp. 2d —, 2013 WL 132583, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10,

2013) (“Summary Judgment Opinion” or “SJ Op.”) (citing Ashland Inc. v. Morgan Stanley &

Co.. Inc.. 652 F.3d 333, 337 (2d Cir. 2011) and Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton

Co., _U.S.

, 131 S.Ct. 2179, 2184 (2011)).

On August 10, 2012, the Court entered an Opinion and Order collaterally

estopping Defendant Vivendi, S.A. (“Vivendi”) from contesting, as to GAMCO Investors, Inc.

(“GAMCO”), the Section 10(b) elements of falsity, materiality, scienter, and loss causation. In

re Vivendi Universal. S.A. Sec. Litig., — F. Supp. 2d —, 2012 WL 3264382 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10,

2012). On January 29, 2013, the Court entered an Order estopping Vivendi from contesting the

same elements as to the Mutual Funds Plaintiffs.’ Order, GAMCO Investors, Inc. v. Vivendi,

S.A., 03 Civ. 5911 (SAS) (Jan. 29, 2013), ECF No. 118. The parties have stipulated as to the

amount of damages that would be awarded should Plaintiffs prevail at trial. Stipulation and

Order dated February 8, 2013, GAMCO Investors, Inc. v. Vivendi, S.A., 03 Civ. 5911 (SAS),

ECF No. —. In this action, the only remaining issue to be determined is whether defendant

1 The term “Mutual Funds Plaintiffs” refers to GAMCO Global Series Funds, Inc., Gabelli
Capital Asset Fund, The Gabelli Value Fund, Inc., The Gabelli Asset Fund, The Gabelli Global
Multimedia Trust, Inc. and The Gabelli Equity Trust, Inc. The GAMCO Mathers Fund, The
Gabelli Convertible and Income Securities Fund, Inc. and GAMCO International Growth Fund,
Inc. are no longer pursuing any damages in this action, and the claims of those funds will
therefore be dismissed.

1

Case 1:09-cv-07962-SAS Document 35 Filed 02/11/13 Page 5 of 16

Vivendi has successfully rebutted the presumption of reliance relied upon by Plaintiffs in this

case.

That remaining issue can be decided one of three ways, each one being sufficient

for Vivendi to prevail:

I. Did Plaintiffs purchase Vivendi ADRs without regard to whether their market

price was an accurate measure of their intrinsic value?

II. Would Plaintiffs have purchased Vivendi ADRs had they known Vivendi’s

alleged true liquidity condition?

III. If Plaintiffs relied on the efficiency of the market, was such reliance

reasonable under the circumstances here?

I.

Did Plaintiffs purchase Vivendi ADRs without regard to whether their market price
was an accurate measure of their intrinsic value?

A.

Applicable Law

To prove reliance, the plaintiff must show that but for the material misleading

statement or omission, it would not have transacted in the security.

Id. This is sometimes

referred to as “transaction causation”. Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341

(2005). In Basic v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 247 (1988) (“Basic”), the Supreme Court held that,

under certain circumstances, a plaintiff is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that it relied on the

efficiency of the market. The presumption means that investors rely on the market price of a

security as an accurate measure of its intrinsic value.

sj op., 2013 WL 132583 at *4 (citing
Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Bombardier Inc., 546 F.3d 196, 200 n.4 (2d

Cir. 2008) (“Teamsters”). Plaintiffs plead such reliance in this case.2 This presumption of

591 l(SAS) (July 15, 2009), ECF No. 70; Mutual Funds Plaintiffs’ Complaint ¶ 223, GAMCO
Global Series Funds. Inc. v. Vivendi, S.A., 09 Civ. 7962(SAS) (Sept. 16, 2009), ECF No. 1.

2

Case 1:09-cv-07962-SAS Document 35 Filed 02/11/13 Page 6 of 16

reliance can be rebutted by any showing that “severs the link between the alleged

misrepresentation and either the price received (or paid) by the plaintiff, or [plaintiff’s] decision

to trade at a fair market price”.

Id. at 248-49. Specifically, the defendant can rebut the

presumption of reliance by showing either that “the alleged misrepresentation did not impact the

market price” or that “the investor did not ‘rely on the market price of [the] securit[y] as an
accurate measure of [its] intrinsic value”. s op., 2013 WL 132583 at *4 (citing Teamsters, 546
F.3d at 200 n.4).

It is not enough for a plaintiff to have merely considered the market price of the

security in question in their purchase decisions3. Since every investor presumably pays “the

market price”, every investor who purchased a security on the open market, under such theory,

would always be regarded as having relied upon the integrity of market price in making the

purchase, because at some point she would have had to “consider” the market price when she

made the purchase at the market price. But that is not what the presumption means. See SJ Op.,

2013 WL 132583 at *10 (The cases cited by GAMCO “do not imply that, absent insider

information, the fraud on the market presumption is irrebuttable as against any investor who

purchased a security at market value”). To be entitled to the presumption of reliance on the

efficiency of the market price, the plaintiff has to have relied on the market price as “an accurate

measure of [the security’s] intrinsic value”. SJ Op., 2013 WL 132583 at *4 (citing Teamsters,

546 F.3d 196 at 200 n.4).

B.

Summary of Facts

During the Relevant Period, GAMCO was a wholly owned subsidiary of Gabelli

Asset Management, Inc. (“GBL”) and an investment advisor that “provide[s] investment advice

GAMCO’s Summary Judgment Reply Memorandum, GAMCO Investors, Inc. v. Vivendi,
S.A., 03 Civ. 591 1(SAS) (Dec. 12, 2012), ECF No. 112 (“GAMCO Reply Br.”).

Case 1:09-cv-07962-SAS Document 35 Filed 02/11/13 Page 7 of 16

to a broad array of clients”. (Undisputed, see Joint Pre-Trial Order ¶ 5, Undisputed Facts

(“JPTO”).) GAMCO was an advisor to the Mutual Funds Plaintiffs. (Alpert Dep. 18:20-23.)

GBL’s Chairman and CEO was Mario Gabelli. (Undisputed, see JPTO.) Gabelli & Company

was the research arm of GBL and performs research for GAMCO and other parts of the GBL

organization including the Mutual Funds Plaintiffs. (Jamieson Dep. 33:4-10.) GBL held daily

morning meetings during which Gabelli & Company securities analysts presented to portfolio

managers the results of their research on the companies they covered. (Woodson Dep. 3 8:6-

39:7.) Vivendi was the subject of some of these meetings. (Rittenberry Dep. 30:15-17.)

Plaintiffs’ portfolio managers made the decisions about what stocks to buy and sell based on

research provided by Gabelli & Company analysts. (Woodson Dep. 25:12-23, 3 8:6-20.)

In making their purchase decisions, Plaintiffs did not rely on the market price as

an “accurate measure of [securities’) intrinsic value”. Rather, they used a company’s Private

Market Value (“PMV”), which is the value an informed industrialist would pay to own the assets

of the company in a private transaction. (Woodson Dep. 141:5-9; Gabelli Dep. 31:3-13.)

Plaintiffs’ analysts calculated PMVs using a template created by Mario Gabelli, in which the

analyst breaks down a company into business segments and values each segment based on what

the analyst thinks a reasonable buyer would pay for that segment as a separate entity in the

private market. (Rittenberry Dep. 53 :22-54:12, 55:17-25.) The market price of a security is

a factor in Plaintiffs’ calculation of a company’s PMV. (Rittenberry, 57:10-18; Alpert Dep.

100:6-8.) Plaintiffs consider that a company’s PMV, not the market price, represents the “real

true intrinsic value” of the company’s securities. (Woodson Dep. 125:24-126:1; Alpert Dep.

72:6-9.) In fact, Plaintiffs in their publications and testimony refer to the stock market as “Mr.

Market”, who was described as “irrational[]”, “emotional” and subject to “euphoria and

4

Case 1:09-cv-07962-SAS Document 35 Filed 02/11/13 Page 8 of 16

depression”. (Exs. D, F, N; Woodson Dep. 125:16-126:4). Plaintiffs’ core investment

philosophy is to purchase securities whose market prices are at substantial discounts to their

intrinsic PMVs if there is also a “catalyst” that might cause the market prices to rise to the PMVs

in the future, typically a period of between two and five years. (Exs. J, G, BD, BE; Rittenberry

Dep. 108:3-7; Alpert Dep. 71:17-22.) The bigger the difference between market price of a

security and its intrinsic value (i.e., PMV), the more likely Plaintiffs would purchase the security.

(Rittenberry Dep. 257:21-24.) In addition to GAMCO, all the Mutual Funds Plaintiffs that

purchased Vivendi ADRs were value-oriented funds that used the PMV methodology in making

investment decisions. (Alpert Dep. 67:7-69:8; Exs. E, AQ, AR.)

Plaintiffs specifically relied on the PMV methodology in purchasing Vivendi

ADRs. Plaintiffs calculated Vivendi’s PMV, (Rittenberry Dep. 34:2-5, 48:24-49:21; see, e.g., Ex.

S), and concluded that Vivendi was trading below its PMV, (Rittenberry Dep. 36:16-37:7;

Jamieson 334:6-335:9; Woodson Dep. 123:5-126:4). In fact, Plaintiffs repeatedly used Vivendi

in presentations to shareholders and actual and prospective customers as an illustration of a

company whose securities were trading at substantial discounts to their PMVs. (Exs. 0, N, T.)

The evidence clearly shows that during the period October 30, 2000, through

August 14, 2002 (the “Relevant Period”), Plaintiffs relied on the PMV methodology and only on

that methodology in making purchase decisions with respect to Vivendi ADRs, and did not rely

on Vivendi ADRs’ market price as “an accurate measure of their intrinsic value”.

II.

Would Plaintiffs have purchased Vivendi ADRs had they known Vivendi’s alleged
true liquidity condition?

A.

Applicable Law

To establish reliance, Plaintiffs must show that but for the materially misleading

statement or omission, they “would not have transacted in the security”. SJ Op., 2013 WL
132583 at *3; Dura Pharmaceuticals, 544 U.S. at 341.

Plaintiffs’ argument that Vivendi must show that the Plaintiffs would have

purchased Vivendi ADRs at the same price had it known of the fraud, (GAMCO Reply Br. at 8-

9), is misplaced. Plaintiffs cited only one decision in this Circuit for such requirement.

(GAMCO’s Reply Memorandum of Law at 9 (citing Lawrence v. Philip Morris Cos., Inc., No.

94 Civ. 1494, 1999 WL 51845, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 1997)). But Kline v. Wolf, 702 F.2d 400

(2d Cir. 1983), the Second Circuit decision cited by Lawrence for support, in fact held that the

defendant need only show that “even if [plaintiff] had known of the alleged misrepresentation, [it]

would still have purchased the stock”. Kline, 702 F.2d at 403; see also Dura Pharmaceuticals,

544 U.S. at 341 (the fraud on the market presumption “nonconclusively presum[es] that that

plaintiffs have relied upon [the] misrepresentation as long as they would not have bought the

share in its absence). Price is not mentioned in either of these cases.

Plaintiffs’ post-disclosure purchases of the security in question are relevant in

evaluating whether they would have purchased the security had they known about the fraud. See

In re Safeguard Scientifics, 216 F.R.D. 577, 582 (E.D. Pa. 2003). The cases cited by GAMCO

concerning post-disclosure purchases (GAMCO’s Reply Br. at 10-12) only “hold that post

disclosure purchases of securities do not necessarily rebut the fraud on the market presumption

as a matter of law”. SJ Op., 2013 WL 132583 at *10 (emphasis in the original). As this Court

6

Case 1:09-cv-07962-SAS Document 35 Filed 02/11/13 Page 10 of 16

noted, they “do not imply that post-disclosure purchases are never relevant to the plaintiffs

reliance”.

Id.

B.

Summary of Facts

In the Class Action, relied upon by Plaintiffs here for collateral estoppel purposes,

Vivendi was found to have “misstated or omitted its true liquidity risk”. (Class Trial Verdict

Form, Table A.) However, Vivendi’ s liquidity condition or its liquidity risk were not part of and

did not affect Plaintiffs’ decisions to purchase Vivendi ADRs. Plaintiffs purchased Vivendi

ADRs during the Relevant Period because they believed that they were trading below the

company’s “real true intrinsic value”, the PMV. (Jamieson 334:6-335:9, Rittenberry Dep. 36:16-

37:7; Woodson Dep. 123:5-126:4.) Andrew Rittenberry, Plaintiffs’ analyst responsible for

calculating Vivendi’s PMV and offering investment recommendations about Vivendi, believed

that Vivendi had a “liquidity crisis” “[i]n the spring of 2002” but it did not affect his investment

recommendation on Vivendi. (Rittenberry Dep. 126:11-17, 133:6-10.) In fact, he believed that

“in terms of what the asset value of the company is, [Vivendi’s supposed liquidity crisis] doesn’t

affect it in any way whatsoever”. (Rittenberry Dep. 133:11-17.) As explained by Rittenberry,

Mario Gabelli is a “very long-term investor” who would not be concerned with “noise” such as a

company’s liquidity condition. (Rittenberry Dep. 157-14-15, 158:12-23.)

Further, according to Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Blame Nye, in testimony considered

by the class action jury, Vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition began to be revealed on

January 7, 2002, and continued to be revealed through August 14, 2002 (undisputed, see JPTO),

yet Mario Gabelli still believed that Vivendi was undervalued by June 3, 2002, and noted that

“[his] view of [Vivendi’s] assets ha[d] not changed” by July 1, 2002 (Ex. AJ; Gabelli Dep.

169:19-170:7.) In fact, Rittenberry never gave a “sell” recommendation on Vivendi securities

during the Relevant Period, even when Vivendi’s allegedly misstated or omitted liquidity risk

7

Case 1:09-cv-07962-SAS Document 35 Filed 02/11/13 Page 11 of 16

was being revealed to the market. (Rittenberry Dep. 34:14-25, 36:16-37:7.) The evidence

clearly shows that Plaintiffs would have purchased Vivendi ADRs had they known of Vivendi’s

alleged true liquidity condition. In fact, even if the law requires a defendant to show that the

plaintiff would have purchased the securities at the same price in order to rebut the presumption

of reliance, Vivendi would be able to carry that burden: Because Vivendi’s liquidity condition—

the very information alleged to have been misstated or omitted—did not affect and would not

have affected Plaintiffs’ private market valuation of Vivendi, Plaintiffs would still have

purchased Vivendi ADRs at the same price.

That point is further supported by the fact that Plaintiffs actually increased their

investments in Vivendi ADRs after Vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition began to be

revealed. ($ee JPTO; Exs. AV, AW, AX, AY.) In fact, Plaintiffs made their largest one-day

purchase of Vivendi ADRs on July 2, 2002, which according to Dr. Nye, was one of the days on

which Vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition was being revealed to the market. (Exs. AV,

AW, AX, AY.) This further confirms not only that Vivendi’s liquidity condition did not affect

Plaintiffs’ private market valuation of Vivendi ADRs, but that they would have purchased, and

did purchase, Vivendi ADRs at market price even after they knew of Vivendi’s alleged true

liquidity condition.

III.

If Plaintiffs relied on the efficiency of the market, was such reliance reasonable
under the circumstances here?

A.

Applicable Law

In addition to taking advantage of the presumption of reliance, the plaintiff must

also show that its reliance was reasonable. s op., 2013 WL 132583 at *3 (citing Starr ex rd.

Estate of Sampson v. Georgeson Shareholder, Inc., 412 F.3d 103, 109-10 (2d Cir. 2005). “An

investor may not justifiably rely on a misrepresentation if, through minimal diligence, the

investor should have discovered the truth.” Id. at *3 (quoting Brown v. E.F. Hutton Group, Inc.,

991 F.2d 1020, 1031-32 (2d Cir. 1993) (“Brown”)). The Second Circuit considers the following

list of relevant factors in evaluating whether a plaintiffs reliance is reasonable:

(1) The sophistication and expertise of the plaintiff in financial and
securities matters; (2) the existence of longstanding business or
personal relationship; (3) access to the relevant information; (4) the
existence of a fiduciary relationship; (5) concealment of the fraud;
(6) the opportunity to detect the fraud; (7) whether the plaintiff
initiated the stock transaction or sought to expedite the transaction;
and (8) the generality or specificity of the misrepresentations.
Ici at *4 (quoting Brown, 991 F.2d at 103 1-32).

B.

Summary of Facts4

GAMCO is a sophisticated investor with strong industry knowledge and research

capabilities. As an investor advisor, GAMCO employed between 150 and 200 people during the

Relevant Period to research and manage its securities on behalf of its clients. (Jamieson Dep.

15:11-18, 39:20-40:2.) Mario Gabelli is a sophisticated investor, and is particularly

knowledgeable about various industries including cable broadcasting. (Gabelli Dep. 11:6-8,

11:12-12:3.) Rittenberry, the GBL analyst who tracks Vivendi and other major companies in the

Vivendi does not have any evidence—and therefore will not contend—that Plaintiffs in fact

possessed non-public corrective infonnation about Vivendi’s alleged misstatements.

9

Case 1:09-cv-07962-SAS Document 35 Filed 02/11/13 Page 13 of 16

media industry, described his responsibility as to “be an expert in [the media] industry; what’s

going on in the industry, what’s going on at all the companies, what the dynamics are within the

industry” and to “report those and discuss those with.. . clients of the broker/dealer and the

principal client who is GAMCO”. (Rittenberry Dep. 24:18-25:4.) His goal of being an expert in

the media industry was to “understand the industry better than the average investor on Wall

Street” and to “understand the dynamics in the industry and the company better than the average

investor”. (Rittenberry Dep. 25:12-18.)

Furthermore, Plaintiffs had private communications with Vivendi, including

Vivendi’s CEO, Jean-Marie Messier, and CFO, Guillaume Hannezo, during the Relevant Period.

In February 2001, Mario Gabelli and Marc Gabelli had a meeting with Messier. (Undisputed,

see JPTO.) Marc Gabelli wrote to Messier afterwards that “the meeting served well in

crystallizing [Messier’s] strategy”. (Ex. I.) Mario Gabelli wrote to Messier afterwards that

Messier “shared with us the silhouette of the long-term issues that Vivendi faces”.

(Ex. Y.)

Mario Gabelli and Marc Gabelli also met Messier at the Allen & Company Conference in Sun

Valley in 2001.

(Ex. R.) On April 30, 2002, Mario Gabelli, Marc Gabelli and Rittenberry had a

private meeting with Messier and Hannezo.

(Exs. AG, AH.) Mario Gabelli wrote to Messier

afterwards that “Andy Rittenberry, Marc Gabelli and I have many questions about Vivendi’s

strategy in an ever-changing world and are delighted that the door is open to us to ask about it”.

(Ex. AH.) Lastly, Rittenberry listened to Vivendi conference calls, attended Vivendi’ s investor

conferences and communicated with Vivendi’ s investor relations personnel Eileen McLaughlin

and Laura Martin over the phone and via emails during the Relevant Period. (Rittenberry Dep.

23:8-23; 192:19-194:4.) During his communications with McLaughlin and Martin, Rittenberry

asked questions such as “why was [Vivendi’s] EBITDA up X percent last quarter” and “you said

10

Case 1:09-cv-07962-SAS Document 35 Filed 02/11/13 Page 14 of 16

on the conference call about your guidance, why — what is your guidance again”, and had them

“walk [him] through some of the things on [Vivendi’s] balance sheet and tell [him] why certain

things are moving up and down and why this jump versus that jump”. (Rittenberry Dep. 195:15-

25.)

As a result, Plaintiffs had extensive knowledge about Vivendi. For example,

Rittenberry was able to “d[i]g out” Vivendi’s debt numbers from its filings when he initially

“couldn’t get the numbers to add up”. (Exs. AC; Rittenberry Dep. 198:15-24.) He later

explained to Eileen McLaughlin, “I do not think anyone was misled in any way. Anyone who

knows that their [sic] is a difference in the US and French GAAP should have dug into the filings,

talked to you guys for 5 minutes and figured out the answers”. (Ex. AD.) Similarly, before

February 1, 2002, Rittenberry already knew that Vivendi did not have access to the entire cash

flow of certain of its subsidiaries. (Rittenberry Dep. 265:4-6.) He commented on his “Vivendi

Model”: “[T]hese jokers only have minority positions in some units yet they consolidate all of it

and act like they have access to the cash flow, which of course they don’t. They only have

voting control.” (Ex. AB.)

Even though there is no evidence that Plaintiffs in fact possessed non-public

corrective information about Vivendi’ s misstatements, Plaintiffs, as sophisticated investors who

had extensive knowledge of Vivendi and private communications with Vivendi’s management,

could have discovered Vivendi’s alleged true liquidity condition through minimal due diligence,

assuming that it would have made any difference to their purchase decisions. It would have been

easy for Mario Gabelli and Andrew Rittenberry to have explored that issue with Vivendi’s CEO

and CFO in one of their private meetings, but there is no evidence that they even raised the

subject. Plaintiffs’ failure to utilize GAMCO’s sophistication, resources and access to Vivendi

11

Case 1:09-cv-07962-SAS Document 35 Filed 02/11/13 Page 15 of 16

to discover Vivendi’ s alleged true liquidity condition, through minimal due diligence, renders

their purported reliance on Vivendi’ s alleged misstatements by virtue of the presumption of

reliance on the efficiency of the market unreasonable.

IV.

Conclusion

For the above reasons, Vivendi has successfully rebutted the presumption of

reliance. The reliance element of Plaintiffs’ claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities

Exchange Act and Rule 1 Ob-5 is not established, and consequently, Plaintiffs’ claims must fail.

Date Filed:
 9/16/2009

 Securities

Details About Securities Cases Generally
 
This matter above may or may not include any or all of the types of Securities claims described below. The description below is intended to provide information about Securities cases generally rather than information specific to this case :
  
 The Laws That Govern the Securities Industry




 Securities Act of   1933
 Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 Trust Indenture Act of   1939
 Investment Company Act of 1940
 Investment Advisers Act of   1940
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002




Securities Act of 1933
Often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, the Securities Act of   1933 has two basic objectives: 

  
require that investors receive financial and other significant information   concerning securities being offered for public sale; and 
prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale of   securities. 

The full text of this Act is available at: http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C2A.txt.   (Please check the Classification   Tables maintained by the US House of Representatives   Office of the Law Revision Counsel for updates to any of the laws.) 
Purpose of Registration
A primary means of accomplishing these goals is the disclosure of important   financial information through the registration of securities. This information   enables investors, not the government, to make informed judgments about whether   to purchase a company's securities. While the SEC requires that the information   provided be accurate, it does not guarantee it. Investors who purchase   securities and suffer losses have important recovery rights if they can prove   that there was incomplete or inaccurate disclosure of important information. 
The Registration Process
In general, securities sold in the U.S. must be registered. The registration   forms companies file provide essential facts while minimizing the burden and   expense of complying with the law. In general, registration forms call for:

  
a description of the company's properties and business; 
a description of the security to be offered for sale; 
information about the management of the company; and 
financial statements certified by independent accountants. 

Registration statements and prospectuses become public shortly after filing   with the SEC. If filed by U.S. domestic companies, the statements are available   on the EDGAR database accessible at   www.sec.gov. Registration statements are subject to examination for compliance   with disclosure requirements.
Not all offerings of securities must be registered with the Commission. Some   exemptions from the registration requirement include:

  
private offerings to a limited number of persons or institutions; 
offerings of limited size; 
intrastate offerings; and 
securities of municipal, state, and federal governments. 

By exempting many small offerings from the registration process, the SEC   seeks to foster capital formation by lowering the cost of offering securities to   the public. 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934
With this Act, Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission. The   Act empowers the SEC with broad authority over all aspects of the securities   industry. This includes the power to register, regulate, and oversee brokerage   firms, transfer agents, and clearing agencies as well as the nation's securities   self regulatory organizations (SROs). The various stock exchanges, such as the   New York Stock Exchange, and American Stock Exchange are SROs. The National   Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the NASDAQ system, is also an   SRO.
The Act also identifies and prohibits certain types of conduct in the markets   and provides the Commission with disciplinary powers over regulated entities and   persons associated with them.
The Act also empowers the SEC to require periodic reporting of information by   companies with publicly traded securities. 
Corporate Reporting
Companies with more than $10 million in assets whose securities are held by   more than 500 owners must file annual and other periodic reports. These reports   are available to the public through the SEC's EDGAR database. 
Proxy Solicitations
The Securities Exchange Act also governs the disclosure in materials used to   solicit shareholders' votes in annual or special meetings held for the election   of directors and the approval of other corporate action. This information,   contained in proxy materials, must be filed with the Commission in advance of   any solicitation to ensure compliance with the disclosure rules. Solicitations,   whether by management or shareholder groups, must disclose all important facts   concerning the issues on which holders are asked to vote. 
Tender Offers
The Securities Exchange Act requires disclosure of important information by   anyone seeking to acquire more than 5 percent of a company's securities by   direct purchase or tender offer. Such an offer often is extended in an effort to   gain control of the company. As with the proxy rules, this allows shareholders   to make informed decisions on these critical corporate events. 
Insider Trading
The securities laws broadly prohibit fraudulent activities of any kind in   connection with the offer, purchase, or sale of securities. These provisions are   the basis for many types of disciplinary actions, including actions against   fraudulent insider trading. Insider trading is illegal when a person trades a   security while in possession of material nonpublic information in violation of a   duty to withhold the information or refrain from trading. 
Registration of Exchanges, Associations, and Others
The Act requires a variety of market participants to register with the   Commission, including exchanges, brokers and dealers, transfer agents, and   clearing agencies. Registration for these organizations involves filing   disclosure documents that are updated on a regular basis. 
The exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) are   identified as self-regulatory organizations (SRO). SROs must create rules that   allow for disciplining members for improper conduct and for establishing   measures to ensure market integrity and investor protection. SRO proposed rules   are published for comment before final SEC review and approval. 
The full text of this Act can be read at: http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C2B.txt.   (Please check the Classification   Tables maintained by the US House of Representatives   Office of the Law Revision Counsel for updates to any of the laws.) 
Trust Indenture Act of 1939
This Act applies to debt securities such as bonds, debentures, and notes that   are offered for public sale. Even though such securities may be registered under   the Securities Act, they may not be offered for sale to the public unless a   formal agreement between the issuer of bonds and the bondholder, known as the   trust indenture, conforms to the standards of this Act.  The full text of this   Act is available at:  http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C2A.txt (Subchapter III).  (Please check the Classification   Tables maintained by the US House of Representatives   Office of the Law Revision Counsel for updates to any of the laws.) 
Investment Company Act of 1940
This Act regulates the organization of companies, including mutual funds,   that engage primarily in investing, reinvesting, and trading in securities, and   whose own securities are offered to the investing public. The regulation is   designed to minimize conflicts of interest that arise in these complex   operations. The Act requires these companies to disclose their financial   condition and investment policies to investors when stock is initially sold and,   subsequently, on a regular basis. The focus of this Act is on disclosure to the   investing public of information about the fund and its investment objectives, as   well as on investment company structure and operations. It is important to   remember that the Act does not permit the SEC to directly supervise the   investment decisions or activities of these companies or judge the merits of   their investments. The full text of this Act is available at: http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C2D.txt (Subchapter I). (Please check the Classification   Tables maintained by the US House of Representatives   Office of the Law Revision Counsel for updates to any of the laws.)
Investment Advisers Act of 1940
This law regulates investment advisers. With certain exceptions, this Act   requires that firms or sole practitioners compensated for advising others about   securities investments must register with the SEC and conform to regulations   designed to protect investors. Since the Act was amended in 1996, generally only   advisers who have at least $25 million of assets under management or advise a   registered investment company must register with the Commission.  The full text   of this Act is available at: http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C2D.txt (Subchapter II). (Please check the Classification   Tables maintained by the US House of Representatives   Office of the Law Revision Counsel for updates to any of the laws.)
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of   2002, which he characterized as "the most far reaching reforms of American   business practices since the time of Franklin Delano Roosevelt." The Act   mandated a number of reforms to enhance corporate responsibility, enhance   financial disclosures and combat corporate and accounting fraud, and created the   "Public Company Accounting Oversight Board," also known as the PCAOB, to oversee   the activities of the auditing profession. The full text of the Act is available   at:  http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/15C98.txt.   (Please check the Classification   Tables maintained by the US House of Representatives   Office of the Law Revision Counsel for updates to any of the laws.)  You can   find links to all Commission rulemaking and reports issued under the   Sarbanes-Oxley Act at:  http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/sarbanes-oxley.htm.

How They Won It: Cravath Thwarts $3.5M Vivendi Investor Suit
Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP successfully rebutted the so-called fraud-on-the-market presumption in defeating a $3.5 million investor suit accusing Vivendi SA of alleged misstatements and stock price inflation, using rigorous direct examination of the plaintiffs' witnesses and an unconventionally academic closing argument.
