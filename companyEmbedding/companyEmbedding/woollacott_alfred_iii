My four legged stool, the strength of 



my soul and upon it I shall rest.
Welcome - We all have unique four legged stools, each leg an extension from our grandparents who contribute to our being. At conception, our entire biology stems from our forebears, the history that preceded us. Our environment, first from within the womb then from without, people and events, often beyond our control, shape us further. If history does repeat, did our forebears experience what we now are experiencing? And if so, will we react as they once did? And if our biological bonds forget, will random energy pulses trigger a memory cord? 









As of December 1, 2014 "The Immigrant" is available for sale by clicking the envelop icon in the upper right, or by mailing to Myfourleggedstool Publishers P.O. Box 2911 Oak Bluffs, MA 02557, or by visiting Amazon.com
 






 



On this site are several register formatted, diligently footnoted papers on my or my wife, Jill's, four legged stools. My paternal grandparents' surnames are WOOLLACOTT and WILLIAMS and my maternal ones are NAULT and YOUNG; Jill's are CHANDLER and HART, GERMOND and CHAMBERLAIN, respectively.While I lack any drop of blood in my veins from those last four surnames, our children do and those four form two of their legs. So yes, in a general sense, we are both 3/4 English and 1/4 French, with our French coming from our mothers' fathers. Links to our seven generation fan charts are below to give you other surnames in our genealogy. Here is my fan chart  /uploads/1/9/2/5/19256439/ancestor_fan_of_alfred_woollacott.jpgAnd here is Jill's /uploads/1/9/2/5/19256439/ancestor_fan_of_jill_chandler.jpgThe charts, like the genealogical journey they reflect, have holes and are always being refined. Some ancestors, who preceded the seven generations shown, are known, but not presented. Others, who are shown, lack basic information, reflecting the varying comfort levels of my research thus far.  If their published genealogy is under the sections Alfred's Four Legged Stool or Jill's Four Legged Stool, then my comfort is extremely high. But for others, further research may be needed before I reach a near certain comfort. Thus, I am loathe to put my over 4,000 names on my Legacy file onto the internet since I could be  perpetuating misinformation. So if some surnames pique an interest, send me an e-mail and we can discuss them further. Some of my grandchildren are members of the Wampanoag tribe of Aquinnah, Gay Head. Their heritage, which is on my Legacy file, contain surnames of BAIRD, COOK, MADISON and VANDERHOOP, among others. So if your interest is with the tribe, I can tell you what I have. But perhaps better, I can direct you to people who are more knowledgeable than I on tribal ancestry.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Immigrant:One From My Four Legged Stool, published December 2014Much of my working life was spent gathering facts to support assertions, useful for my new found passion of genealogical research. But data transcription can grow tedious, while snippets of an ancestor’s life grow fascinating, and  relating them to an era, simply captivating. So with some imagination, anchored in fact and tempered with plausibility, ancestors can achieve more robust lives as envisioned by a writer with a few drops of their blood in his veins. All our ancestors lived when momentous events occurred. Some experienced them up close and personal. Ever wonder what they might have been thinking? Under the Timelines section are my thoughts as seen through my ancestors' eyes.Three situations have intrigued me such that my wonderment has driven me to create historical narratives. My first historical narrative, "The Immigrant",  which is about my seven-greats grandfather John Law, was completed in 2014. There is a tab devoted exclusively to "The Immigrant", including a 45 minute interview on my journey to publishing this debut novel. John Law's register formatted, diligently footnoted genealogy is under the section Alfred's Four Legged Stool. So if like Joe Friday you desire "just the facts, ma'am, just the facts", then read John Law of Acton, Massachusetts, Reuben Law of Acton, Massachusetts and Sharon, New Hampshire, which was published in 2011. But if you ever wondered about the Battle of Dunbar, the horrors of Durham Cathedral that ensued Dunbar or the life of a Scottish immigrant in a Puritan theocracy, then read my book. It is available in paperback and as an e-book through Amazon among other locations. Or simply click the 'envelop' in the top right, and I will mail you a signed copy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Reuben Law, John's great grandson, was at "The Bridge" with the Acton Militia on 19 April 1775, then at Bunker Hill two months later. Timelines contains a snippet of his thoughts on April 19th. Reuben's daughter Susanna, her husband, two of their children and Reuben's granddaughter, Naamah, like so many from the Peterborough, New Hampshire area in the 1840s were inspired by Joseph Smith teachings and traveled to Nauvoo, Illinois. Naamah, who arrived at Nauvoo after Joseph Smith's assassination, suffered great personal losses while witnessing Nauvoo's terror before being sealed to Brigham Young, just prior to his journey west. Timelines contain a scene at Nauvoo on 30 June 1844. The three generations of Reuben are under My Four Legged Stool in Reuben Law of Acton, Massachusetts and Sharon, New Hampshire. Novels about Reuben and about the Peterborough Saints, "The Patriot" and "the Believers", respectively, are in process.

The ImmigrantOne from My Four Legged StoolAlfred Woollacott, IIIJohn Law is the author’s seven-greats grandfather who comes to colonial America in chains as a Scottish Prisoner of War of The Battle of Dunbar. Upon landing in Boston in the winter of 1651, Law serves his remaining indenture in the community of Concord as a public shepherd. Although Concord will become his “New Scotland", Law must negotiate some challenging hurdles to make that happen —Puritan theocracy, English bigotry, and Native American dangers, among others. Throughout all of Law’s ordeals, he wonders if God ever hears him. One day God does. The Immigrant is more than a meticulously researched novel. There are many meaningful layers to savor and several historical puzzles to uncover."The Immigrant is a terrific read because it succeeds on its literary merit: well-plotted, with substantive characters. Redolent with details of life on the frontier of the New World,  John Law’s travails put the reader in his hardscrabble life, contending with bigotry, penury, and the unforgiving New England climate in the days before diversity, electric blankets, and supermarkets." - Jack Shea, MVTimes  “Woollacott writes with color, creating scenes with drama and pathos. He also has an uncanny ability to get into the heads of his characters. The Immigrant is a book you won’t want to miss.”  – Rick Herrick, The Vineyard Gazette, author of A Man Called Jesus A Novel and The Case Against Evangelical Christianity"Alfred Woollacott, III is a fascinating man obsessed with history - in the right kind of way. Writing of this quality is immensely rewarding for the reader. Not only does the author treat us to history - he also entertains us with a multifaceted tale that has a new level of pertinence as the chapters unfold. Highly recommended." - Grady Harp, An Amazon Top 100, Hall of Fame and Vine Voice Reviewer"A gripping tale about the endurance and fortitude of an unlikely colonist." – Kirkus ReviewsThis is an historical novel, which is fascinating, educational and dramatic. The author did a great deal of research covering these historical times and then encompassed it in a great novel of John Law, a fifteen year old Scot who had been grabbed by Scottish military to fight as a pikeman against the British forces of Cromwell. - Joan A.

Alfred Woollacott, III

My genealogical journey began while chauffeuring Jill, her mother and two of their octogenarian cousins around England in 1999. As I lay awake, I said to Jill, "Once I retire, I'm going to work on my family tree." She yawned while saying, "Boy, all these castles, churches and cemeteries have really gotten to you." She slammed her head back down on the pillow for a bit more rest.  In 2002, I retired from KPMG, a firm where I had spent my entire career spanning some 34 years. When a fellow partner asked, "Al, you're too young to retire, what are you going to do now?" I responded, "What I have always done, except I won't be going to work." Filling in the '50 to 60 hour per week void' that retirement created was easy. Believe me, retirement is highly underrated. I honored the vow I made while in England and dabbled with my family history until a post on a genealogy website from a Charles HB Cole looking for information on the Fitchburg Woollacotts captured me. Charles's work was extensive; I was even in it. In no time, the Woollacott leg of my stool was far extended. I was hooked on family history and needed more. When my brother and I traveled to Devon in 2007, we had a lovely lunch with Charles and his family. After lunch, Charles calculated that we were 6th cousins. Like a dutiful auditor, I checked his calculations - he was correct. I told him about the love/hate relationship with genealogy that he had created within me. He laughed, and I sensed he knew what I was experiencing. When his wife added that while on their honeymoon Charles was in the library doing genealogy, I was certain that Charles knew.My maternal grandmother attended DAR meetings in Peterborough. So I contacted their New Hampshire Chapter and gave them the name of Grace Belle (Young) Nault born 3 July 1881. Within a week, I knew my patriot, a Private Reuben Law. My initial fleeting thought -  just a private, I guess it's no Order of Cincinnati for me. But as I researched him further, I found a Private Reuben Law in the Acton Militia who was at the Concord Bridge on April 19th. That had to be him, how many Reuben Laws could there be?  And then I wondered, what was going through the mind of a 23 year old on that morning. That thought was not fleeting, but haunting.My adult life was spent crunching numbers and verifying assertions. So researching dates and concluding on supporting evidence comes easy to me. I received a B. S. in Business Administration ('68) and later an MBA ('71), both from Boston University. English literature, composition and creative writing were not in my college education. And at KPMG, creative writing was strictly forbidden - just the facts and then a conclusion. So transporting my wonder about an ancestor out of my head and onto paper does not come easy. But thanks to local writers like John Hough, Jr. and Cynthia Riggs, who teach Adult Continuing Education ("ACE") on the Vineyard, Grub Street workshops and others, I am learning. But it's never easy.  I do the Friday and Saturday Wall Street Journal crossword puzzles. It is a rare day when I can complete a puzzle in one sitting. But after several iterations, I eventually achieve success. Creative writing is similar; a paragraph or scene is rarely right with just one pass. But unlike crossword puzzles, you 're never sure if you have ever gotten it completely right.So now my family history dabbling has become an obsession with dates and places stuck to my head like tossed Velcro balls hanging from a fuzzy dart board. And the wonder, why it just permeates continuously. I have spoken on genealogy to audiences and students, who think they might be interested in beginning their journeys. As I look at the sea of innocence and think of an eager class action lawyer lurking, I feel compelled to offer the budding genealogists a cigarette pack warning, lest I might get sued."CAUTION: genealogical research can become habit forming and may result in obsessive compulsive behavior."So what causes the obsession? Under the section Timelines, the dates of January 2009 and September 2009, might give you insight on mine. If you get started, you will find answers for your obsession. One of my genealogical journeys led me to the robust Taggart family website. On that site I found this quote. “A people which takes no pride in the noble achievements of remote ancestors will never achieve anything worthy to be remembered with pride by remote descendants” - Thomas B. Macauley.  










Perhaps Macauley was right, and if so, perhaps that is why we become so obsessed. Above is a grandfather, who like the edited photograph is fading to a remote ancestor. But sitting on his leg is his granddaughter, his future, who also is destined to fade with time to become a remote descendant.

My first attempt at writing in register format was for a Massachusetts Society of Genealogists, Inc (MSOG) writing contest. Since I was beginning a trilogy on three ancestors, I figured that writing about them in register format would be a good first step and rather easy to do. Boy was I ever wrong. But thanks to the efforts of Helen S. Ullmann, I finally produced something worthy of publication. I have an enormous respect for those researcher who document meticulously their research and I continually strive to be like them, whether when writing in register format or simply documenting an ancestor for my personal data base.My second effort, again for MSOG was about my great grandfather, John Woollacott. He met the criteria for the contest, an immigrant around the turn of the last century, who  worked in a mill. The contest in concert with the 100th anniversary of the 1912 "bread and roses" strike at the mills along the Merrimack River in Lawrence, Massachusetts. That strike was instrumental in changing child labor laws that were virtually non-existent before 1912. I always enjoy looking at old photographs as they  evoke so many images. Study any photograph of a young child working the mills at the turn of the last century and you will appreciate better that hackneyed expression, "A picture is worth a thousand words."In 2007 my brother and I visited our "old sod", High Bickington, Devon, England, where there are more Woollacotts than Smiths. At the conclusion of our trip, I decided that a slew of photographs and accompanying negatives in paper wallets would soon be lost to the ages. So I made a "genealogical lite" photo journal of our trip. It has a greater likelihood of being found, dusted off and perused than dog-eared paper wallets of old photographs.My Woollacott leg is very complete from my four-greats grandparents John and Mary (Down) Woollacott forward. It gets sketchier as I journey further back, even though High Bickington's Yelland Farm and Woollacott have a connection from 1602 to the present day. Thanks to the Wolcott family website, there is considerable information on the Woollacotts and variations thereon. Someday I hope to weave those early threads tighter with more objective evidence to extend past my four-greats grandfather.

Upon landing in Boston in the winter of 1651, Law serves his remaining indenture in the community of Concord as a public shepherd. Although Concord will become his “New Scotland,” Law must negotiate some challenging hurdles to make that happen—Puritan theocracy, English bigotry, and Native American dangers, among others. Throughout all of Law’s ordeals, he wonders if God ever hears him. One day God does. The Immigrant is more than a meticulously researched novel. There are many meaningful layers to savor and several historical puzzles to uncover.  “Woollacott writes with color, creating scenes with drama and pathos.

Alfred Woollacott, III

My genealogical journey began while chauffeuring Jill, her mother and two of their octogenarian cousins around England in 1999. As I lay awake, I said to Jill, "Once I retire, I'm going to work on my family tree." She yawned while saying, "Boy, all these castles, churches and cemeteries have really gotten to you." She slammed her head back down on the pillow for a bit more rest.  In 2002, I retired from KPMG, a firm where I had spent my entire career spanning some 34 years. When a fellow partner asked, "Al, you're too young to retire, what are you going to do now?" I responded, "What I have always done, except I won't be going to work." Filling in the '50 to 60 hour per week void' that retirement created was easy. Believe me, retirement is highly underrated. I honored the vow I made while in England and dabbled with my family history until a post on a genealogy website from a Charles HB Cole looking for information on the Fitchburg Woollacotts captured me. Charles's work was extensive; I was even in it. In no time, the Woollacott leg of my stool was far extended. I was hooked on family history and needed more. When my brother and I traveled to Devon in 2007, we had a lovely lunch with Charles and his family. After lunch, Charles calculated that we were 6th cousins. Like a dutiful auditor, I checked his calculations - he was correct. I told him about the love/hate relationship with genealogy that he had created within me. He laughed, and I sensed he knew what I was experiencing. When his wife added that while on their honeymoon Charles was in the library doing genealogy, I was certain that Charles knew.My maternal grandmother attended DAR meetings in Peterborough. So I contacted their New Hampshire Chapter and gave them the name of Grace Belle (Young) Nault born 3 July 1881. Within a week, I knew my patriot, a Private Reuben Law. My initial fleeting thought -  just a private, I guess it's no Order of Cincinnati for me. But as I researched him further, I found a Private Reuben Law in the Acton Militia who was at the Concord Bridge on April 19th. That had to be him, how many Reuben Laws could there be?  And then I wondered, what was going through the mind of a 23 year old on that morning. That thought was not fleeting, but haunting.My adult life was spent crunching numbers and verifying assertions. So researching dates and concluding on supporting evidence comes easy to me. I received a B. S. in Business Administration ('68) and later an MBA ('71), both from Boston University. English literature, composition and creative writing were not in my college education. And at KPMG, creative writing was strictly forbidden - just the facts and then a conclusion. So transporting my wonder about an ancestor out of my head and onto paper does not come easy. But thanks to local writers like John Hough, Jr. and Cynthia Riggs, who teach Adult Continuing Education ("ACE") on the Vineyard, Grub Street workshops and others, I am learning. But it's never easy.  I do the Friday and Saturday Wall Street Journal crossword puzzles. It is a rare day when I can complete a puzzle in one sitting. But after several iterations, I eventually achieve success. Creative writing is similar; a paragraph or scene is rarely right with just one pass. But unlike crossword puzzles, you 're never sure if you have ever gotten it completely right.So now my family history dabbling has become an obsession with dates and places stuck to my head like tossed Velcro balls hanging from a fuzzy dart board. And the wonder, why it just permeates continuously. I have spoken on genealogy to audiences and students, who think they might be interested in beginning their journeys. As I look at the sea of innocence and think of an eager class action lawyer lurking, I feel compelled to offer the budding genealogists a cigarette pack warning, lest I might get sued."CAUTION: genealogical research can become habit forming and may result in obsessive compulsive behavior."So what causes the obsession? Under the section Timelines, the dates of January 2009 and September 2009, might give you insight on mine. If you get started, you will find answers for your obsession. One of my genealogical journeys led me to the robust Taggart family website. On that site I found this quote. “A people which takes no pride in the noble achievements of remote ancestors will never achieve anything worthy to be remembered with pride by remote descendants” - Thomas B. Macauley.  










Perhaps Macauley was right, and if so, perhaps that is why we become so obsessed. Above is a grandfather, who like the edited photograph is fading to a remote ancestor. But sitting on his leg is his granddaughter, his future, who also is destined to fade with time to become a remote descendant.

Available at Bunch of Grapes in Edgartown and online at Amazon.com.  Read this book.Alfred Woollacott III, an Oak Bluffs resident, has written an extraordinary first novel. Set in the mid-17th century, the book chronicles his ancestor,  John Law, a 14-year-old boy caught up in a Scottish civil war, and the man he becomes as an English prisoner of war sold into indenture in the Massachusetts Bay Colony town of Concord.The Immigrant is a terrific read because it succeeds on its literary merit: well-plotted, with substantive characters. Redolent with details of life on the frontier of the New World,  John Law’s travails put the reader in his hardscrabble life, contending with bigotry, penury, and the unforgiving New England climate in the days before diversity, electric blankets, and supermarkets.  The Immigrant is rooted in a 2002 post-retirement project Mr. Woollacott undertook after a career at global accounting firm KPMG. He spent years researching his family tree, and wrote a genealogy of his forebears. Then he decided, as he told The Times this week, “to put some leaves on the tree,” based on the rich store of information he had amassed.“Furnished with facts, I began to fictionalize their lives,” Mr. Woollacott writes in the acknowledgments to The Immigrant. For that work, he signed up with John Hough Jr., Island author and writing coach. Mr. Hough has a dedication to fine detail in replicating past events and environments which gives his books a real-time feel for readers. The you-are-there quality is evident in Mr. Woollacott’s work here.The actual John Law was a 14-year-old boy in Dunbar, a coastal town in southeast Scotland. Young Law cared for his widowed mother in that rural community, which also happened to be in the path of Oliver Cromwell’s British forces, intent on subduing rebel Covenanters, supporters of the Scots’ King Charles II.  Law is enlisted as a pikeman to face Cromwell’s army, is captured in the Scots’ defeat and was likely sent to the Massachusetts Bay Colony as an indentured servant. Law is greeted with disdain and bigotry by the self-righteous English colonists and is assigned grueling tasks as a wood chopper and collier, until he gets his big break as a shepherd tending sheep on the outskirts of Concord, where he meets the local Native Americans, who are leery but more accepting than the British colonists. The Puritans’ behavior toward the indentured Scots and the indigenous people would enrage a stone statue, and may provide us with insight into the reason they were shown the door by England a generation earlier.Mr. Woollacott brings a taut spiritual dimension to The Immigrant. Law’s search for a father figure, his shame at not being able to care for his mother as he had promised his father, and his efforts to resolve his uncertain view of a just and merciful God, make a continuing and heartfelt dialogue as The Immigrant fights for his place and for his family in a strange land.Mr. Woollacott has done painstaking research into the culture and laws of Puritan Massachusetts, particularly as they related to land ownership. We learn that some were ethical, but many were Bernie Madoff act-alikes.The author expresses his story in his own view that our lives are similar to a four-legged stool, representing our maternal and paternal ancestors who shaped us. In the foreword, Mr. Woollacott asks, “Did our forebears experience what we are now experiencing? And if so, will we react as they once did?”We get a sense of that in an opening chapter flash-forward when Reuben Law, John’s great-grandson, musters at the Concord bridge in 1775 to fight the British, thinking the same thoughts John Law thought 100 years ago at Dunbar.Mr. Woollacott plans a trilogy based on his family’s doings. Those Laws and Woollacotts are a zesty bunch. Turns out that Naamah Carter, an early-19th century family aunt from Peterboro, N.H. and Reuben Law’s granddaughter, was one of Brigham Young’s 27 wives, and went to Utah to find a paradise that was not forthcoming.Mr. Woollacott is currently looking for a publisher for his story. He reports that 60 publishers sent “no interest” letters in response to The Immigrant. Oops. Their bad. My guess is that none of them read it. My hunch is that Aunt Naamah will have suitors.Mr. Woollacott will be reading from The Immigrant on Saturday, February 7 at 2 pm at the Oak Bluffs Library and on Saturday, March 7 at 4pm at the West Tisbury Library. Both events are free and open to the public.
