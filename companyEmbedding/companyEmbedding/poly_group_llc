CHRISTMAS TREES
Polygroup®'s seasonal products have been brightening homes around the world   for over 25 festive years! Our goal is to produce the most realistic and highest   quality artificial Christmas trees, wreaths, and garlands possible. With natural   trees as a guide, we produce thousands of different tree types in a variety of   colors and sizes, ranging from elegant PVC tips to the more luxurious PE   branches. We offer simple unlit trees as well as prelit trees with premium   lighting that comes in clear, multicolored or our signature patented Surebright™ technology   which ensures that the lights will stay lit even if a bulb burns out, breaks or   loosens. In addition, our energy saving LED trees come with a Warmbright™  feature that   is designed to produce the same warm pleasing glow of incandescent bulbs. All of   our trees have been designed for easy setup and features hooked or hinged   branches sitting atop a sturdy stand. Each artificial Christmas tree comes with   either a 2-year or 5-year warranty. 
With our portfolio featuring thousands of tree types and seasonal products,   our team constantly creates new items that are at the forefront of each year's   trends. Of course, our customers' needs are our first priority; therefore,   whether you prefer a classic Fraser Fir, a designer Pink Colored Pine or our   exclusive Miracle Tree™, we can   easily customize a tree type, size, color or shape as requested. At Polygroup®,   we strive to offer the highest quality products for all of your holiday needs.   Please take time to browse a selected sample of our trees in the menu on the   left.




POOLS
Splish, Splash Through Summer 
Summer is the perfect time of the year for outdoor fun and activities. With   bright colors, fun themes, and sturdy construction, Polygroup® has developed tons   of exciting toys and above-ground swimming pools for you and your kids to enjoy   during the hot summer months. We offer a wide range of the best frame pools and   ring pools that can be easily set up right in your own backyard. Take a splash   in our pools and enjoy all the benefits without the hassle and expense of   installing and maintaining a permanent swimming pool. Every pool can come with   accessories such as ground and pool covers, maintenance kits, filters, and our   all-in-one patent pending SkimmerPlus™  filter pump,   which conveniently attaches to the side of your pool and keeps your water clean   through its built-in filtering system and continuous skimming function to remove   debris from the surface. 
To make your summer experience complete, we have a large selection of fun   inflatable toys for the pool and the backyard. From play centers and water   slides to inflatable floats and swim rings, we offer toys appropriate for all   ages - infants to adults. So whether you want to splash around in a Quick Set®   ring pool or just relax on one of our lounges, your entire family will have a   blast playing outdoors with our products.

Still have questions? Please Contact Us.

Where are your Christmas trees and lights sold?
                        Polygroup® holiday products are sold under Polytree®. We also produce trees and lights sold under private label brand names of leading retailers in the U.S. and around the world. Please browse through Our Clients page to see where our products can be found.

How do I set up my Christmas tree?
                        Assembly instructions are provided with your tree. To obtain another copy of the assembly guide, please visit our Downloads page or contact our Customer Service Center for further queries.

What should I do if my Christmas tree is missing some parts?
                        Please fill out the Contact Us form on our website or call our U.S. toll free customer service number at 1(800) 919-0070 for further assistance. 

Will the light string stay on when one bulb burns out?
                        Yes. The light sets are designed to remain lit even when a bulb burns out. However, we recommend replacing missing or burned out bulbs as soon as possible. Failure to do so will shorten the lifespan of the light set.

What should I do if the Christmas tree will not light?
• Please check to make sure that all plugs are properly connected and plugged in. Refer to assembly guide for instructions.
• Please check for blown fuses at the plug, and replace as needed. 
• Please check for loose, broken or missing light bulbs, and replace as needed. (Does not apply to patented SureBright™ premium lights, which should stay lit even if above conditions occur.)
• Please Contact Us, and our Customer Service Representative will be happy to assist you. 

Does my tree come with replacement bulbs and fuses?
                        Yes. Each tree comes with an extra bulbs packet attached to the end of the cord and replacement fuses located inside the plug. Please refer to your instruction manual or our Downloads page for more details. For additional bulbs and fuses, they can be found at most major retailers or contact our Customer Service Center.

How do I replace loose, broken or missing bulbs and change the fuses on my tree or light sets?
                        Please refer to your instructions manual or visit our Downloads page for more information. 

Can I add extra effect adapters like dimmers and blinkers to the tree?
                        No. We don't recommend adding extra electrical devices to the tree, as it may cause fuses to overload. It will also void existing manufacturer's warranty on the product. 

How do I care for my tree?
                        It is highly recommended that you unplug Christmas tree lights before leaving home or going to bed. After the season, you can pack the tree loosely in the original box or in a Christmas tree storage bag and store in a cool dry place. Please see manufacturer's manual for care and safety instructions.

Is my Christmas tree flame retardant? 
                        Yes. The materials used to manufacture the Christmas tree are flame retardant and should not become a fire accelerator. Please follow the safety guidelines included with the instructions manual for proper set up and maintenance of your tree. 

Can my Christmas tree be placed outdoors?
                        No. The trees are intended for indoor use only unless otherwise specified for use both indoors and outdoors. Placing an indoor tree outdoors is dangerous and will void existing manufacturer's warranty. 

What is your warranty policy?
                        We provide a 2-year or 5-year limited warranty on all of our trees. Please refer to your warranty card or visit our Product Support page for more information.

Where are your pool products sold?
                        Polygroup® pool products are sold under several brand names including Polygroup®. We also produce pools sold under private label brand names of leading retailers in the U.S. and around the world. Please browse through Our Clients page to see where our products can be found.

How do I set up my pool?
                        A Set Up Manual is provided with your pool. To obtain another copy of the Set Up Manual, please visit our Downloads page or contact our Customer Service Center for further queries. 

How long does it take to set up my pool?
                        Depending on the size of the pool and the condition of the area where it will be placed, a Quick Set® pool can be ready to fill with water in less than 15 minutes. For a Metal Frame Pool, you should be able to set up the pool in less than an hour.

How much air should be used to inflate the top ring?
                        Do not over inflate any rings of the pool or use high-pressure air compressors. Inflate until the ring is slightly firm to touch. An over inflated ring may burst or lead to leaks in the seam, especially when heated by the sun.

Do I need to prepare the ground or dig a hole for the pool?
                        The pool should be set up on level ground (±2%) free of rocks, branches, other objects and holes. There is no need to dig a hole or otherwise prepare the ground. If you require an extra layer of protection between the ground and pool liner due to your ground conditions, we   recommend using a Polypool® ground cloth. If you have a question about our   ground cloths or would like to purchase one, please contact our Customer Service   Center.

Do I need to install a fence around the pool?
                        Consult your local city building department for requirements for erecting a pool. Some areas require a fence or other device around the pool area to ensure personal safety and security. Always supervise children playing in the pool area, and do not leave them unattended. 

I don't have an electrical outlet outside. How can I connect the filter pump?
                        Contact a qualified, licensed Electrician to install the necessary connection for your filter pump. Always comply with local electrical standards and regulations. Do not use extension cords, and always ensure the pump is connected to an outlet installed with a GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter).

The pump is running, but I don't feel any water being delivered into the pool. Why?
                        When the pump is first started, there may be air present in the chamber that may create a vacuum and prevent water from going through the pump. Slowly open the air valve to release the trapped air and allow the pump to fill with water, then close the air valve. Your pump should be working fine now. 

How long do I need to run my filter pump for?
                        Use the following table as a guideline for how long to operate the pump. We recommend filtering the pool once every day. Note that actual required time depends on the size, amount of use and amount of debris in the pool.

Approximately, how many gallons of water does the pool hold? 
                        See the following table on pool capacity. We recommend filling your pool to 80% capacity and allowing room for water displacement during normal use.

Do I need to add chemicals to the water in my pool?
                        Yes. For sanitation reasons, your pool water should be treated just like any other pool. This may include the use of chlorine and other treatment additives. Consult your local pool supply retailer for recommendations.

How often do I need to change my filter?
                        It depends on the time you run your filter and the amount of sediment in the pool water. Under normal use and conditions, the cartridge should be replaced every two weeks. Failure to change the cartridge will cause the pump to become clogged, reduce performance and may damage the pump.

I run the filter pump regularly, but my pool water has become cloudy or green. Why?
                        The filter pump is designed to remove dirt and small material from the water. However, it does not prevent the growth of algae or other bacteria. We strongly advise the use of pool treatment additives to prevent algae and bacteria growth. Please consult your local pool supply retailer for recommendations.

How often do I need to change the water?
                        With regular filter pump use, the use of pool treatment additives and routine maintenance, you will not need to completely change the water very often. Consult with your local pool supply retailer for more specific advice.

The top ring of my Quick Set® pool has a hole in it, but I can't find the source. Any suggestions?
                        Try using a solution of soapy water. Inflate the top ring, and sponge the soapy water over the ring. Where the air escapes, bubbles should form. Wash away the soap, dry and use a repair patch or other method to repair the hole.

The top ring of my pool is leaking? Will the pool collapse? 
                        No. Although the top ring is designed for support, the pool will remain standing even if all the air is removed from the top ring. However, you should locate and repair the hole in the top ring using a repair patch or other method. This will ensure that your Quick Set® pool will function optimally. 

Where can I get a repair patch for my pool?
                        Please fill out the Contact Us form on our website or call our U.S. toll free customer service number at 
                        1(888) 919-0070 for further assistance.

Grass is growing in the bottom of my pool! Why? Are there holes in my pool?
                        No. Certain species of hardy grass (such as Bermuda) may be able to grow through multiple layers of PVC. You can simply remove the grass if it becomes a problem. It does not create holes in your pool liner, and water will not leak from the grassy area.

Can I dive into the pool?
                        Diving into an above-ground pool is extremely dangerous and should not be done under any circumstances. Serious injury and/or death can result.

What is the pool made of? Is it strong?
						   All frame pools and Quick Set® ring pools are constructed using triple-layer PolyLaminate™ PVC composite material - two outer layers of heavy gauge PVC are laminated to an inner layer of polyester mesh for reinforcement. This material is designed to withstand rigorous use and provide long-lasting durability. 

Do you sell covers or other accessories for my pool?
                        Yes. Please visit your local retailer for a selection of Polypool® above-ground pool accessories. 

What should I do if my pool is missing some parts?
                        Please fill out the Contact Us form on our website or call our U.S. toll free customer service number at 
                        1(888) 919-0070 for further assistance.

Can the pool be left outdoors year round?
                        This depends on where you live and the average temperature in your area. Extreme cold weather may crack and damage the PVC walls. The pool should not be left in temperatures lower than 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit. 

How do I store my pool for the winter?
                        Be sure to completely drain and dry the pool before storage to prevent mold from growing. Store in a dry area where the temperature does not fall below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Tip:  leaving the pool in the sun will soften the vinyl and make it easier to fold for storage.

At Polygroup®, we want you and your family to enjoy a fun and safe summer in your new pool. Our primary concern is your family's   safety, so please practice caution with any pool you purchase. We would like to   share with you some pool safety tips and information. While many of these tips   are directed towards children, pool safety practices are important for adults as   well - especially those who may be inexperienced swimmers. We highly recommend   that you review these tips and visit the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission   (CPSC) website at www.cpsc.gov for more detailed information. 
To ensure that your children are safe, please follow these pool safety tips: 
1. Please carefully read and follow manufacturers' instructions for set up   and maintenance for your new pool. Please also practice caution with pool   chemicals and electrical equipment used near the pool and make sure to follow   any safety advice found on their labels.
2. Do not leave children unattended in and around the pool. Carefully   supervise children and closely watch them around water - even those who know how   to swim.
3. Children can drown in only a few inches of water. Please practice caution   with any type of pool you purchase - including child pools.
4. Please do not dive into above-ground pools. They are too shallow. Serious   injury may result.
5. Prevent unsupervised children from accessing the pool. Do not leave the   pool open and accessible since children can fall inside. The CPSC recommends   installing physical barriers, such as fences with latched gates around pools to   limit access and installing alarms on doors leading from the house to the pool.   Regulations vary from state to state. Please see the CPSC website for more   information, and follow your local regulations.
6. Remove the ladder, and completely cover an above-ground pool when not in   use to help prevent children from entering. Please note that children may also   be able to enter the pool by climbing up the sides. Make sure that the cover of   the pool is completely lifted over the pool. Do not partially open the pool.   Also make sure that your child does not walk over the pool cover.
7. Be prepared in case of emergency. Please make sure that there is always a   life saving flotation device handy near the pool. 
8. Keep rescue equipment, a telephone and emergency numbers handy by the   pool. We recommend that all parents, pool owners and those responsible for   childcare learn basic CPR techniques in case of any accident. 
			  We want to   encourage everyone to enjoy their pools and be safe. For more information about   pool safety, please visit www.cpsc.gov. You can also call their Hotline at (800) 638-2772.
			  
			


At Polygroup®, we want you and your family to have a happy and safe holiday   season. Since many of us decorate with light sets during the holidays, the   Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) and the U.S. Consumer Product   Safety Commission (CPSC) recently published some safety tips and suggestions for   using electrical lights. We highly recommend that you review them and visit www.electrical-safety.org and www.cpsc.gov for more detailed information. 
To ensure that your holiday season is safe from electrical hazards, please   follow these safety tips:
1. Before decorating, read and follow the manufacturers' instructions for   installation and maintenance of all decorative electrical products.
2. Use lights and other electrical decorations certified by a recognized independent testing laboratory, such as UL, ETL, or CSA. This will be displayed   on the packaging.
3. When choosing outdoor lights, please use lights and other electrical   decorations certified for outdoor use. The packaging will note whether the   lights can be used indoors, outdoors, or both. Prevent shock by plugging outdoor decorations into circuits protected by ground fault circuit interrupters   (GFCIs). 
4. Carefully inspect each decoration before plugging into an outlet. Cracked,   frayed, loose or bare wires and loose connections may cause a serious   electrical shock or start a fire. Replace damaged items.
5. Avoid plugging in too many lights and other decorations into a single   outlet. Overloaded outlets can overheat and cause a fire. Please use any extension cords wisely. 
6. Turn off all holiday lights when you go to bed or leave the house. 
                            We want to encourage everyone to enjoy the holidays and be safe. Please visit www.electrical-safety.org and www.cpsc.gov for more electrical safety advice. You can also call the CPSC Hotline at (800) 638-2772.

Where can I purchase replacement parts?
                        Replacement parts for some products are available by calling our Customer Service Department at 1(888)919-0070. Our customer service hours are Monday – Friday, 10am-7pm (Eastern Time)

What are the weight limits for Nordic Peak products?
                      	Twin size mattress - 300 lbs for 1 person
						Full size mattress - 450 lbs for up to 2 people
						Queen size mattress - 650 lbs for up to 2 people


If my airbed has a leak, how can I find it?
                        You can make a mixture of luke warm water and liquid soap. Use a sponge  to apply solution or place in a bottle to squirt the solution on the bed seems. If there is a leak, it will bubble.

Why won’t my bed properly inflate?
                        Some possible reasons and solutions:
						1. The air release valve is open. If the valve is a Boston-style valve, make sure the valve body and cap are tightly closed so air cannot escape after inflation. If the valve is the Rapid Release or QuickFlow valve, close it by using two thumbs to push cover and snap it into place.
						2. The pump is not plugged in. Plug pump into any 110 Volt AC electrical outlet (220V product sold outside North America).
						3. The pump is plugged in, but not turned on. Turn on the power switch on handheld models, and turn the dial to the inflate position for built-in models.


Why does my bed loose air after the first few hours or day?
                        1. Air contraction - Like a hot-air balloon, heated air expands. When it cools off, it contracts. The same thing happens when you pump up an airbed. The heat created during pump up expands the air inside the mattress. After an hour or so, it cools off and the mattress loses volume. Needless to say that if you pumped up your airbed in the heat of the afternoon, it will cool off drastically at night when the temperature may drop. All that is required is to top the air bed off by using the pump.
2. Material expansion - The airbed material can expand slightly when it is pumped up to full volume over time. It will stretch when someone lies down upon it. After time passes, the bed may appear to loose air because of this expansion. In either case, all that is required is to top the airbed off by using the pump. 
3. Air is leaking from the valve – see, "Why won’t my bed properly inflate?"
4. The bed has a puncture or tear – see, "How can I fix a leak that I find in my bed?"

How can I fix a leak that I find in my bed?
                        If you have a puncture or tear in your product, it may be possible to repair the damage by using the Vinyl Repair Kit included with your product. Follow all instructions and heed all warnings included in the repair kit.

Since my airbed has flocking, how can I use the repair patch as it won't adhere to the flocking?
                        The repair patch is designed for vinyl surfaces only. However, with using fine sandpaper, such as an emery board, you can gently rub away the flocking. When that is complete, the repair patch will hold.

How do I deflate my air bed?
                        Some air bed pumps are designed to deflate (or suck air out) in addition to inflating your air bed. Check and see if your air pump comes with a deflate setting; this setting is particularly handy for camping when you want to strike camp quickly. If your pump does not have that feature, you will have to deflate your air bed manually. Unscrew or unsnap the cap of the air valve first, and listen for escaping air. Next, remove your shoes and walk up and down the length of the air bed. Once you've done that a few times, you can start rolling your air bed from the end opposite the air valve to help the remaining air escape. When you have completely rolled up the camping air bed, use a cord or the bed's bag to keep it in that condensed shape. Be sure to close your valve and tighten after deflation, so it is ready for inflation the next time you use it.

How do I take care of or store my air bed?
                        Taking care of an air bed is easy. After you've deflated your bed, simply place it in the handy carry bag or a box. Keep it in a safe spot where it will stay protected from extreme heat, cold, and water. Make sure you keep all sharp objects away from your air bed, as sharp objects can puncture the air mattress and ruin it. If you follow all these steps, you're sure to have the best air bed for you that will remain functional for years to come.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Building a better anti-microbial

Poly Group believes its Nouvex, based on Purdue research, can be a game-changer

Poly Group LLC is betting that if it licenses a better anti-microbial product, the world will beat a path to its door.
The company was formed in 2010 by Jack Haywood and Doug Hamilton, who earlier had begun working with anti-microbials at their company, Pro Laminators in Sellersburg.

They eventually sought to improve their process by pairing up with Jeffrey Youngblood, an associate professor at Purdue University’s School of Materials Engineering in West Lafayette, Ind.
Youngblood had created an innovation known as a hydrophilized bactericidal polymer technology.
Poly Group exists to commercialize that research, and the product currently goes by the commercial name of Nouvex.
The company is located in the Purdue Research Park of Southeast Indiana in New Albany.
Wide applications
Nouvex investors — about 60 people have contributed about $3 million since 2010 — believe the product could be a game-changing anti-bacterial and anti-viral product.
Craig Kalmer, chief operating officer at Poly Group, said it kills 99.9 of most bacteria it contacts, and it does so in about one to 10 minutes.
Nouvex’s formulation allows it to become part of a product.
Paper or plastic could be infused with Nouvex, and it can be mixed into the durable coatings applied to things such as doorknobs, where it will fight bacteria as long as the coating lasts.





Plastic laminates can have Nouvex infused throughout, as can floors.
Kalmer thinks the applications are limitless, including a possible health care use. Urinary catheters, which often cause problems for patients because of bacterial buildup, can have Nouvex added.
Massive market
Kalmer said Poly Group is awaiting approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency before it can begin officially selling and licensing Nouvex. That result is expected anytime before August.
Purdue University owns the patent on the product, and the Poly Group has the exclusive license to take the technology to market.
Kalmer said the anti-microbial additives market is a $6 billion to $7 billion industry, which leads Nouvex investors to believe it could deliver huge returns on their investments. “Our goal is that within the next five years, we get about 10 percent of that,” he said.

New product
One reason for Kalmer’s optimism is that Nouvex can be added easily to products that already have made it to the market. “It’s going to be a lower-cost, better alternative to what’s out there today,” he said.
And there seems to be no direct competition. Kalmer said the EPA considers Nouvex a “brand-new entity.”
Business First asked Kalmer whether he had any concerns that Nouvex could draw challenges over potential vulnerabilities.
For example, the anti-bacterial triclosan, which is widely used in hand soap and toothpaste, has drawn the interest of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.




 


While emphasizing that further study is needed, the agency said that studies raise the possibility that triclosan contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
Kalmer said Nouvex works differently, attacking bacteria in a way that bleach would, damaging the bacteria’s cell walls. Antibiotics, meanwhile, penetrate into bacteria, which can develop a sort of “pump” mechanism that allows it to expunge the chemical.
This won’t happen with Nouvex, he said, and the company believes this eliminates the possibility of super-bugs.
“Nouvex doesn’t have to go into the cell in order to kill it,” he said. “Based on our testing, we do not cause any sort of mutation in the organization, so we do not anticipate that being an issue.”

About Poly Group LLC
Business: The company has developed an anti-microbial called Nouvex
Founded: 2010
Address: 3000 Technology Ave., Suite N2221, New Albany
Website: www.polygroupllc.net
Employees: Two — Craig Kalmer, chief operations officer, and Thomas A. Hopkins, chief scientific officer
Financing:$3 million in investment from about 60 investors. The company has no sales yet, as its signature product, Nouvex, is awaiting EPA approval.

One of a kind
Poly Group’s signature product, Nouvex, is a category unto itself, according to chief operations officer Craig Kalmer.
When Kalmer submitted Nouvex’s information to the EPA for approval, he said, the agency categorized Nouvex as “a brand new entity.”
The government, he said, had never seen anything quite like it before.

History of Poly Group






 




In 2008, Jack Haywood and Doug Hamilton, the co-founders of Poly Group, LLC and laminators for the printing trade through their company, Pro Laminators in Sellersburg, Indiana, were searching for antimicrobial solutions for the manufacture of printed and laminated products such as menu’s and other end-use items. This led them to silver-ion technology and their efforts helped bring the first antimicrobial thermo laminating film to the market.
 
In an effort to try to improve the film technology, Haywood and Hamilton sought the advice of Dr. Jeffrey Youngblood, an associate professor in the School of Materials Engineering at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. This led them to the Purdue Research Park of Southeast Indiana in New Albany, Indiana and its high-tech business incubation program.
With the assistance of Paul Moses, the incubation program’s director and an entrepreneur himself, the expanded goal of addressing rampant public health problems created by the spread of dangerous organisms was established. With Purdue’s support and collaboration, further research on Dr. Youngblood’s innovation known as Hydrophilized Bactericidal Polymer Technology (HBP) was begun.
Poly Group, LLC was formed in 2010 and soon after secured the exclusive worldwide rights to HBP from Purdue. Proof of concept continued and by the end of 2011, the company was raising capital and a research laboratory was set up and headed by Craig Kalmer and Thomas Hopkins, PhD. Both had extensive experience in pharmaceutical research and production and both were former executives in other companies.
A patent for the technology, now known as Nouvex™, was secured in late 2012 and the company signed its first joint development agreement. In 2013, the research laboratory was expanded. A detailed testing strategy for obtaining the proper approvals from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was also established in preparation for taking Nouvex to market.
The company continued to raise capital to finance the proper EPA-mandated efficacy and toxicology testing. The testing continued with outstanding results and by the summer of 2014, all research to file the proper EPA applications had been successfully completed.
Pending final EPA registration and approval, the company expects to go to market with Nouvex™, a groundbreaking and highly effective antimicrobial technology, in early 2017.

Nouvex Antimicrobial






 





 
Nouvex™ technology was discovered at Purdue University. Poly Group LLC has secured an exclusive, worldwide license to the IP covering Nouvex™ technology which includes a granted US patent.
The Nouvex™ technology is positively charged, so it attracts negatively charged pathogens and destroys them on contact without inducing the resistance. Nouvex™ is high-speed.  It also has very high efficacy, which makes it competitive with disinfectants as opposed to traditional antimicrobial additives. Nouvex™ is also highly persistent and has high surface endurance because it is integrated directly into the material. Other market competitors are not as valuable because they are applied as a coating that can wipe or wear off over time. This integrated character of Nouvex™ makes it very desirable for medical uses, textiles, plastics and even glass applications. Nouvex™ also gets high biocompatibility ratings and is more biocompatible than other current antimicrobials. Nouvex™ creates no chemical binding or linking issues, unlike other quaternary ammonium compounds and has a large molecular structure providing limited toxicity. Tunable physical properties allow formulas to be tweaked for efficacy and biocompatibility. It can also be soluble or non-soluble in water or solvents, which allows for a great variety of product applications.
On top of everything else, Nouvex™ formulas are easy to synthesize, making it relatively inexpensive to produce. Its manufacturing costs are low. Nouvex™ has proven performance through testing at GLP (Good Lab Practice) Laboratories, so the EPA preservative and health claims will be accessible to the end-use product manufacturers. All this makes Nouvex™ an immediate replacement for silver ions, triclosan, copper, and other quaternary substances with little or no process modification.
The efficacy testing was done on a variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria, including: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile (C. diff), Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli MS2 bacteriophage.
