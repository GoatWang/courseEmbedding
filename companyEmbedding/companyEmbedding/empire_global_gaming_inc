Empire Global Gaming, Inc. Launches Software Development Initiative for Online Gaming Platform







Share














Business Wirevia The Motley Fool, AOL.com
May 30th 2013 8:51AM




Empire Global Gaming, Inc. Launches Software Development Initiative for Online Gaming PlatformBELLPORT, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Empire Global Gaming, Inc (OTC: EPGG) announced today that it has launched a new and more robust interim website (www.empireglobalgaminginc.com) to enhance its presence on the World Wide Web, and to give players, investors and the gaming public the ability to better view its portfolio of proprietary games.The Company is also actively pursuing the potential expansion into the online casino arena, with the creation and launch of it's own online platform to support its portfolio of proprietary games. The company wants to capitalize on the fast-evolving changes and opportunities in the Online arena by bringing its games to this sector. It intends to accomplish this by direct launch and operation, and/ or by licensing to "brick and mortar casinos" seeking to develop their own online presence.To that end, the Company has engaged the software development division of Intech Creative LLC to begin the process of developing its online gaming platform, which will be available both online and via mobile devices (to be developed to support iOS by Apple, Android, MS Mobile, and Blackberry platforms)."It's no longer a question of if Internet gaming is coming; it's a question of when," said Frank Fahrenkopf, president of the American Gaming Association, the trade organization for the nation's commercial brick-and-mortar casinos. The mobile gambling market is expected to be worth more than a hundred billion dollars by 2017, with online gaming companies expected to scoop a net profit of $45 billion dollars in the process. The study, which was carried out by mobile device experts Juniper research, also revealed that mobile gaming is the fastest growing sector in the gambling market as a whole.In an article released on April 19 mobile casino specialists are hedging their bets on an 'historic shift' towards mobile or 'ubiquitous' computing. It would seem that mobile casino is outpacing the very context of online gambling from which it has emerged, while Europe and the US begin courting regulated Web-based gambling.Empire Global Gaming, Inc. is currently aligning itself with key players in the online and mobile gambling sectors so that it may take full advantage of this incredible timing.Nicholas Sorge Sr. Founder & President of Empire Global Gaming, Inc. says: "It is our mission to stay on the cutting edge of this technology-driven Industry. The enhancement of our website is the first step in doing so."Bruce Dugan, CEO of Intech Creative LLC said: "We are enthused to be a part of Empire's exciting plans, and look forward to delivering them a new and innovative approach to online gaming platform technology to enable their games to be enjoyed by the consumer marketplace. We've built this new interim website to better present in an eye-shot what the company is about, with easy navigation, even while we are planning the buildout of a more robust site to be launched in the coming weeks."About Empire Global Gaming, Inc.: Empire Global Gaming, Inc. (the "Company") is incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada and participates in the worldwide gaming market. We offer custom game manufacturing, gaming solutions, supplies and custom game marketing. We provide consulting and advisory services to the gaming industry. We hold exclusive licenses for proprietary Class II and Class III grade Table Games for use in the home and casinos, as well as the rights to several other innovative board, dice, card and electronic games for use in the home and casinos. We hold licenses for eight patented Class II and III Casino Grade Mechanical & Electronic Games. The games include (i) proprietary 20 sided dice game, (ii) combination game of poker and blackjack, side bet blackjack, and (iii) five patents covering roulette. We also created a new proprietary variation on the standard deck of playing cards (patent pending). We anticipate that these cards will be used in retail and casino sales.Our currently expanding business development goals are to implement all of our New Technologies in Casinos around the world and to develop worldwide and online gaming rights to provide for acceleration of our revenue growth.About Intech Creative LLC: Intech Creative LLC is an American company organized in the state of Delaware, with its corporate and web-tools operations based In New York, and software application studio in Bangalore, India and Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The net proceeds to Empire Global Gaming, Inc. from the sale of the shares of 
Common Stock offered are estimated to be approximately net $2,477,850 if all 
shares in this offering are sold, provided the offering expenses are $22,150. 
Although this offering is self-underwritten by the Officers and Directors, 
certain “underwriting costs” will be incurred.  The “underwriting costs” 
consist of certain filing, legal and accounting fees.  Empire Global 
Gaming, Inc. intends to use these proceeds for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, as follows: 

The following table shows the Company’s use of net proceeds if 10%, 25%, 50%, 
75%, and 100% of the shares are sold. There can be no assurance that any 
shares will be sold in this offering.  The Company intends to raise two 
million, five hundred thousand USD ($2,500,000) through a Form S-1 
registration as mentioned in the Form S-1 section above.  Selling 10,000,000 
shares of its Common Stock at $0.25 per share will result in the dilution of 
ownership by approximately 17.1%.  The total outstanding shares at completion 
of the offering will be 60,000,000.  The Company’s net proceeds from the 
offering will be $2,477,850 net of self underwriting costs. 
  
Upon the sale of 10% of its public offering, (after underwriting costs of 
$22,150, net proceeds will be $227,850), the Company intends to file an 
application to obtain permits that will allow the playing of its roulette 
games in the State of New Jersey.  This process will, according to the 
Company’s legal counsel, take from six months to one year.  It could take 
longer or we may never be permitted.  Legal and Gaming Consultant’s fees 
will aggregate $200,000.  If only 10% of this offering is sold, Management 
will be required to implement an emergency “minimal burn rate” of $2,000 
per month by cutting monthly overhead to only general and administrative 
expenses ($500), legal and accounting ($1,000) and website promotion ($500).  
This can be accomplished because the Company’s corporate attorneys (not to 
be confused with Gaming Control Board attorneys) and accountants have agreed 
to cut their fees to a minimum of $500 each per month should it become 
necessary in order to sustain the Company for twelve months beyond filing 
with the New Jersey Gaming Commission.  Also, the Company can sustain itself 
on $500 per month general and administrative expenses because the Company 
will pay no salaries, no rent or other major expenditures while waiting for 
Gaming Board approval. 
  
Upon the sale of 25% of its public offering, (after underwriting costs of 
$22,150, net proceeds will be $602,850), the Company will start the process 
towards full implementation of our business plan except that the Company 
will not have any available funds to conduct any advertising of its games 
or products.
  
The following table shows EGGI's use of net proceeds if 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 
and 100% of the shares are sold.   There can be no assurance that any shares 
will be sold in this offering.  This offering is “self-underwritten” and 
shares will be sold without the use of an underwriter.

(1)  Reflective of “emergency burn rate” of $2,000 per month. 
  
The allocation of the net proceeds of the offering set forth above represents 
EGGI's best estimates based upon its current plans and certain assumptions 
regarding industry and general economic conditions and EGGI's future revenues 
and expenditures.  If any of these factors change, EGGI may find it necessary 
or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds within the above-described 
categories. Working capital includes payroll, office expenses and supplies, 
insurance, and other general expenses.  None of the proceeds are allocated to 
officers’ salaries, or payments to any directors or affiliates. 

Proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described above will be 
invested temporarily, pending their application as described above, in 
short-term United States government securities, short-term bank certificates 
of deposit, money market funds or other investment grade, short-term, 
interest-bearing instruments.


Casino City ( www.casinocity.com/casinos/ ) reports that there are currently 
over 5,000 gambling casinos worldwide indicating that EGGI’s market is in 
over 140 counties worldwide. 

Upon obtaining permits in New Jersey, the Company will immediately commence 
its attempts to sell the permitted roulette games to casinos located in that 
State. Atlantic City, NJ,  has approximately 13 casinos that have an average 
of 10 roulette games each.  

In the event that the Company is successful in selling 25% of its public
offering, then the Company would file for permits with the Nevada Gaming 
Control Board.   The market for our licensed gaming products is worldwide 
and the Company has no competition other than existing games in place being 
utilized by casinos worldwide. 

We also have a worldwide market for our other gaming products consisting of 
various *Class II and **Class III casino electronic and table games and other 
related products. They consist of public & casino grade gaming products for 
roulette, blackjack, craps, baccarat, mini baccarat, pinwheels, Sic Bo, slot 
machines, poker tables and bingo games.  We have intense competition 
throughout the world with these products.  Our e-commerce website, 
although “state of the art” faces extreme competition with price being 
the key to success.
