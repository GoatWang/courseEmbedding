History[edit]
GP Strategies Corporation was founded in 1959 under the name National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC) as a venture capital firm focusing on technology companies. In 1960 it went public.
In 1986, NPDC purchased majority ownership of General Physics Corporation (“GP” or “General Physics”), which was established in 1966. Originally, GP provided technical services to the Navy Submarine Nuclear Power Program in the areas of operations, safety, and training. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, GP expanded its service offering and industry focus through internal investment and acquisitions that expanded its reach into environmental, energy, IT, and other government markets.
In 1998, NPDC changed its name to GP Strategies Corporation. In 2003, GP Strategies decided to focus on its training, engineering, and consulting business operated by GP and embarked on a plan to spin-off certain non-core assets to stockholders. In November 2004, GP Strategies spun off its non-core assets into a separate corporation which was named National Patent Development Corporation. In September 2005, GP Strategies completed the spin-off of all of its non-core assets with the spin-off of its ownership in GSE Systems.
From 2005 to 2011, GP Strategies was a holding company, consisting solely of its wholly owned operating subsidiary, General Physics. Effective January 1, 2012, GP Strategies merged with and into General Physics, eliminating the holding company structure. General Physics was the surviving legal corporation and was renamed GP Strategies Corporation effective with the merger. Following the merger, there were no material changes to the company’s financial position, business operations, state of incorporation, directors, executive officers, or management.
Today, GP Strategies serves a variety of industries, including aerospace, automotive, pharmaceutical, financial, healthcare, electronics, food & beverage, energy, metals, process industries, petrochemical, and telecommunications, as well as state, local, and federal governments. Its service offerings have also grown to meet the needs of its customers. GP Strategies delivers training, performance improvement services, training business process outsourcing, lean consulting and operational excellence consulting, engineering, construction management, homeland security services, and many other services that improve an organization’s operating performance and competitiveness. [9]
Company Structure[edit]
GP Strategies currently operates with four operating segments: Learning Solutions, Professional and Technical Solutions, GP Sandy and Performance Readiness Solutions.
Learning Solutions[edit]
The Learning Solutions segment delivers training, curriculum design and development, e-Learning services, system hosting, training business process outsourcing and consulting services globally. This segment also offers organizational performance solutions including leadership training and employee engagement tools and services. This segment serves large companies in the electronics and semiconductors, healthcare, software, financial services and other industries as well as government agencies.[10]
Professional and Technical Solutions[edit]
This segment provides training, consulting, engineering and technical services, including lean consulting, emergency preparedness, safety and regulatory compliance, chemical demilitarization and environmental services primarily to large companies in the manufacturing, steel, pharmaceutical and petrochemical industries, federal and state government agencies, and large government contractors.[11]
GP Sandy[edit]
The GP Sandy segment provides custom product sales training and serves manufacturing customers in the US automotive industry for over 30 years. GP Sandy provides custom product sales training designed to better educate customer sales forces with respect to new vehicle features and designs. This segment also provides technical training services to automotive manufacturers as well as customers in other industries.[12]

GP Strategies Reports Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results






Jul 27, 2017, 6:45am EDT














COLUMBIA, Md., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Global performance improvement solutions provider GP Strategies Corporation (NYSE: GPX) today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
Overview:

Revenue of $131.2 million for second quarter of 2017, an increase from $125.5 million for second quarter of 2016
Operating income of $9.1 million for second quarter of 2017, an increase from $8.2 million for second quarter of 2016 
Diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for second quarter of 2017, an increase from $0.29 per share for second quarter of 2016
Cash flow from operations of $19.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase from $10.0 million for the same period in 2016
The Company's revenue increased $5.6 million or 4% during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016. The revenue growth was primarily attributable to a 22% increase in the Performance Readiness Solutions segment, due to both acquisitions and organic growth, as well as organic growth in both the Learning Solutions and Sandy Training & Marketing segments due to increased training services. Foreign currency exchange rate declines resulted in a total $3.2 million or 3% decrease in U.S. dollar reported revenue during the second quarter of 2017. 
Gross profit increased $2.1 million or 10% to $22.4 million or 17% of revenue for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $20.3 million or 16% of revenue for the second quarter of 2016. Operating income increased 12% to $9.1 million for the second quarter of 2017 from $8.2 million for the second quarter of 2016. Income before income taxes was $8.5 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $8.0 million for the second quarter of 2016. Income tax expense decreased to $2.6 million, or a 31% effective tax rate, for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $3.1 million or a 38% effective tax rate, for the second quarter of 2016. Net income was $5.9 million, or $0.35 per share, for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $4.9 million, or $0.29 per share, for the second quarter of 2016. 
"GP Strategies reported second quarter 2017 EBITDA of $10.8 million compared to $10.0 million for the corresponding quarter in 2016" stated Scott N. Greenberg, Chief Executive Officer. "The Company achieved this 7% increase in EBITDA while incurring approximately $1.1 million of financial system implementation costs during the quarter. In addition, all of our operating segments reported increased gross margins during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016. The Company accomplished this solid performance despite a $3.2 million decline in U.S. dollar reported revenue from foreign currency fluctuations. GP Strategies continued its acquisition strategy and in April completed the acquisition of Emantras, which is based in India and strengthens our eLearning content development capabilities. We are currently evaluating additional acquisition opportunities."
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights  As of June 30, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $23.7 million compared to $16.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company had $34.0 million of long-term debt outstanding as of June 30, 2017.  In addition, the Company had $24.5 million of short-term borrowings outstanding and $70.1 million of available borrowings under its line of credit as of June 30, 2017.  
Cash provided by operating activities was $19.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $10.0 million for the same period in 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 101,000 and 340,000 shares, respectively, of its common stock in the open market for a total cost of approximately $2.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, there was approximately $3.6 million available for future repurchases under the buyback program.
Investor Call  The Company has scheduled an investor conference call for 10:00 a.m. EDT on July 27, 2017. In addition to prepared remarks from management, there will be a question and answer session on the call. The dial-in numbers for the live conference call are 800-954-0683 or 415-226-5357, using conference ID number 21856255. A telephone replay of the call will also be available beginning at 12:00 p.m. on July 27th, until 12:00 p.m. on August 10th. To listen to the replay, dial 800-633-8284 or 402-977-9140, using conference ID number 21856255. A replay will also be available on GP Strategies' website shortly after the conclusion of the call.
Presentation of Non-GAAP Information  This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and free cash flow (cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures). The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's results. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for, or superior to, either net income, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or cash flow, as a measure of the Company's liquidity. In addition, because these measures may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For a reconciliation of EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP equivalent, see the Non-GAAP Reconciliation – EBITDA, along with related footnotes, below.

Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a widely used non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance. It is presented as supplemental information that the Company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the Company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute either for net income, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or for cash flow, as a measure of the Company's liquidity. In addition, because EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History

History in The Making

The GP Strategies story starts in 1966 with the founding of the General Physics Corporation (GP). Before that, it was known as National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC).
In 1998, NPDC officially changed its name to GP Strategies Corporation and over time embarked on a committed path of acquisition and global expansion.
2002 saw GP Asia established in Singapore.
2005 saw the spin-off of its ownership in GSE Systems, concluding the spin-off of all GP Strategies non-core assets.
In 2006, GP Strategies opened its first office in India: GP Consulting (India) Pvt Ltd.
2006 onwards saw strategic acquisitions of companies such as Peters Management Consultancy, Sandy Corporation, Bath Consultancy Group, and many more.
2007 saw the incorporation of GP Hong Kong.
In 2012, GP Strategies merged with and into General Physics Corporation, eliminating the holding company structure. General Physics was the surviving legal corporation and was renamed GP Strategies Corporation effective January 1, 2012.
Today, GP Strategies serves a variety of industries in no less than 24 countries on four continents, proudly making it a global performance company.
