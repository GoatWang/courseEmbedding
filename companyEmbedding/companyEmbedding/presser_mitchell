Conversation with Zach Reineking, Superintendent of 2017 U.S. Open
As the US Open quickly approaches, Zach Reineking, superintendent of Erin Hills, discusses the success they have had using both TriCure & Terafirm.












Water Conservation
Water conservation is a critical component of turf and plant management, especially in times of drought and imposed water restrictions. TriCure AD helps optimize water management programs, saving water while improving plant health.

Environmental Stewardship
Keeping pond and lake water clear without the use of algaecides fits into an environmentally sensitive program. Consider Pond Pucks as an all natural way to keep your ponds clear and healthy.

Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.
Using renewable products is good for the environment and good for business. Terreplex is an all-natural product produced from the lignin in trees which can improve soil quality and plant health without the use of fertilizers or synthetic products.

Regulation Tightening
As regulations on the use of fungicides tighten, safe and effective alternatives to fungicide use become more necessary. DewCure reduces moisture buildup on turf, helping prevent the conditions that are favorable to turf disease.

From skincare products that leave your face hydrated and wrinkle-free and hair products for gorgeous locks to oral care for the entire family, you can find all the beauty products you need at Every Day Low Prices at Walmart. Here are some helpful beauty products to stock up on. Skin care  Whether you're looking for skin care products with anti-aging properties or for a treatment for skin problems such as acne or rosacea, our selection includes something for each skin type. In order for your skin to be radiant and healthy, it's important to use products that are suitable for your skin type. Because each skin type has its own needs, it's a good idea to  establish whether you have a normal, dry, oily or combination skin before choosing products geared toward your type.  Essential skincare products include skin cleansers and soaps, daily moisturizers with sunscreen, night moisturizers, toners and masks.  Sunscreen combats the visible effects of aging that sun damage can cause, so make sure you apply it whenever you go out in the sun. Alternatively, look for daily moisturizers with SPF. Developing a skin care regimen is vital for healthy skin, so start with the basic steps of cleaning, moisturizing, and applying sunscreen every day in the morning. Use a face wash, toner and moisturizer, and apply any treatments or serums after your toner but before your moisturizer. Remember there's no need to use your SPF products at night. Makeup Finding the right kind of makeup that suits you perfectly can be daunting, and just like in the case of skincare products, you need to use something that works well with your skin type. If you're searching for foundations and concealers, there's the added step of finding the color that matches your skin tone exactly (or mixing several to get the right shade). Keep your skin tone in mind as you search. To determine it, look at the veins in your arms. If they have a blue tint, you're cool toned; if they have a green tint, you're warm toned and if you have both, neutral shades will work for you.  Whether you want to create a natural look for the day or something more dramatic for the evening, there are certain products that are essential for any makeup bag. These include foundation to create a smooth surface, powder to set your makeup, lipstick to accent your mouth, and eyeliner, eyeshadow and mascara to define your eyes.  Use the right cosmetic tools to apply your makeup to get the best results. A couple of essentials include a blush brush to apply powder and blush, an eyelash curler to define your lashes before applying mascara, a good make-up mirror so you can see all the details and a makeup remover or toner to eliminate all residue from your skin without drying it out. Hair products  When you think about hair products, shampoo and conditioner the first things to come to mind, but there are even more products available to enhance the look and texture of your locks.  Leave-in conditioner helps you untangle and comb your hair easily, while hair oil can keep the ends frizz-free and polished.  If you blow-dry or straighten your hair regularly, don't forget to use a heat-protection spray to keep your hair feeling soft and moisturized. Hairspray and wax are excellent for creating hairstyles that last through the day or night. Fragrances  Whether you're looking for a fragrance for women or men, determine the notes that you prefer in the overall scent. You can also choose different formulations; eau de parfums are the strongest and have the longest staying power, eau de toilettes are lighter than eau de parfums and body splashes and sprays are light without as much staying power. All perfumes have three different layers called base, top and middle notes. These all work together to create a particular smell. Common choices include floral, fruity, exotic, or musk scents. Always pay attention to the description of a perfume to determine whether it s a good choice for your lifestyle and personality. Oral care Maintain your family's oral health with products that help them keep their teeth clean and their breath fresh every day. From toothpaste and mouthwash to toothbrushes and water picks, our selection of oral care products has something suitable for all ages. Toothpaste comes in many forms, ranging from gel and paste formulations to spearmint and cinnamon flavors, so it s important to choose one that suits your teeth. For example, if you have sensitive teeth, you may want to use a toothpaste designed specifically to reduce the pain associated with this condition. Mouthwash is essential for protecting your mouth from gum disease and fighting bacteria, with fresh breath being an added benefit. Water picks can help you keep you remove any residue from braces or other kind of dental work that tends to trap food.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147384893, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

To have and maintain a healthy head of hair, there are many products available to help you accomplish just that. shampoos, conditioners, styling and cutting tools, hair brushes and much more all might become part of your daily ritual to keep your hair looking good. With low prices, every day, on everything, you can get the hair care supplies you need for less. Here's how to figure out what you need.ShampoosNo matter what type of hair you have, there's a shampoo just for you. There are shampoos specific to men's, women's and children's hair. Other hair conditions that shampoo can improve include dandruff, oily hair or frizzy hair. If you have dry or damaged hair, there are hydrating shampoos that can reverse the damage. Fine, thin hair is easy to protect and improve through the use of shampoos designed to add volume and texture. For simplicity, there are also shampoos and conditioners combined into one product.ConditionersConditioners help maintain various types of hair as well. If you have color-treated hair, it helps to use a conditioner that maintains the color and retains the treatment longer. All types of hair can benefit from the proper conditioner, including curly, frizzy, thick, long, straight, dry, oily and fine hair. Some conditioners are those that you massage into your hair, then rinse out immediately. Some, you massage in and leave in for a few minutes. There are even some conditioners that require you to leave them in overnight, especially if you have damaged or heat-styled hair.Hair coloring productsWhen choosing hair coloring products, the two most common reasons are to change the color of your hair or to address a specific issue, such as creating highlights in your hair or covering up some gray hair. Although hair coloring can be gender- and age-specific, most people can use any type of hair coloring. Some hair coloring products are extremely simple to use and just require you to brush the color in or even lather the color, much like you'd with shampoo. When coloring your hair, the time involved is directly related to how much you're changing the color. If you're just changing your shade slightly, the time involved is minimal. However, if you're going dark brown to light blonde, for example, there are several steps involved and a great deal of time involved. There are also temporary hair colors you can add in, representing many assorted colors   including those not normally found on hair   that naturally wash out after several showers.Styling productsProbably no tool is more important when it comes to styling hair than the hair dryer. These powerful devices allow you to both blow dry your hair and style it at the same time. hair dryers reduce the amount of time it takes to dry your hair by a great deal. Hair dryers are available by the amount of wattage they use and what type of accessories they have. Many hair dryers run on 1,875 watts but can have fewer than 1,000 watts and more than 2,000 watts. If you use curlers or prefer that salon-like feeling while at home, there are also bonnet-style hair dryers that cover your head completely.A couple of other key styling tools for hair are curling irons and flat irons. Although they work much the same way, one makes small or large curls, and the other one flattens and straightens hair   both with heat. Both types of irons are available in varied sizes, with most being between 3/4 of an inch to 2 inches wide. Larger sizes work best on thicker hair.Other hair care productsAll of the styling you want to do with your hair is much easier with a good hair brush or comb to remove tangles and smooth things out. Some common types include natural, synthetic and mixed bristle brushes that are either paddle, vented, round, teasing or wet brushes. Bristle brushes are good for using with long hair, and synthetic or mixed bristle brushes don't create as much static as natural bristle brushes. Natural bristle brushes are soft and help spread your hair's natural oils throughout your hair, making it look shiny.Paddle brushes are flat and wide and work well when doing a blowout on your hair. Vented brushes, with their increased airflow, help cut down drying time even more. Round brushes also work well when doing a blowout and help create extra volume. Teasing brushes allow you to tease the ends of your hair in different styles for more volume. Rattail combs make it easier for you to section hair for braids and other styles. Wide-tooth combs are easier on your hair when it's wet and reduce breakage.For holding hair in place, you can use barrettes, French combs, claw clips, snap clips, headbands, bobby pins or elastic bands. These allow you to hold your hair in different styles, such as ponytails, pigtails, updos and French twists.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167700716, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Hot Off The Press Paul Mitchell Review | Best Heat Protectant











































 











Guide to Gorgeous Hair
everything you want to know









Hot Off The Press Paul Mitchell Review 


Product: Hot Off The Press Paul Mitchell
Price: view current price
Cheapest Place to Buy: Amazon.com
My Rating: 9.5/10
 

 
First of all, this Hot Off The Press Paul Mitchell spray is the best hair product you will ever buy. Hot Off The Press is a 2-in-one thermal protectant + flexible hairspray.
Since I’ve gotten this heat protectant hairspray, I know I will never be in search for another product for either thermal protection or hairspray. You can’t fix what’s not broken; In other words, you can’t do better than perfection. I’ve recently added Hot Off The Press to my vanity collection and I’ve never been happier with a product.
 
What Makes it the Best Heat Protectant Spray for Hair?
There are many reasons that lead to Hot Off The Press being the best heat protectant spray for hair. It can help you get whatever hairstyle you want, easily, without causing damage. Styling your hair can be such a struggle if your hair products don’t work the way you want or the way they’re supposed to. Here are some reasons why Hot Off The Press is the best:
 
› It doesn’t spray out in liquid squirts that will make your hair feel wet and greasy. I’ve had such bad experiences with heat protectant sprays and serums that have made my hair oily in the styling process, or shortly after.
 
› It doesn’t spray as a normal hairspray either, which is rough and forceful. Hot Off The Press releases as a light mist that perfectly coats the strands of hair with protection that isn’t oily nor crusty.
 
› The hold is flexible yet lasts for days. I’m sitting here with three day old curls which I’m not so sure is a good thing because it’s a little gross that I haven’t showered.
 
› You only have to spray your hair twice to protect it from hot styling tools and hold the hair style in place:
– First it is used for thermal protection, sprayed on dry hair before you start styling, then brushed through to work it into your hair.
– Then it is used as a hairspray to hold the style you’ve created, whether it’s straightened, curled or in an up-do.
*However, my personal preference when curling is to spray each lock before I curl it, for extra protection. You don’t have to do this though.
 
› It will not cause your hair to fade and it’ll actually protect your hair from fading since hot styling tools cause hair color to dull.
 
› It basically makes getting ready a fun time, just make sure to blast your favorite jams while sitting at your vanity doing your hair.
 
Anything Bad About Hot Off The Press Paul Mitchell?
It’s difficult to try coming up with cons for Hot Off The Press since it’s become my new best friend. This may seem like a job interview question where the interviewer asks about weaknesses and the interviewee turns a weakness into a strength… But the only con I can think of is that this heat protectant hairspray will make you not want to shower because your hair-do lasts for days after using it. It’s like you don’t want to ruin such cute hair by washing it.
It is debatable whether the price is a con or not. To me it’s a great price for such awesomeness.
 

 
I personally think everyone who uses hot styling tools on their hair is going to need this Hot Off The Press Paul Mitchell product. I’m amazed by it.

I don’t use a lot of products on my hair because like you said, they often make my hair oily or feeling yucky. My main problems are frizziness and knots (plus I need to get a haircut – that would probably help the knot problem.) Does this product leave your hair with that kinda crunchy, kinda sticky feel that other hairsprays do?

I have always had a problem with most products because of oily hair issues so I know what you mean.
Hot Off The Press definitely doesn’t leave a crunchy sticky feel like other hairsprays. You’ll notice that after you use it, your hair feels soft and amazing, yet the hairstyle still holds perfectly.

Great review.  May i know what else you would suggest for ppl who like to iron their hair daily.  i’ve been ironing my hair to straighten it everyday without applying any thermal protectant.  Lately i noticed that my hair had become more fizzy especially the hair end.  appreciate if you recommend some right product for me.  thanks.

Sammy,
This exact product is what you need. It’s okay for every day use to protect your hair from heat. It won’t make your hair oily or hard. Your hair is seeing breakage at the ends from not using protectant since that’s the most fragile part of the hair. If you spray Hot Off The Press everyday before straightening, you’ll notice that the heat doesn’t have an impact on your hair anymore, and your hair will also stay straighter, longer.

Was doing some research for my girlfriend on hair products and ran across your page.  I actually just picked up some Hot Off The Press for her and she LOVES it.  She used to use a product called “Big Sexy Hair” but it wasn’t giving her the long lasting effects she needed.  It would wear off mid-day and her hair would look like a mess.  After using Hot Off The Press for about a week, she really seems to like it.  Good Info

John,
I’m glad your girlfriend found this amazing product and is happy with it. Hot Off The Press is my favorite product I own because it makes styling my hair so easy, and lasting. I want every girl to have it on hand to make life better!

I have a couple questions. How does it smell? I prefer hair products that leave my hair smelling as great as it looks. Also when you spray and comb through before applying heat does it make the hair wet enough to be able to use pastel chalk on the hair or is this maybe not a great use of this particular product… if that’s the case do you have a different recommendation?


Reply 





Hot Off The Press has a nice smell but it can be a little “alcohol-ey” smelling.
If you spray each particular strand (like I do before curling) then it’s possible for it to be wet enough for that. If you are chalking your hair you can probably spray this on your full head of hair before applying the water and chalk. This way it will protect your hair before applying the heat that you need for chalking.

Hi  I have just bought this product.  Before you blow dry should I use a product on my hair, then use this before curling or straightening it?


Reply 





Melissa,
Yes! You have it correctly. Before blow drying, use a product like Milkshake Incredible Milk or Heat Protecting Spray.
Hot Off The Press does not work to use before blow drying since it is a hair spray too. 🙂

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
