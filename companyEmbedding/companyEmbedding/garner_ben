May has ushered in some consistently summer-y weather (finally!)—and since it also happens to be Skin Cancer Awareness month, now is the perfect time for a refresher course on safeguarding skin from the sun. Skin cancer affects 1 in 5 Americans, and there are more new cases every year than breast, prostate, and lung cancer combined.We sat down with Jennifer Garner whose glowing complexion is a true testament to diligent sun protection. As a spokesmodel for Neutrogena's Choose Skin Health Skin Care initiative, which promotes skin cancer education and offers free screenings in partnership with the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, Garner schooled us on self-screening, her trick to a sunless glow, husband Ben Affleck's own skincare habits, and her "scare 'em" parenting tactics:Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowRelated: The 9 Best New Sunscreens for Every Need
How do you protect your skin from the sun? I'm just boring about it. There's rarely a big hat. I think all those things are great but I'm boring in that I just use sunscreen every day. I don't mess around. I put it on first thing. I have it on now and I'm sitting inside.Do you put it on before you apply makeup?For sure. I usually don't wear makeup and if I do, it's later in the day, if I have to get my act together for work for some reason. If I don't have time to shower before I get kids out the door then I [put SPF on] then and I'll put it on after the shower again. So I just am diligent about it. That's all you can do.
Most PopularWhat do you look for in an SPF product?Because I have my hands on all of them—for my birthday Neutrogena sent me a box of sunscreen, all different sunscreens, and I was like, "la la la!"—I get to try them all out and I know them all very well. But I'm really into Ultra Sheer Dry Touch, SPF 45. And the reason is that it just disappears. You don't have that gross feeling.I use it! It's amazing.It's really good! But I also have the stick. I have all kinds of things to reapply and I let my kids choose from a whole bunch of different options.How about your husband? Is he into it too?Thank goodness he is not a spokesperson for Neutrogena because he is not the most careful when it comes to sunscreen.Do you use self-tanners and bronzers for a sunless glow?I am not above either. I can definitely benefit from a self-tan, although I cannot say that I am the best at applying it. I'm just not gifted at those kinds of things! But bronzer for sure. Also just using blush that has that kind of a sun-kissed color, as opposed to a bright pink. I would rather have it be really sheer and just right where the sun would hit you. When I was younger, everyone did Nike stripes.Like the old version of contouring!So bad!How do you take care of an accidental sunburn?Bite your tongue! I don't get a sunburn. When Ben gets a sunburn, I use some after-sun lotion and I, you know—Yell at him.[Laughs]Are there any other methods or tricks you use to make sure that your skin is protected?Really it's just about having [sunscreen] available when you think of it. So I always make sure that there's something. The sticks are really good because they don't leak, so it's having one of those sticks in my bag or having something in my car; having something by the back door, just making sure that it's around.How do you teach your kids about sun safety?It's just a non-negotiable. We talk about it, but it's more than talking, it's just doing. And they'll learn from the fact that it's always been done to them. I think they think that they would crumble into a pile of ash if they went outside without sunscreen because they've never done it. [Laughs]
Good! Gotta start 'em early.Yup, brainwash.Beyond SPF, what's your typical skincare routine like?I wash my face at night for sure. If I've had makeup on I wash it twice. And now that I'm old I use the Rapid Repair moisturizer, which has all the stuff in it—retinol, alpha, whatever, all of it. And I do use a Neutrogena eye cream, which I didn't used to. That's kind of it.What else do you do to take care of your complexion?Drink water, drink tea. I find that if I drink tea I can make myself think that it's something special, because you know how you just really want a glass of wine at the end of the day? So sometimes I can really want a glass of wine but talk myself into believing that tea is as nice, and that's one thing to do to be nice to your skin. Actually, two things: you're not have the wine and you're drinking water. Also just working out. All the things you do to be healthy in your life help your skin.What other advice have you picked up while working with Neutrogena?I will tell you that one bad sunburn as a child doubles your chance of getting skin cancer.  So I'm probably surprised I'm still sitting here. It's one of the most preventable cancers and still there are more new cases of skin cancer every year than lung, breast, prostate, and colon combined. How crazy is that? So get your little moles screened and don't think that you don't have to wear sunscreen just because you're young and pretty–you do. I'll tell you one more thing: When you turn 35 you will wake up and you will see the sun damage that you thought somehow wasn't going to affect you, so just do it. Just listen to me and you can write me a note then.For every SPF product purchased, Neutrogena will donate one product to a family in need. Yet another reason to stock up!More from ELLE:

MoviesBen Affleck Dating Saturday Night Live Producer Lindsay Shookus — and She's Staying at His L.A. House

Live from Los Angeles, it’s Ben Affleck and his new date!
The 44-year-old Oscar-winning actor-director is dating Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, PEOPLE confirms.
“They are spending time together in L.A. Lindsay is staying at Ben’s new house,” a source tells PEOPLE of the duo, who stepped out together in Los Angeles Thursday night. “They had dinner at Giorgio Baldi last night. They arrived in a limo. They looked happy. They had a quick dinner and then returned to Ben’s house.”

While reps for Affleck haven’t yet commented, sources tell PEOPLE that Affleck and Shookus, 37, have known one another for years and they had dinner in London last week while he was in town for work. E! reports they also stepped out together in London to see the play Ferryman.

Shookus was also photographed leaving Affleck’s L.A. home on June 8.
Affleck is a five-time Saturday Night Live host, and last hosted the show in May 2013.

Shookus, who was photographed at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday, got her start in the entertainment business when she was hired as an assistant to a producer on SNL in 2002. After climbing the ranks, the New York-native was eventually promoted to producer and even went on to work on Tina Fey’s 30 Rock.

She was previously married to fellow SNL colleague Kevin Miller. The two married in 2010 and have one child together.
The apparent budding romance comes three months after Affleck and his estranged wife Jennifer Garner officially filed for divorce.
The former couple — who share three kids together, Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5 — first separated in 2015 after 10 years of marriage and remain close, making cooperative co-parenting a priority and even spending the Fourth of July as a family at a Los Angeles parade.
Before the holiday, the family also took a trip to the Bahamas together.

But as PEOPLE previously reported, Affleck has been dating again — and on Thursday night, he and Shookus were photographed together while stepping out for a dinner in L.A..
She wore ripped black jeans and a matching flower top, her blonde hair casually down. Affleck, meanwhile, wore blue jeans, grey blazer and a Rolling Stone T-shirt.
“It’s more than a summer fling,” an insider told E!. “They are having fun and care for each other.”

Since their split, both Affleck and Garner, 45, have praised one another for how they work together — with Garner telling Today in August that she and her ex are “great friends.”
“We’re doing our very best and we’re putting our kids first and that’s how we’re focusing on our day to day lives and we don’t know what the future’s going to hold, but each step that we take is one where we prioritize our children and everything else comes second,” Affleck told CBS This Morning in March 2016 — adding that Garner is “somebody that I admire and respect and remain excellent friends with.”
“They are working hard to continue to build a world that is right for their children,” a source previously told PEOPLE.

CelebrityBen Affleck and Jennifer Garner Divorcing After 10 Years of MarriageBy Michelle Tauber•@michelletauber and Elizabeth Leonard•@lizzleonard1Posted on June 30, 2015 at 4:30pm EDT 
ShareTweetEmail 





 



Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner have split, PEOPLE confirms.    
The couple were married for 10 years, having marked their anniversary on Monday.    
“After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce,” the couple tells PEOPLE in a joint statement. “We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter.  Thank you for understanding.”    
Garner, 43, and Affleck, 42, intend to seek mediation, says a source close to the couple.    
The two are parents to three kids: Violet, 9, Seraphina, 6, and Samuel, 3.  
The couple often enjoyed family time together at home in Los Angeles where they were frequently spotted on carpool, coffee and after-school activity outings with their brood.  
But their marriage was also the subject of scrutiny over the years.    
In a 2014 interview with InStyle, Garner spoke of the couple’s “mindful” marriage, noting that their relationship was no longer in the “courtship” phase – but that she was fine with it.  
“You can’t expect to be courted all the time, and I don’t want to court him right now – I don’t have the energy!  
“But we’re definitely in a very mindful place where we’re making an effort to be together, do things at the same time, and be loving.”  
Affleck often spoke of how much Garner helped stabilize his life after it had become tabloid fodder in the years following his 2004 split with Jennifer Lopez.  
“My wife was definitely around then,” Affleck told Playboy in 2013. “Getting to know her, falling in love with her and being connected with her gave me a foundation to reach out and say, ‘Okay, I’m going to do Hollywoodland. I’m going to direct Gone Baby Gone,’ ” Affleck said. “Those were the steps forward I needed to put positive stuff on the board.”  
Garner returned the praise, telling InStyle in 2013, “We both know we couldn’t do what we do without each other. He has been amazing at finding ways of telling me how much he appreciates what I do. Honestly, I would do anything for that man, because I know it’s not to be taken for granted.   
The two first met as costars on the the set of 2001’s Pearl Harbor, then reconnected making their 2003 film Daredevil and started dating soon afterward.

Early life[edit]
Jennifer Garner was born on April 17, 1972 in Houston, Texas but moved to Charleston, West Virginia at the age of three.[2] Her father, William John Garner, worked as a chemical engineer for Union Carbide and her mother, Patricia Ann (née English), was a homemaker and, later, an English teacher at a local college.[3][4] She has an older sister, Melissa Wylie, and a younger sister, Susannah Carpenter. Garner has described herself as a typical middle child who sought to differentiate herself from her accomplished older sister.[5][6] While Garner did not grow up in a politically active household,[7] her father was "very conservative" and her mother "quietly blue."[8] She attended a local United Methodist Church every Sunday and went to Vacation Bible School.[9] As teenagers, Garner and her sisters were not allowed to wear makeup, paint their nails, pierce their ears or dye their hair;[10][11] she has joked that her family's "take on the world" was "practically Amish."[12]
Garner attended George Washington High School in Charleston;[13] she played saxophone in the marching band and was water girl for the football team.[2][14] While Garner was not a bad student, she did not get "straight As" and instead wanted to perform "in any kind of production."[8] She participated in musicals at the local community theater, the Charleston Light Opera Guild,[15] and took piano, singing and ballet lessons.[14][2] In 1990, Garner enrolled at Denison University in Granville, Ohio,[16] where she changed her major from chemistry to theater[17] and was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority.[18] She spent the fall semester of 1993 studying at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut.[19] In 1994, she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater performance.[20]
Acting career[edit]
1994–2001: Career beginnings and Alias[edit]
As a college student, Garner did summer stock theater. In addition to performing, Garner helped to sell tickets, build sets, and clean the venues.[21] She worked at the Timber Lake Playhouse in Mount Carroll, Illinois in 1992,[22] the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan in 1993,[23] and the Georgia Shakespeare Festival in Atlanta, Georgia in 1994.[24] Garner moved to New York City in 1995.[25] During her first year in the city, Garner earned $150 per week as an understudy for a Roundabout Theatre Company production of A Month in the Country, starring Helen Mirren and F. Murray Abraham,[6][26] and made her first on-screen appearance as Melissa Gilbert's daughter in the romance miniseries Zoya.[27] In 1996, she played an Amish woman in the television movie Harvest of Fire[28] and a flirtatious shopkeeper in the Western miniseries Dead Man's Walk.[29] She appeared in the independent short film In Harm's Way[30] and made one-off appearances in the legal dramas Swift Justice and Law & Order. She met Stephen Colbert while filming an episode of Spin City and became an occasional babysitter for his children.[31] Garner also supplemented her income by working as a hostess at Isabella's restaurant on the Upper East Side.[32]
After moving to Los Angeles in 1997, Garner won her first leading role in the television movie Rose Hill[33] and made her first feature film appearance in the period drama Washington Square.[34] She appeared in the comedy movie Mr. Magoo, the independent drama 1999 and Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry; most of her performance was cut from Allen's film.[35] In 1998, Garner appeared in an episode of Fantasy Island and was cast as a series regular in the Fox drama Significant Others. Will Joyner of The New York Times praised her ability to "provide the leavening ingredient of innocent insight"[36] but Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly felt there was no center to the character, as played by Garner.[37] Fox cancelled the series after airing three of six filmed episodes. Garner's most significant role of 1998 was in J.J. Abrams' college drama Felicity. During a two-episode guest appearance, she befriended Abrams and met her first husband Scott Foley.[38] In 1999, Garner was cast as a series regular in another Fox drama, Time of Your Life, but it was cancelled midway through the first season.[39] Also in 1999, she appeared in the miniseries Aftershock: Earthquake in New York and in two episodes of the action drama The Pretender. Garner played the girlfriend of Ashton Kutcher's character in the comedy Dude, Where's My Car? (2000). In 2001, she appeared briefly opposite her husband Foley in the drama Stealing Time and had a small role as a nurse in the war epic Pearl Harbor.[40]
Garner rose to fame in 2001 when she was cast as the star of the ABC spy drama Alias.[3] The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: "I always thought she had something in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that."[38] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role.[41] Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: "You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross."[42] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought "an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness" to the role.[43] Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end.[44] During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.
2002–11: Transition to film[edit]
While Alias was airing, Garner continued to work in film intermittently. She had an "other-worldly" experience when Steven Spielberg called to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in Catch Me if You Can (2002).[45] After seeing her in Alias, Speilberg felt sure "she would be the next superstar".[46] She filmed her scene opposite Leonardo DiCaprio during a one-day shoot.[47] Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action movie Daredevil (2003), in which she played Elektra to Ben Affleck's Daredevil.[48] The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered "an aptitude for" while working on Alias.[45][49] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said she "realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines. She hasn't mastered the combat skill of tossing off bad material."[50] While Daredevil received mixed reviews, it was a box office success.[51] Also in 2003, Garner voiced herself in an episode of The Simpsons.
Garner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy 13 Going on 30 (2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a 30-year old. Garner chose Gary Winick to direct the film[52] and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011.[53][54] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found her "startling": "Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else."[55] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised an "utterly beguiling" performance: "You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star."[56] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post remarked: "Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for."[57] 13 Going on 30 was a moderate commercial success.[58] Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005 Daredevil spin-off Elektra; it was a box office and critical failure.[59] Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded that Garner "is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in 13 Going on 30.[60] Garner next starred opposite Timothy Olyphant in the romantic drama Catch and Release. Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons of Alias, it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget.[61] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Garner's ability "to blend charm and gravity"[62] but Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that, while her "natural beauty and likability are still assets, [she] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role."[63]
After a one-year break following the conclusion of Alias, her wedding to Affleck, and the birth of her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in Juno as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of New York Magazine as a turning point in her career: "She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman expertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card."[64] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said she had never "been lovelier or more affecting."[65] She played an FBI investigator in the action thriller The Kingdom (2007).[66][67] She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke.[68] In late 2007 and early 2008, Garner played Roxanne to Kevin Kline's Cyrano de Bergerac at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons.[26] Ben Brantley of The New York Times described her performance as "captivating": " Ms. Garner, I am pleased to report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... [She] speaks Anthony Burgess’s peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she’s a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable."[69] The New Yorker's theater critic was impressed by her "feistiness" and " lightness of comic touch".[70] The play was recorded before a live audience and aired on PBS in 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.[71]




Garner in 2009 at a press conference for The Invention of Lying


Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first appeared opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. While Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune found Garner "easy to like and sharp with her timing", he was disappointed to see her as "the love interest, which is not the same as a rounded character."[72] Similarly, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was dismayed to see the actress appear as "less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words “enter generic female lead” in [the] screenplay)."[73] Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner - "always happy and always pleasant to everyone" - against type.[74] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she "proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on."[75] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised an "inspired, seemingly effortless, performance"[76] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before."[77] Garner then appeared in Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day (2010), sharing scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey.[78] In 2011, she had a supporting role in Arthur as the villainous arranged bride of Russell Brand's character.[79][80]
2012–present[edit]




Garner at the premiere of Butter in 2011


Garner played a mother for the first time in 2012,[5] starring opposite Joel Edgerton in the drama The Odd Life of Timothy Green.[81] It received mixed reviews from critics and was a modest commercial success.[82][83] Claudia Puig of USA Today found her "convincing as a warm-hearted, if tense, mom"[84] while Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said she brought "fervent sincerity and a welcome touch of comic eccentricity" to the role.[85] Also in 2012, Garner starred in the satirical comedy Butter, which received mixed feedback from critics and poor earnings at the box office.[86][87] Peter Debruge of Variety praised "the best bigscreen use of Jennifer Garner’s comedy gifts since 13 Going on 30”[88] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as the "best in show" : "[She] knows how to play comedy of the absurd."[89] However, Scott Bowles of USA Today remarked: "Garner is a terrific actress, but here she's asked to cackle her lines in a voice a full octave above her natural one."[90] Also in 2012, she appeared opposite Alfred Molina in the YouTube short Serena.[91] Also in 2012, she became a spokesperson for food company Luvo.[92]
Garner reunited with Matthew McConaughey in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club, which received positive reviews and was a box office success.[93][94] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as "a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity"[95] while Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post remarked: "McConaughey and Leto may have the showiest roles, but Garner deserves equal praise for her sensitive, straightforward performance."[96] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said: "Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here."[97] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said: "It’s not a well-shaped role, but I’ve gotten to the point where I’m happy to see Garner in anything. She’s incapable of phoniness."[98] Also in 2013, she became the first celebrity spokesperson of Max Mara.[99]
In 2014, she starred opposte Kevin Costner in the sports drama Draft Day. Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle remarked: "It's not much of a role, but she's perfectly nice in it. Perhaps someday someone will give Garner a chance to be something other than perfectly nice."[100] Garner also co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2014 Disney adaptation of the popular children's book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. Sandie Angulo Chen of the Washington Post said: "Garner, who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms, is pleasantly frazzled."[101] Also in 2014, Garner appeared in Men, Women & Children. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said: "Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it’s not much. The role is like a caricature of her performance in Juno, minus the ultimate (and essential) redemption."[102] In late 2014, Capital One signed Garner as their spokeswoman for their Capital One Venture Air Miles credit card.[103] In 2015's Danny Collins, starring Al Pacino and Annette Bening, Garner had a supporting role as the wife of Bobby Cannavale's character. Stephanie Merry of the Washington Post felt she "gives the movie a powerful jolt of emotion."[104]
In 2016, Garner appeared in the Christian drama Miracles from Heaven. Ken Jaworowski of The New York Times praised a "dedicated" and "heartfelt" performance[105] while Nigel Smith of The Guardian found "her subtly wrought work ... tremendously effective" in an otherwise "crassly manipulative" film.[106] She starred opposite Kevin Spacey in the comedy Nine Lives. Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times jokingly asked Garner to "send us some kind of signal if you need help"[107] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said she was "stranded in a nothing role."[108] She also made an uncredited cameo appearance in Mother's Day.
Wakefield will be released in May 2017.[109] The Tribes of Palos Verdes, filmed in 2016, is awaiting a release date. In 2017, she will provide the voice of Mama Llama for Netflix’s new original animated preschool series Llama Llama while, in 2018, she will provide a voice for a character in Amusement Park. In early 2017, she filmed a role in Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda.[110] She has also filmed a role in friend Judy Greer's directorial debut A Happening of Monumental Proportions, set for release in 2017.[111][112]
Activism[edit]
Early childhood education[edit]

In 2009, Garner became an artist ambassador for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts.[113][114] Since 2014,[115] Garner has served on the board of trustees for Save the Children,[116][117] the United States branch of the British children's charity,[118] advocating for early education.[119] She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years.[120] In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children.[121] In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: "My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... I want her to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have to make the world a better place for everyone."[122] In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign.,[117] and in January 2015, she appeared in A Path Appears, a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.[123]
Other[edit]
In 2007, Garner said she was "not a particularly outwardly political person."[68] In 2002, Garner filmed a 30-second television advertisement for her childhood friend Corey Palumbo, running as a Democratic candidate for the West Virginia House of Delegates.[124] In 2006, Garner spoke at a rally in support of Democratic Congressional candidate Jerry McNerney in Pleasanton, California.[125] In 2008, she hosted two fundraisers for Obama during the 2008 Democratic Primary.[126][127] In 2014, Garner donated $25,000 to the campaign of Democratic politician Wendy Davis.[128] During the 2016 presidential campaign, Garner hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Bozeman, Montana[129] and attended voter registration and phone bank events for Clinton in Reno, Nevada.[130]
Garner has campaigned for laws to protect her children from paparazzi. "There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside our door every single day. My kids take karate for example, and we have our classes at the same time every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids."[131] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers.[132] The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.[133]
In 2007, she appeared in a global warming awareness video produced by the Center for American Progress Action Fund.[134]
Personal life[edit]
Relationships and family[edit]
Garner had a five-year relationship with Scott Foley. They met on the set of Felicity in 1998.[3] They married in a ceremony at their home on October 19, 2000 and separated in March 2003.[135] Garner filed for divorce in May 2003, citing irreconcilable differences, and divorce papers were granted in March 2004.[136] Garner later described it as "a crushing experience. I thought the divorce statistics would never apply to me ... I wanted to be married for as long as my parents."[137][138] She dated her Alias co-star Michael Vartan from August 2003 to mid-2004.[139][140]




Garner with husband Ben Affleck at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards


Garner began dating Ben Affleck in mid-2004,[141] having established a friendship on the sets of Pearl Harbor (2001) and Daredevil (2003).[142] They were married on June 29, 2005, in a private Turks and Caicos ceremony.[143] Victor Garber, who officiated the ceremony, and his husband Rainer Andreesen were the only guests.[144] Garner and Affleck have three children: daughters Violet Anne (b. December 2005)[145] and Seraphina "Sera" Rose Elizabeth (b. January 2009),[146] and son Samuel "Sam" Garner (b. February 2012).[147] They announced their intention to divorce in June 2015,[148] and jointly filed legal documents in April 2017, seeking joint physical and legal custody of their children.[149]
Religion[edit]
Although Garner stopped attending church regularly after moving to Los Angeles,[150] each of her three children were baptised as members of the United Methodist Church in her hometown of Charleston, West Virginia.[151] In 2015, she and her family began attending weekly Methodist church services in Los Angeles.[151]
Stalking incident[edit]
Garner was stalked by Steven Burky from 2002 to 2003, and again from 2008 to 2009. She, her husband, and her daughter Violet obtained a restraining order in 2008.[152] Burky was arrested in December 2009 outside her daughter's preschool.[153] He was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. In March 2010, he was ruled insane, sent to California's state mental hospital, and ordered to stay away from the Affleck family for 10 years if released from hospital.[154]

Early life[edit]
Jennifer Garner was born on April 17, 1972 in Houston, Texas but moved to Charleston, West Virginia at the age of three.[2] Her father, William John Garner, worked as a chemical engineer for Union Carbide and her mother, Patricia Ann (née English), was a homemaker and, later, an English teacher at a local college.[3][4] She has an older sister, Melissa Wylie, and a younger sister, Susannah Carpenter. Garner has described herself as a typical middle child who sought to differentiate herself from her accomplished older sister.[5][6] While Garner did not grow up in a politically active household,[7] her father was "very conservative" and her mother "quietly blue."[8] She attended a local United Methodist Church every Sunday and went to Vacation Bible School.[9] As teenagers, Garner and her sisters were not allowed to wear makeup, paint their nails, pierce their ears or dye their hair;[10][11] she has joked that her family's "take on the world" was "practically Amish."[12]
Garner attended George Washington High School in Charleston;[13] she played saxophone in the marching band and was water girl for the football team.[2][14] While Garner was not a bad student, she did not get "straight As" and instead wanted to perform "in any kind of production."[8] She participated in musicals at the local community theater, the Charleston Light Opera Guild,[15] and took piano, singing and ballet lessons.[14][2] In 1990, Garner enrolled at Denison University in Granville, Ohio,[16] where she changed her major from chemistry to theater[17] and was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority.[18] She spent the fall semester of 1993 studying at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut.[19] In 1994, she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater performance.[20]
Acting career[edit]
1994–2001: Career beginnings and Alias[edit]
As a college student, Garner did summer stock theater. In addition to performing, Garner helped to sell tickets, build sets, and clean the venues.[21] She worked at the Timber Lake Playhouse in Mount Carroll, Illinois in 1992,[22] the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan in 1993,[23] and the Georgia Shakespeare Festival in Atlanta, Georgia in 1994.[24] Garner moved to New York City in 1995.[25] During her first year in the city, Garner earned $150 per week as an understudy for a Roundabout Theatre Company production of A Month in the Country, starring Helen Mirren and F. Murray Abraham,[6][26] and made her first on-screen appearance as Melissa Gilbert's daughter in the romance miniseries Zoya.[27] In 1996, she played an Amish woman in the television movie Harvest of Fire[28] and a flirtatious shopkeeper in the Western miniseries Dead Man's Walk.[29] She appeared in the independent short film In Harm's Way[30] and made one-off appearances in the legal dramas Swift Justice and Law & Order. She met Stephen Colbert while filming an episode of Spin City and became an occasional babysitter for his children.[31] Garner also supplemented her income by working as a hostess at Isabella's restaurant on the Upper East Side.[32]
After moving to Los Angeles in 1997, Garner won her first leading role in the television movie Rose Hill[33] and made her first feature film appearance in the period drama Washington Square.[34] She appeared in the comedy movie Mr. Magoo, the independent drama 1999 and Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry; most of her performance was cut from Allen's film.[35] In 1998, Garner appeared in an episode of Fantasy Island and was cast as a series regular in the Fox drama Significant Others. Will Joyner of The New York Times praised her ability to "provide the leavening ingredient of innocent insight"[36] but Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly felt there was no center to the character, as played by Garner.[37] Fox cancelled the series after airing three of six filmed episodes. Garner's most significant role of 1998 was in J.J. Abrams' college drama Felicity. During a two-episode guest appearance, she befriended Abrams and met her first husband Scott Foley.[38] In 1999, Garner was cast as a series regular in another Fox drama, Time of Your Life, but it was cancelled midway through the first season.[39] Also in 1999, she appeared in the miniseries Aftershock: Earthquake in New York and in two episodes of the action drama The Pretender. Garner played the girlfriend of Ashton Kutcher's character in the comedy Dude, Where's My Car? (2000). In 2001, she appeared briefly opposite her husband Foley in the drama Stealing Time and had a small role as a nurse in the war epic Pearl Harbor.[40]
Garner rose to fame in 2001 when she was cast as the star of the ABC spy drama Alias.[3] The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: "I always thought she had something in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that."[38] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role.[41] Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: "You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross."[42] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought "an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness" to the role.[43] Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end.[44] During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.
2002–11: Transition to film[edit]
While Alias was airing, Garner continued to work in film intermittently. She had an "other-worldly" experience when Steven Spielberg called to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in Catch Me if You Can (2002).[45] After seeing her in Alias, Speilberg felt sure "she would be the next superstar".[46] She filmed her scene opposite Leonardo DiCaprio during a one-day shoot.[47] Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action movie Daredevil (2003), in which she played Elektra to Ben Affleck's Daredevil.[48] The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered "an aptitude for" while working on Alias.[45][49] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said she "realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines. She hasn't mastered the combat skill of tossing off bad material."[50] While Daredevil received mixed reviews, it was a box office success.[51] Also in 2003, Garner voiced herself in an episode of The Simpsons.
Garner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy 13 Going on 30 (2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a 30-year old. Garner chose Gary Winick to direct the film[52] and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011.[53][54] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found her "startling": "Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else."[55] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised an "utterly beguiling" performance: "You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star."[56] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post remarked: "Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for."[57] 13 Going on 30 was a moderate commercial success.[58] Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005 Daredevil spin-off Elektra; it was a box office and critical failure.[59] Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded that Garner "is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in 13 Going on 30.[60] Garner next starred opposite Timothy Olyphant in the romantic drama Catch and Release. Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons of Alias, it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget.[61] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Garner's ability "to blend charm and gravity"[62] but Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that, while her "natural beauty and likability are still assets, [she] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role."[63]
After a one-year break following the conclusion of Alias, her wedding to Affleck, and the birth of her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in Juno as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of New York Magazine as a turning point in her career: "She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman expertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card."[64] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said she had never "been lovelier or more affecting."[65] She played an FBI investigator in the action thriller The Kingdom (2007).[66][67] She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke.[68] In late 2007 and early 2008, Garner played Roxanne to Kevin Kline's Cyrano de Bergerac at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons.[26] Ben Brantley of The New York Times described her performance as "captivating": " Ms. Garner, I am pleased to report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... [She] speaks Anthony Burgess’s peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she’s a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable."[69] The New Yorker's theater critic was impressed by her "feistiness" and " lightness of comic touch".[70] The play was recorded before a live audience and aired on PBS in 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.[71]




Garner in 2009 at a press conference for The Invention of Lying


Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first appeared opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. While Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune found Garner "easy to like and sharp with her timing", he was disappointed to see her as "the love interest, which is not the same as a rounded character."[72] Similarly, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was dismayed to see the actress appear as "less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words “enter generic female lead” in [the] screenplay)."[73] Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner - "always happy and always pleasant to everyone" - against type.[74] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she "proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on."[75] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised an "inspired, seemingly effortless, performance"[76] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before."[77] Garner then appeared in Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day (2010), sharing scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey.[78] In 2011, she had a supporting role in Arthur as the villainous arranged bride of Russell Brand's character.[79][80]
2012–present[edit]




Garner at the premiere of Butter in 2011


Garner played a mother for the first time in 2012,[5] starring opposite Joel Edgerton in the drama The Odd Life of Timothy Green.[81] It received mixed reviews from critics and was a modest commercial success.[82][83] Claudia Puig of USA Today found her "convincing as a warm-hearted, if tense, mom"[84] while Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said she brought "fervent sincerity and a welcome touch of comic eccentricity" to the role.[85] Also in 2012, Garner starred in the satirical comedy Butter, which received mixed feedback from critics and poor earnings at the box office.[86][87] Peter Debruge of Variety praised "the best bigscreen use of Jennifer Garner’s comedy gifts since 13 Going on 30”[88] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as the "best in show" : "[She] knows how to play comedy of the absurd."[89] However, Scott Bowles of USA Today remarked: "Garner is a terrific actress, but here she's asked to cackle her lines in a voice a full octave above her natural one."[90] Also in 2012, she appeared opposite Alfred Molina in the YouTube short Serena.[91] Also in 2012, she became a spokesperson for food company Luvo.[92]
Garner reunited with Matthew McConaughey in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club, which received positive reviews and was a box office success.[93][94] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as "a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity"[95] while Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post remarked: "McConaughey and Leto may have the showiest roles, but Garner deserves equal praise for her sensitive, straightforward performance."[96] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said: "Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here."[97] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said: "It’s not a well-shaped role, but I’ve gotten to the point where I’m happy to see Garner in anything. She’s incapable of phoniness."[98] Also in 2013, she became the first celebrity spokesperson of Max Mara.[99]
In 2014, she starred opposte Kevin Costner in the sports drama Draft Day. Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle remarked: "It's not much of a role, but she's perfectly nice in it. Perhaps someday someone will give Garner a chance to be something other than perfectly nice."[100] Garner also co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2014 Disney adaptation of the popular children's book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. Sandie Angulo Chen of the Washington Post said: "Garner, who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms, is pleasantly frazzled."[101] Also in 2014, Garner appeared in Men, Women & Children. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said: "Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it’s not much. The role is like a caricature of her performance in Juno, minus the ultimate (and essential) redemption."[102] In late 2014, Capital One signed Garner as their spokeswoman for their Capital One Venture Air Miles credit card.[103] In 2015's Danny Collins, starring Al Pacino and Annette Bening, Garner had a supporting role as the wife of Bobby Cannavale's character. Stephanie Merry of the Washington Post felt she "gives the movie a powerful jolt of emotion."[104]
In 2016, Garner appeared in the Christian drama Miracles from Heaven. Ken Jaworowski of The New York Times praised a "dedicated" and "heartfelt" performance[105] while Nigel Smith of The Guardian found "her subtly wrought work ... tremendously effective" in an otherwise "crassly manipulative" film.[106] She starred opposite Kevin Spacey in the comedy Nine Lives. Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times jokingly asked Garner to "send us some kind of signal if you need help"[107] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said she was "stranded in a nothing role."[108] She also made an uncredited cameo appearance in Mother's Day.
Wakefield will be released in May 2017.[109] The Tribes of Palos Verdes, filmed in 2016, is awaiting a release date. In 2017, she will provide the voice of Mama Llama for Netflix’s new original animated preschool series Llama Llama while, in 2018, she will provide a voice for a character in Amusement Park. In early 2017, she filmed a role in Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda.[110] She has also filmed a role in friend Judy Greer's directorial debut A Happening of Monumental Proportions, set for release in 2017.[111][112]
Activism[edit]
Early childhood education[edit]




Garner with a preschooler at a Capitol Hill event in 2013


In 2009, Garner became an artist ambassador for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts.[113][114] Since 2014,[115] Garner has served on the board of trustees for Save the Children,[116][117] the United States branch of the British children's charity,[118] advocating for early education.[119] She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years.[120] In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children.[121] In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: "My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... I want her to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have to make the world a better place for everyone."[122] In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign.,[117] and in January 2015, she appeared in A Path Appears, a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.[123]
Other[edit]
In 2007, Garner said she was "not a particularly outwardly political person."[68] In 2002, Garner filmed a 30-second television advertisement for her childhood friend Corey Palumbo, running as a Democratic candidate for the West Virginia House of Delegates.[124] In 2006, Garner spoke at a rally in support of Democratic Congressional candidate Jerry McNerney in Pleasanton, California.[125] In 2008, she hosted two fundraisers for Obama during the 2008 Democratic Primary.[126][127] In 2014, Garner donated $25,000 to the campaign of Democratic politician Wendy Davis.[128] During the 2016 presidential campaign, Garner hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Bozeman, Montana[129] and attended voter registration and phone bank events for Clinton in Reno, Nevada.[130]
Garner has campaigned for laws to protect her children from paparazzi. "There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside our door every single day. My kids take karate for example, and we have our classes at the same time every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids."[131] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers.[132] The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.[133]
In 2007, she appeared in a global warming awareness video produced by the Center for American Progress Action Fund.[134]
Personal life[edit]
Relationships and family[edit]
Garner had a five-year relationship with Scott Foley. They met on the set of Felicity in 1998.[3] They married in a ceremony at their home on October 19, 2000 and separated in March 2003.[135] Garner filed for divorce in May 2003, citing irreconcilable differences, and divorce papers were granted in March 2004.[136] Garner later described it as "a crushing experience. I thought the divorce statistics would never apply to me ... I wanted to be married for as long as my parents."[137][138] She dated her Alias co-star Michael Vartan from August 2003 to mid-2004.[139][140]




Garner with husband Ben Affleck at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards


Garner began dating Ben Affleck in mid-2004,[141] having established a friendship on the sets of Pearl Harbor (2001) and Daredevil (2003).[142] They were married on June 29, 2005, in a private Turks and Caicos ceremony.[143] Victor Garber, who officiated the ceremony, and his husband Rainer Andreesen were the only guests.[144] Garner and Affleck have three children: daughters Violet Anne (b. December 2005)[145] and Seraphina "Sera" Rose Elizabeth (b. January 2009),[146] and son Samuel "Sam" Garner (b. February 2012).[147] They announced their intention to divorce in June 2015,[148] and jointly filed legal documents in April 2017, seeking joint physical and legal custody of their children.[149]
Religion[edit]
Although Garner stopped attending church regularly after moving to Los Angeles,[150] each of her three children were baptised as members of the United Methodist Church in her hometown of Charleston, West Virginia.[151] In 2015, she and her family began attending weekly Methodist church services in Los Angeles.[151]
Stalking incident[edit]
Garner was stalked by Steven Burky from 2002 to 2003, and again from 2008 to 2009. She, her husband, and her daughter Violet obtained a restraining order in 2008.[152] Burky was arrested in December 2009 outside her daughter's preschool.[153] He was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. In March 2010, he was ruled insane, sent to California's state mental hospital, and ordered to stay away from the Affleck family for 10 years if released from hospital.[154]

Jennifer Anne Garner (born April 17, 1972)[1] is an American actress. Her breakthrough film debut was in the comedy Dude, Where's My Car (2000). Following a supporting role in Pearl Harbor (2001), Garner gained recognition for her performance as CIA officer Sydney Bristow in the ABC spy-action thriller Alias, which aired from 2001 to 2006. For her work on the series, she won a Golden Globe Award and a SAG Award and received four Emmy Award nominations.
While working on Alias, Garner gained a cameo role in Catch Me if You Can (2002), followed by a praised leading performance in the romantic comedy film 13 Going on 30 (2004). Garner has appeared in supporting as well as lead film roles including the superhero films Daredevil (2003) and Elektra (2005), the comedy-drama Juno (2007), and the fantasy romantic comedy The Invention of Lying (2009). In the 2010s, she appeared in the romantic-comedy Valentine's Day (2010), the fantasy comedy-drama The Odd Life of Timothy Green (2012), the biographical drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), the comedy Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (2014), and the drama Miracles from Heaven (2016).
Garner works frequently as an activist for early childhood education and is a board member of Save the Children. She is also an advocate for anti-paparazzi campaigns among children of celebrities. Garner had a five-year relationship with Scott Foley from 1998 to 2003, during which they married. Garner married Ben Affleck in 2005, with whom she has three children.

Jennifer Garner was born on April 17, 1972 in Houston, Texas but moved to Charleston, West Virginia at the age of three.[2] Her father, William John Garner, worked as a chemical engineer for Union Carbide and her mother, Patricia Ann (née English), was a homemaker and, later, an English teacher at a local college.[3][4] She has an older sister, Melissa Wylie, and a younger sister, Susannah Carpenter. Garner has described herself as a typical middle child who sought to differentiate herself from her accomplished older sister.[5][6] While Garner did not grow up in a politically active household,[7] her father was "very conservative" and her mother "quietly blue."[8] She attended a local United Methodist Church every Sunday and went to Vacation Bible School.[9] As teenagers, Garner and her sisters were not allowed to wear makeup, paint their nails, pierce their ears or dye their hair;[10][11] she has joked that her family's "take on the world" was "practically Amish."[12]
Garner attended George Washington High School in Charleston;[13] she played saxophone in the marching band and was water girl for the football team.[2][14] While Garner was not a bad student, she did not get "straight As" and instead wanted to perform "in any kind of production."[8] She participated in musicals at the local community theater, the Charleston Light Opera Guild,[15] and took piano, singing and ballet lessons.[14][2] In 1990, Garner enrolled at Denison University in Granville, Ohio,[16] where she changed her major from chemistry to theater[17] and was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority.[18] She spent the fall semester of 1993 studying at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut.[19] In 1994, she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater performance.[20]
Acting career[edit]
1994–2001: Career beginnings and Alias[edit]
As a college student, Garner did summer stock theater. In addition to performing, Garner helped to sell tickets, build sets, and clean the venues.[21] She worked at the Timber Lake Playhouse in Mount Carroll, Illinois in 1992,[22] the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan in 1993,[23] and the Georgia Shakespeare Festival in Atlanta, Georgia in 1994.[24] Garner moved to New York City in 1995.[25] During her first year in the city, Garner earned $150 per week as an understudy for a Roundabout Theatre Company production of A Month in the Country, starring Helen Mirren and F. Murray Abraham,[6][26] and made her first on-screen appearance as Melissa Gilbert's daughter in the romance miniseries Zoya.[27] In 1996, she played an Amish woman in the television movie Harvest of Fire[28] and a flirtatious shopkeeper in the Western miniseries Dead Man's Walk.[29] She appeared in the independent short film In Harm's Way[30] and made one-off appearances in the legal dramas Swift Justice and Law & Order. She met Stephen Colbert while filming an episode of Spin City and became an occasional babysitter for his children.[31] Garner also supplemented her income by working as a hostess at Isabella's restaurant on the Upper East Side.[32]
After moving to Los Angeles in 1997, Garner won her first leading role in the television movie Rose Hill[33] and made her first feature film appearance in the period drama Washington Square.[34] She appeared in the comedy movie Mr. Magoo, the independent drama 1999 and Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry; most of her performance was cut from Allen's film.[35] In 1998, Garner appeared in an episode of Fantasy Island and was cast as a series regular in the Fox drama Significant Others. Will Joyner of The New York Times praised her ability to "provide the leavening ingredient of innocent insight"[36] but Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly felt there was no center to the character, as played by Garner.[37] Fox cancelled the series after airing three of six filmed episodes. Garner's most significant role of 1998 was in J.J. Abrams' college drama Felicity. During a two-episode guest appearance, she befriended Abrams and met her first husband Scott Foley.[38] In 1999, Garner was cast as a series regular in another Fox drama, Time of Your Life, but it was cancelled midway through the first season.[39] Also in 1999, she appeared in the miniseries Aftershock: Earthquake in New York and in two episodes of the action drama The Pretender. Garner played the girlfriend of Ashton Kutcher's character in the comedy Dude, Where's My Car? (2000). In 2001, she appeared briefly opposite her husband Foley in the drama Stealing Time and had a small role as a nurse in the war epic Pearl Harbor.[40]
Garner rose to fame in 2001 when she was cast as the star of the ABC spy drama Alias.[3] The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: "I always thought she had something in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that."[38] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role.[41] Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: "You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross."[42] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought "an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness" to the role.[43] Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end.[44] During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.
2002–11: Transition to film[edit]
While Alias was airing, Garner continued to work in film intermittently. She had an "other-worldly" experience when Steven Spielberg called to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in Catch Me if You Can (2002).[45] After seeing her in Alias, Speilberg felt sure "she would be the next superstar".[46] She filmed her scene opposite Leonardo DiCaprio during a one-day shoot.[47] Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action movie Daredevil (2003), in which she played Elektra to Ben Affleck's Daredevil.[48] The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered "an aptitude for" while working on Alias.[45][49] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said she "realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines. She hasn't mastered the combat skill of tossing off bad material."[50] While Daredevil received mixed reviews, it was a box office success.[51] Also in 2003, Garner voiced herself in an episode of The Simpsons.
Garner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy 13 Going on 30 (2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a 30-year old. Garner chose Gary Winick to direct the film[52] and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011.[53][54] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found her "startling": "Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else."[55] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised an "utterly beguiling" performance: "You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star."[56] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post remarked: "Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for."[57] 13 Going on 30 was a moderate commercial success.[58] Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005 Daredevil spin-off Elektra; it was a box office and critical failure.[59] Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded that Garner "is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in 13 Going on 30.[60] Garner next starred opposite Timothy Olyphant in the romantic drama Catch and Release. Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons of Alias, it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget.[61] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Garner's ability "to blend charm and gravity"[62] but Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that, while her "natural beauty and likability are still assets, [she] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role."[63]
After a one-year break following the conclusion of Alias, her wedding to Affleck, and the birth of her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in Juno as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of New York Magazine as a turning point in her career: "She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman expertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card."[64] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said she had never "been lovelier or more affecting."[65] She played an FBI investigator in the action thriller The Kingdom (2007).[66][67] She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke.[68] In late 2007 and early 2008, Garner played Roxanne to Kevin Kline's Cyrano de Bergerac at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons.[26] Ben Brantley of The New York Times described her performance as "captivating": " Ms. Garner, I am pleased to report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... [She] speaks Anthony Burgess’s peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she’s a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable."[69] The New Yorker's theater critic was impressed by her "feistiness" and " lightness of comic touch".[70] The play was recorded before a live audience and aired on PBS in 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.[71]




Garner in 2009 at a press conference for The Invention of Lying


Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first appeared opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. While Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune found Garner "easy to like and sharp with her timing", he was disappointed to see her as "the love interest, which is not the same as a rounded character."[72] Similarly, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was dismayed to see the actress appear as "less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words “enter generic female lead” in [the] screenplay)."[73] Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner - "always happy and always pleasant to everyone" - against type.[74] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she "proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on."[75] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised an "inspired, seemingly effortless, performance"[76] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before."[77] Garner then appeared in Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day (2010), sharing scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey.[78] In 2011, she had a supporting role in Arthur as the villainous arranged bride of Russell Brand's character.[79][80]
2012–present[edit]




Garner at the premiere of Butter in 2011


Garner played a mother for the first time in 2012,[5] starring opposite Joel Edgerton in the drama The Odd Life of Timothy Green.[81] It received mixed reviews from critics and was a modest commercial success.[82][83] Claudia Puig of USA Today found her "convincing as a warm-hearted, if tense, mom"[84] while Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said she brought "fervent sincerity and a welcome touch of comic eccentricity" to the role.[85] Also in 2012, Garner starred in the satirical comedy Butter, which received mixed feedback from critics and poor earnings at the box office.[86][87] Peter Debruge of Variety praised "the best bigscreen use of Jennifer Garner’s comedy gifts since 13 Going on 30”[88] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as the "best in show" : "[She] knows how to play comedy of the absurd."[89] However, Scott Bowles of USA Today remarked: "Garner is a terrific actress, but here she's asked to cackle her lines in a voice a full octave above her natural one."[90] Also in 2012, she appeared opposite Alfred Molina in the YouTube short Serena.[91] Also in 2012, she became a spokesperson for food company Luvo.[92]
Garner reunited with Matthew McConaughey in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club, which received positive reviews and was a box office success.[93][94] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as "a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity"[95] while Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post remarked: "McConaughey and Leto may have the showiest roles, but Garner deserves equal praise for her sensitive, straightforward performance."[96] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said: "Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here."[97] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said: "It’s not a well-shaped role, but I’ve gotten to the point where I’m happy to see Garner in anything. She’s incapable of phoniness."[98] Also in 2013, she became the first celebrity spokesperson of Max Mara.[99]
In 2014, she starred opposte Kevin Costner in the sports drama Draft Day. Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle remarked: "It's not much of a role, but she's perfectly nice in it. Perhaps someday someone will give Garner a chance to be something other than perfectly nice."[100] Garner also co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2014 Disney adaptation of the popular children's book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. Sandie Angulo Chen of the Washington Post said: "Garner, who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms, is pleasantly frazzled."[101] Also in 2014, Garner appeared in Men, Women & Children. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said: "Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it’s not much. The role is like a caricature of her performance in Juno, minus the ultimate (and essential) redemption."[102] In late 2014, Capital One signed Garner as their spokeswoman for their Capital One Venture Air Miles credit card.[103] In 2015's Danny Collins, starring Al Pacino and Annette Bening, Garner had a supporting role as the wife of Bobby Cannavale's character. Stephanie Merry of the Washington Post felt she "gives the movie a powerful jolt of emotion."[104]
In 2016, Garner appeared in the Christian drama Miracles from Heaven. Ken Jaworowski of The New York Times praised a "dedicated" and "heartfelt" performance[105] while Nigel Smith of The Guardian found "her subtly wrought work ... tremendously effective" in an otherwise "crassly manipulative" film.[106] She starred opposite Kevin Spacey in the comedy Nine Lives. Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times jokingly asked Garner to "send us some kind of signal if you need help"[107] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said she was "stranded in a nothing role."[108] She also made an uncredited cameo appearance in Mother's Day.
Wakefield will be released in May 2017.[109] The Tribes of Palos Verdes, filmed in 2016, is awaiting a release date. In 2017, she will provide the voice of Mama Llama for Netflix’s new original animated preschool series Llama Llama while, in 2018, she will provide a voice for a character in Amusement Park. In early 2017, she filmed a role in Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda.[110] She has also filmed a role in friend Judy Greer's directorial debut A Happening of Monumental Proportions, set for release in 2017.[111][112]
Activism[edit]
Early childhood education[edit]

In 2009, Garner became an artist ambassador for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts.[113][114] Since 2014,[115] Garner has served on the board of trustees for Save the Children,[116][117] the United States branch of the British children's charity,[118] advocating for early education.[119] She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years.[120] In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children.[121] In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: "My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... I want her to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have to make the world a better place for everyone."[122] In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign.,[117] and in January 2015, she appeared in A Path Appears, a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.[123]
Other[edit]
In 2007, Garner said she was "not a particularly outwardly political person."[68] In 2002, Garner filmed a 30-second television advertisement for her childhood friend Corey Palumbo, running as a Democratic candidate for the West Virginia House of Delegates.[124] In 2006, Garner spoke at a rally in support of Democratic Congressional candidate Jerry McNerney in Pleasanton, California.[125] In 2008, she hosted two fundraisers for Obama during the 2008 Democratic Primary.[126][127] In 2014, Garner donated $25,000 to the campaign of Democratic politician Wendy Davis.[128] During the 2016 presidential campaign, Garner hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Bozeman, Montana[129] and attended voter registration and phone bank events for Clinton in Reno, Nevada.[130]
Garner has campaigned for laws to protect her children from paparazzi. "There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside our door every single day. My kids take karate for example, and we have our classes at the same time every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids."[131] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers.[132] The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.[133]
In 2007, she appeared in a global warming awareness video produced by the Center for American Progress Action Fund.[134]
Personal life[edit]
Relationships and family[edit]
Garner had a five-year relationship with Scott Foley. They met on the set of Felicity in 1998.[3] They married in a ceremony at their home on October 19, 2000 and separated in March 2003.[135] Garner filed for divorce in May 2003, citing irreconcilable differences, and divorce papers were granted in March 2004.[136] Garner later described it as "a crushing experience. I thought the divorce statistics would never apply to me ... I wanted to be married for as long as my parents."[137][138] She dated her Alias co-star Michael Vartan from August 2003 to mid-2004.[139][140]




Garner with husband Ben Affleck at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards


Garner began dating Ben Affleck in mid-2004,[141] having established a friendship on the sets of Pearl Harbor (2001) and Daredevil (2003).[142] They were married on June 29, 2005, in a private Turks and Caicos ceremony.[143] Victor Garber, who officiated the ceremony, and his husband Rainer Andreesen were the only guests.[144] Garner and Affleck have three children: daughters Violet Anne (b. December 2005)[145] and Seraphina "Sera" Rose Elizabeth (b. January 2009),[146] and son Samuel "Sam" Garner (b. February 2012).[147] They announced their intention to divorce in June 2015,[148] and jointly filed legal documents in April 2017, seeking joint physical and legal custody of their children.[149]
Religion[edit]
Although Garner stopped attending church regularly after moving to Los Angeles,[150] each of her three children were baptised as members of the United Methodist Church in her hometown of Charleston, West Virginia.[151] In 2015, she and her family began attending weekly Methodist church services in Los Angeles.[151]
Stalking incident[edit]
Garner was stalked by Steven Burky from 2002 to 2003, and again from 2008 to 2009. She, her husband, and her daughter Violet obtained a restraining order in 2008.[152] Burky was arrested in December 2009 outside her daughter's preschool.[153] He was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. In March 2010, he was ruled insane, sent to California's state mental hospital, and ordered to stay away from the Affleck family for 10 years if released from hospital.[154]

Early life[edit]
Jennifer Garner was born on April 17, 1972 in Houston, Texas but moved to Charleston, West Virginia at the age of three.[2] Her father, William John Garner, worked as a chemical engineer for Union Carbide and her mother, Patricia Ann (née English), was a homemaker and, later, an English teacher at a local college.[3][4] She has an older sister, Melissa Wylie, and a younger sister, Susannah Carpenter. Garner has described herself as a typical middle child who sought to differentiate herself from her accomplished older sister.[5][6] While Garner did not grow up in a politically active household,[7] her father was "very conservative" and her mother "quietly blue."[8] She attended a local United Methodist Church every Sunday and went to Vacation Bible School.[9] As teenagers, Garner and her sisters were not allowed to wear makeup, paint their nails, pierce their ears or dye their hair;[10][11] she has joked that her family's "take on the world" was "practically Amish."[12]
Garner attended George Washington High School in Charleston;[13] she played saxophone in the marching band and was water girl for the football team.[2][14] While Garner was not a bad student, she did not get "straight As" and instead wanted to perform "in any kind of production."[8] She participated in musicals at the local community theater, the Charleston Light Opera Guild,[15] and took piano, singing and ballet lessons.[14][2] In 1990, Garner enrolled at Denison University in Granville, Ohio,[16] where she changed her major from chemistry to theater[17] and was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority.[18] She spent the fall semester of 1993 studying at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut.[19] In 1994, she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater performance.[20]
Acting career[edit]
1994–2001: Career beginnings and Alias[edit]
As a college student, Garner did summer stock theater. In addition to performing, Garner helped to sell tickets, build sets, and clean the venues.[21] She worked at the Timber Lake Playhouse in Mount Carroll, Illinois in 1992,[22] the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan in 1993,[23] and the Georgia Shakespeare Festival in Atlanta, Georgia in 1994.[24] Garner moved to New York City in 1995.[25] During her first year in the city, Garner earned $150 per week as an understudy for a Roundabout Theatre Company production of A Month in the Country, starring Helen Mirren and F. Murray Abraham,[6][26] and made her first on-screen appearance as Melissa Gilbert's daughter in the romance miniseries Zoya.[27] In 1996, she played an Amish woman in the television movie Harvest of Fire[28] and a flirtatious shopkeeper in the Western miniseries Dead Man's Walk.[29] She appeared in the independent short film In Harm's Way[30] and made one-off appearances in the legal dramas Swift Justice and Law & Order. She met Stephen Colbert while filming an episode of Spin City and became an occasional babysitter for his children.[31] Garner also supplemented her income by working as a hostess at Isabella's restaurant on the Upper East Side.[32]
After moving to Los Angeles in 1997, Garner won her first leading role in the television movie Rose Hill[33] and made her first feature film appearance in the period drama Washington Square.[34] She appeared in the comedy movie Mr. Magoo, the independent drama 1999 and Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry; most of her performance was cut from Allen's film.[35] In 1998, Garner appeared in an episode of Fantasy Island and was cast as a series regular in the Fox drama Significant Others. Will Joyner of The New York Times praised her ability to "provide the leavening ingredient of innocent insight"[36] but Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly felt there was no center to the character, as played by Garner.[37] Fox cancelled the series after airing three of six filmed episodes. Garner's most significant role of 1998 was in J.J. Abrams' college drama Felicity. During a two-episode guest appearance, she befriended Abrams and met her first husband Scott Foley.[38] In 1999, Garner was cast as a series regular in another Fox drama, Time of Your Life, but it was cancelled midway through the first season.[39] Also in 1999, she appeared in the miniseries Aftershock: Earthquake in New York and in two episodes of the action drama The Pretender. Garner played the girlfriend of Ashton Kutcher's character in the comedy Dude, Where's My Car? (2000). In 2001, she appeared briefly opposite her husband Foley in the drama Stealing Time and had a small role as a nurse in the war epic Pearl Harbor.[40]
Garner rose to fame in 2001 when she was cast as the star of the ABC spy drama Alias.[3] The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: "I always thought she had something in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that."[38] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role.[41] Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: "You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross."[42] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought "an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness" to the role.[43] Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end.[44] During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.
2002–11: Transition to film[edit]
While Alias was airing, Garner continued to work in film intermittently. She had an "other-worldly" experience when Steven Spielberg called to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in Catch Me if You Can (2002).[45] After seeing her in Alias, Speilberg felt sure "she would be the next superstar".[46] She filmed her scene opposite Leonardo DiCaprio during a one-day shoot.[47] Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action movie Daredevil (2003), in which she played Elektra to Ben Affleck's Daredevil.[48] The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered "an aptitude for" while working on Alias.[45][49] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said she "realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines. She hasn't mastered the combat skill of tossing off bad material."[50] While Daredevil received mixed reviews, it was a box office success.[51] Also in 2003, Garner voiced herself in an episode of The Simpsons.
Garner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy 13 Going on 30 (2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a 30-year old. Garner chose Gary Winick to direct the film[52] and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011.[53][54] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found her "startling": "Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else."[55] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised an "utterly beguiling" performance: "You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star."[56] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post remarked: "Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for."[57] 13 Going on 30 was a moderate commercial success.[58] Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005 Daredevil spin-off Elektra; it was a box office and critical failure.[59] Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded that Garner "is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in 13 Going on 30.[60] Garner next starred opposite Timothy Olyphant in the romantic drama Catch and Release. Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons of Alias, it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget.[61] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Garner's ability "to blend charm and gravity"[62] but Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that, while her "natural beauty and likability are still assets, [she] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role."[63]
After a one-year break following the conclusion of Alias, her wedding to Affleck, and the birth of her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in Juno as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of New York Magazine as a turning point in her career: "She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman expertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card."[64] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said she had never "been lovelier or more affecting."[65] She played an FBI investigator in the action thriller The Kingdom (2007).[66][67] She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke.[68] In late 2007 and early 2008, Garner played Roxanne to Kevin Kline's Cyrano de Bergerac at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons.[26] Ben Brantley of The New York Times described her performance as "captivating": " Ms. Garner, I am pleased to report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... [She] speaks Anthony Burgess’s peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she’s a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable."[69] The New Yorker's theater critic was impressed by her "feistiness" and " lightness of comic touch".[70] The play was recorded before a live audience and aired on PBS in 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.[71]




Garner in 2009 at a press conference for The Invention of Lying


Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first appeared opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. While Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune found Garner "easy to like and sharp with her timing", he was disappointed to see her as "the love interest, which is not the same as a rounded character."[72] Similarly, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was dismayed to see the actress appear as "less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words “enter generic female lead” in [the] screenplay)."[73] Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner - "always happy and always pleasant to everyone" - against type.[74] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she "proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on."[75] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised an "inspired, seemingly effortless, performance"[76] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before."[77] Garner then appeared in Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day (2010), sharing scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey.[78] In 2011, she had a supporting role in Arthur as the villainous arranged bride of Russell Brand's character.[79][80]
2012–present[edit]




Garner at the premiere of Butter in 2011


Garner played a mother for the first time in 2012,[5] starring opposite Joel Edgerton in the drama The Odd Life of Timothy Green.[81] It received mixed reviews from critics and was a modest commercial success.[82][83] Claudia Puig of USA Today found her "convincing as a warm-hearted, if tense, mom"[84] while Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said she brought "fervent sincerity and a welcome touch of comic eccentricity" to the role.[85] Also in 2012, Garner starred in the satirical comedy Butter, which received mixed feedback from critics and poor earnings at the box office.[86][87] Peter Debruge of Variety praised "the best bigscreen use of Jennifer Garner’s comedy gifts since 13 Going on 30”[88] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as the "best in show" : "[She] knows how to play comedy of the absurd."[89] However, Scott Bowles of USA Today remarked: "Garner is a terrific actress, but here she's asked to cackle her lines in a voice a full octave above her natural one."[90] Also in 2012, she appeared opposite Alfred Molina in the YouTube short Serena.[91] Also in 2012, she became a spokesperson for food company Luvo.[92]
Garner reunited with Matthew McConaughey in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club, which received positive reviews and was a box office success.[93][94] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as "a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity"[95] while Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post remarked: "McConaughey and Leto may have the showiest roles, but Garner deserves equal praise for her sensitive, straightforward performance."[96] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said: "Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here."[97] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said: "It’s not a well-shaped role, but I’ve gotten to the point where I’m happy to see Garner in anything. She’s incapable of phoniness."[98] Also in 2013, she became the first celebrity spokesperson of Max Mara.[99]
In 2014, she starred opposte Kevin Costner in the sports drama Draft Day. Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle remarked: "It's not much of a role, but she's perfectly nice in it. Perhaps someday someone will give Garner a chance to be something other than perfectly nice."[100] Garner also co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2014 Disney adaptation of the popular children's book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. Sandie Angulo Chen of the Washington Post said: "Garner, who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms, is pleasantly frazzled."[101] Also in 2014, Garner appeared in Men, Women & Children. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said: "Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it’s not much. The role is like a caricature of her performance in Juno, minus the ultimate (and essential) redemption."[102] In late 2014, Capital One signed Garner as their spokeswoman for their Capital One Venture Air Miles credit card.[103] In 2015's Danny Collins, starring Al Pacino and Annette Bening, Garner had a supporting role as the wife of Bobby Cannavale's character. Stephanie Merry of the Washington Post felt she "gives the movie a powerful jolt of emotion."[104]
In 2016, Garner appeared in the Christian drama Miracles from Heaven. Ken Jaworowski of The New York Times praised a "dedicated" and "heartfelt" performance[105] while Nigel Smith of The Guardian found "her subtly wrought work ... tremendously effective" in an otherwise "crassly manipulative" film.[106] She starred opposite Kevin Spacey in the comedy Nine Lives. Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times jokingly asked Garner to "send us some kind of signal if you need help"[107] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said she was "stranded in a nothing role."[108] She also made an uncredited cameo appearance in Mother's Day.
Wakefield will be released in May 2017.[109] The Tribes of Palos Verdes, filmed in 2016, is awaiting a release date. In 2017, she will provide the voice of Mama Llama for Netflix’s new original animated preschool series Llama Llama while, in 2018, she will provide a voice for a character in Amusement Park. In early 2017, she filmed a role in Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda.[110] She has also filmed a role in friend Judy Greer's directorial debut A Happening of Monumental Proportions, set for release in 2017.[111][112]
Activism[edit]
Early childhood education[edit]




Garner with a preschooler at a Capitol Hill event in 2013


In 2009, Garner became an artist ambassador for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts.[113][114] Since 2014,[115] Garner has served on the board of trustees for Save the Children,[116][117] the United States branch of the British children's charity,[118] advocating for early education.[119] She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years.[120] In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children.[121] In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: "My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... I want her to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have to make the world a better place for everyone."[122] In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign.,[117] and in January 2015, she appeared in A Path Appears, a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.[123]
Other[edit]
In 2007, Garner said she was "not a particularly outwardly political person."[68] In 2002, Garner filmed a 30-second television advertisement for her childhood friend Corey Palumbo, running as a Democratic candidate for the West Virginia House of Delegates.[124] In 2006, Garner spoke at a rally in support of Democratic Congressional candidate Jerry McNerney in Pleasanton, California.[125] In 2008, she hosted two fundraisers for Obama during the 2008 Democratic Primary.[126][127] In 2014, Garner donated $25,000 to the campaign of Democratic politician Wendy Davis.[128] During the 2016 presidential campaign, Garner hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Bozeman, Montana[129] and attended voter registration and phone bank events for Clinton in Reno, Nevada.[130]
Garner has campaigned for laws to protect her children from paparazzi. "There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside our door every single day. My kids take karate for example, and we have our classes at the same time every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids."[131] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers.[132] The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.[133]
In 2007, she appeared in a global warming awareness video produced by the Center for American Progress Action Fund.[134]
Personal life[edit]
Relationships and family[edit]
Garner had a five-year relationship with Scott Foley. They met on the set of Felicity in 1998.[3] They married in a ceremony at their home on October 19, 2000 and separated in March 2003.[135] Garner filed for divorce in May 2003, citing irreconcilable differences, and divorce papers were granted in March 2004.[136] Garner later described it as "a crushing experience. I thought the divorce statistics would never apply to me ... I wanted to be married for as long as my parents."[137][138] She dated her Alias co-star Michael Vartan from August 2003 to mid-2004.[139][140]




Garner with husband Ben Affleck at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards


Garner began dating Ben Affleck in mid-2004,[141] having established a friendship on the sets of Pearl Harbor (2001) and Daredevil (2003).[142] They were married on June 29, 2005, in a private Turks and Caicos ceremony.[143] Victor Garber, who officiated the ceremony, and his husband Rainer Andreesen were the only guests.[144] Garner and Affleck have three children: daughters Violet Anne (b. December 2005)[145] and Seraphina "Sera" Rose Elizabeth (b. January 2009),[146] and son Samuel "Sam" Garner (b. February 2012).[147] They announced their intention to divorce in June 2015,[148] and jointly filed legal documents in April 2017, seeking joint physical and legal custody of their children.[149]
Religion[edit]
Although Garner stopped attending church regularly after moving to Los Angeles,[150] each of her three children were baptised as members of the United Methodist Church in her hometown of Charleston, West Virginia.[151] In 2015, she and her family began attending weekly Methodist church services in Los Angeles.[151]
Stalking incident[edit]
Garner was stalked by Steven Burky from 2002 to 2003, and again from 2008 to 2009. She, her husband, and her daughter Violet obtained a restraining order in 2008.[152] Burky was arrested in December 2009 outside her daughter's preschool.[153] He was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. In March 2010, he was ruled insane, sent to California's state mental hospital, and ordered to stay away from the Affleck family for 10 years if released from hospital.[154]

Early life[edit]
Jennifer Garner was born on April 17, 1972 in Houston, Texas but moved to Charleston, West Virginia at the age of three.[2] Her father, William John Garner, worked as a chemical engineer for Union Carbide and her mother, Patricia Ann (née English), was a homemaker and, later, an English teacher at a local college.[3][4] She has an older sister, Melissa Wylie, and a younger sister, Susannah Carpenter. Garner has described herself as a typical middle child who sought to differentiate herself from her accomplished older sister.[5][6] While Garner did not grow up in a politically active household,[7] her father was "very conservative" and her mother "quietly blue."[8] She attended a local United Methodist Church every Sunday and went to Vacation Bible School.[9] As teenagers, Garner and her sisters were not allowed to wear makeup, paint their nails, pierce their ears or dye their hair;[10][11] she has joked that her family's "take on the world" was "practically Amish."[12]
Garner attended George Washington High School in Charleston;[13] she played saxophone in the marching band and was water girl for the football team.[2][14] While Garner was not a bad student, she did not get "straight As" and instead wanted to perform "in any kind of production."[8] She participated in musicals at the local community theater, the Charleston Light Opera Guild,[15] and took piano, singing and ballet lessons.[14][2] In 1990, Garner enrolled at Denison University in Granville, Ohio,[16] where she changed her major from chemistry to theater[17] and was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority.[18] She spent the fall semester of 1993 studying at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut.[19] In 1994, she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater performance.[20]
Acting career[edit]
1994–2001: Career beginnings and Alias[edit]
As a college student, Garner did summer stock theater. In addition to performing, Garner helped to sell tickets, build sets, and clean the venues.[21] She worked at the Timber Lake Playhouse in Mount Carroll, Illinois in 1992,[22] the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan in 1993,[23] and the Georgia Shakespeare Festival in Atlanta, Georgia in 1994.[24] Garner moved to New York City in 1995.[25] During her first year in the city, Garner earned $150 per week as an understudy for a Roundabout Theatre Company production of A Month in the Country, starring Helen Mirren and F. Murray Abraham,[6][26] and made her first on-screen appearance as Melissa Gilbert's daughter in the romance miniseries Zoya.[27] In 1996, she played an Amish woman in the television movie Harvest of Fire[28] and a flirtatious shopkeeper in the Western miniseries Dead Man's Walk.[29] She appeared in the independent short film In Harm's Way[30] and made one-off appearances in the legal dramas Swift Justice and Law & Order. She met Stephen Colbert while filming an episode of Spin City and became an occasional babysitter for his children.[31] Garner also supplemented her income by working as a hostess at Isabella's restaurant on the Upper East Side.[32]
After moving to Los Angeles in 1997, Garner won her first leading role in the television movie Rose Hill[33] and made her first feature film appearance in the period drama Washington Square.[34] She appeared in the comedy movie Mr. Magoo, the independent drama 1999 and Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry; most of her performance was cut from Allen's film.[35] In 1998, Garner appeared in an episode of Fantasy Island and was cast as a series regular in the Fox drama Significant Others. Will Joyner of The New York Times praised her ability to "provide the leavening ingredient of innocent insight"[36] but Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly felt there was no center to the character, as played by Garner.[37] Fox cancelled the series after airing three of six filmed episodes. Garner's most significant role of 1998 was in J.J. Abrams' college drama Felicity. During a two-episode guest appearance, she befriended Abrams and met her first husband Scott Foley.[38] In 1999, Garner was cast as a series regular in another Fox drama, Time of Your Life, but it was cancelled midway through the first season.[39] Also in 1999, she appeared in the miniseries Aftershock: Earthquake in New York and in two episodes of the action drama The Pretender. Garner played the girlfriend of Ashton Kutcher's character in the comedy Dude, Where's My Car? (2000). In 2001, she appeared briefly opposite her husband Foley in the drama Stealing Time and had a small role as a nurse in the war epic Pearl Harbor.[40]
Garner rose to fame in 2001 when she was cast as the star of the ABC spy drama Alias.[3] The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: "I always thought she had something in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that."[38] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role.[41] Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: "You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross."[42] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought "an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness" to the role.[43] Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end.[44] During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.
2002–11: Transition to film[edit]
While Alias was airing, Garner continued to work in film intermittently. She had an "other-worldly" experience when Steven Spielberg called to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in Catch Me if You Can (2002).[45] After seeing her in Alias, Speilberg felt sure "she would be the next superstar".[46] She filmed her scene opposite Leonardo DiCaprio during a one-day shoot.[47] Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action movie Daredevil (2003), in which she played Elektra to Ben Affleck's Daredevil.[48] The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered "an aptitude for" while working on Alias.[45][49] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said she "realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines. She hasn't mastered the combat skill of tossing off bad material."[50] While Daredevil received mixed reviews, it was a box office success.[51] Also in 2003, Garner voiced herself in an episode of The Simpsons.
Garner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy 13 Going on 30 (2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a 30-year old. Garner chose Gary Winick to direct the film[52] and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011.[53][54] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found her "startling": "Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else."[55] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised an "utterly beguiling" performance: "You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star."[56] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post remarked: "Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for."[57] 13 Going on 30 was a moderate commercial success.[58] Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005 Daredevil spin-off Elektra; it was a box office and critical failure.[59] Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded that Garner "is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in 13 Going on 30.[60] Garner next starred opposite Timothy Olyphant in the romantic drama Catch and Release. Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons of Alias, it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget.[61] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Garner's ability "to blend charm and gravity"[62] but Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that, while her "natural beauty and likability are still assets, [she] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role."[63]
After a one-year break following the conclusion of Alias, her wedding to Affleck, and the birth of her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in Juno as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of New York Magazine as a turning point in her career: "She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman expertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card."[64] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said she had never "been lovelier or more affecting."[65] She played an FBI investigator in the action thriller The Kingdom (2007).[66][67] She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke.[68] In late 2007 and early 2008, Garner played Roxanne to Kevin Kline's Cyrano de Bergerac at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons.[26] Ben Brantley of The New York Times described her performance as "captivating": " Ms. Garner, I am pleased to report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... [She] speaks Anthony Burgess’s peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she’s a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable."[69] The New Yorker's theater critic was impressed by her "feistiness" and " lightness of comic touch".[70] The play was recorded before a live audience and aired on PBS in 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.[71]




Garner in 2009 at a press conference for The Invention of Lying


Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first appeared opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. While Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune found Garner "easy to like and sharp with her timing", he was disappointed to see her as "the love interest, which is not the same as a rounded character."[72] Similarly, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was dismayed to see the actress appear as "less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words “enter generic female lead” in [the] screenplay)."[73] Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner - "always happy and always pleasant to everyone" - against type.[74] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she "proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on."[75] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised an "inspired, seemingly effortless, performance"[76] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before."[77] Garner then appeared in Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day (2010), sharing scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey.[78] In 2011, she had a supporting role in Arthur as the villainous arranged bride of Russell Brand's character.[79][80]
2012–present[edit]




Garner at the premiere of Butter in 2011


Garner played a mother for the first time in 2012,[5] starring opposite Joel Edgerton in the drama The Odd Life of Timothy Green.[81] It received mixed reviews from critics and was a modest commercial success.[82][83] Claudia Puig of USA Today found her "convincing as a warm-hearted, if tense, mom"[84] while Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said she brought "fervent sincerity and a welcome touch of comic eccentricity" to the role.[85] Also in 2012, Garner starred in the satirical comedy Butter, which received mixed feedback from critics and poor earnings at the box office.[86][87] Peter Debruge of Variety praised "the best bigscreen use of Jennifer Garner’s comedy gifts since 13 Going on 30”[88] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as the "best in show" : "[She] knows how to play comedy of the absurd."[89] However, Scott Bowles of USA Today remarked: "Garner is a terrific actress, but here she's asked to cackle her lines in a voice a full octave above her natural one."[90] Also in 2012, she appeared opposite Alfred Molina in the YouTube short Serena.[91] Also in 2012, she became a spokesperson for food company Luvo.[92]
Garner reunited with Matthew McConaughey in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club, which received positive reviews and was a box office success.[93][94] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as "a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity"[95] while Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post remarked: "McConaughey and Leto may have the showiest roles, but Garner deserves equal praise for her sensitive, straightforward performance."[96] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said: "Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here."[97] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said: "It’s not a well-shaped role, but I’ve gotten to the point where I’m happy to see Garner in anything. She’s incapable of phoniness."[98] Also in 2013, she became the first celebrity spokesperson of Max Mara.[99]
In 2014, she starred opposte Kevin Costner in the sports drama Draft Day. Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle remarked: "It's not much of a role, but she's perfectly nice in it. Perhaps someday someone will give Garner a chance to be something other than perfectly nice."[100] Garner also co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2014 Disney adaptation of the popular children's book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. Sandie Angulo Chen of the Washington Post said: "Garner, who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms, is pleasantly frazzled."[101] Also in 2014, Garner appeared in Men, Women & Children. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said: "Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it’s not much. The role is like a caricature of her performance in Juno, minus the ultimate (and essential) redemption."[102] In late 2014, Capital One signed Garner as their spokeswoman for their Capital One Venture Air Miles credit card.[103] In 2015's Danny Collins, starring Al Pacino and Annette Bening, Garner had a supporting role as the wife of Bobby Cannavale's character. Stephanie Merry of the Washington Post felt she "gives the movie a powerful jolt of emotion."[104]
In 2016, Garner appeared in the Christian drama Miracles from Heaven. Ken Jaworowski of The New York Times praised a "dedicated" and "heartfelt" performance[105] while Nigel Smith of The Guardian found "her subtly wrought work ... tremendously effective" in an otherwise "crassly manipulative" film.[106] She starred opposite Kevin Spacey in the comedy Nine Lives. Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times jokingly asked Garner to "send us some kind of signal if you need help"[107] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said she was "stranded in a nothing role."[108] She also made an uncredited cameo appearance in Mother's Day.
Wakefield will be released in May 2017.[109] The Tribes of Palos Verdes, filmed in 2016, is awaiting a release date. In 2017, she will provide the voice of Mama Llama for Netflix’s new original animated preschool series Llama Llama while, in 2018, she will provide a voice for a character in Amusement Park. In early 2017, she filmed a role in Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda.[110] She has also filmed a role in friend Judy Greer's directorial debut A Happening of Monumental Proportions, set for release in 2017.[111][112]
Activism[edit]
Early childhood education[edit]




Garner with a preschooler at a Capitol Hill event in 2013


In 2009, Garner became an artist ambassador for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts.[113][114] Since 2014,[115] Garner has served on the board of trustees for Save the Children,[116][117] the United States branch of the British children's charity,[118] advocating for early education.[119] She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years.[120] In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children.[121] In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: "My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... I want her to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have to make the world a better place for everyone."[122] In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign.,[117] and in January 2015, she appeared in A Path Appears, a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.[123]
Other[edit]
In 2007, Garner said she was "not a particularly outwardly political person."[68] In 2002, Garner filmed a 30-second television advertisement for her childhood friend Corey Palumbo, running as a Democratic candidate for the West Virginia House of Delegates.[124] In 2006, Garner spoke at a rally in support of Democratic Congressional candidate Jerry McNerney in Pleasanton, California.[125] In 2008, she hosted two fundraisers for Obama during the 2008 Democratic Primary.[126][127] In 2014, Garner donated $25,000 to the campaign of Democratic politician Wendy Davis.[128] During the 2016 presidential campaign, Garner hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Bozeman, Montana[129] and attended voter registration and phone bank events for Clinton in Reno, Nevada.[130]
Garner has campaigned for laws to protect her children from paparazzi. "There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside our door every single day. My kids take karate for example, and we have our classes at the same time every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids."[131] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers.[132] The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.[133]
In 2007, she appeared in a global warming awareness video produced by the Center for American Progress Action Fund.[134]
Personal life[edit]
Relationships and family[edit]
Garner had a five-year relationship with Scott Foley. They met on the set of Felicity in 1998.[3] They married in a ceremony at their home on October 19, 2000 and separated in March 2003.[135] Garner filed for divorce in May 2003, citing irreconcilable differences, and divorce papers were granted in March 2004.[136] Garner later described it as "a crushing experience. I thought the divorce statistics would never apply to me ... I wanted to be married for as long as my parents."[137][138] She dated her Alias co-star Michael Vartan from August 2003 to mid-2004.[139][140]




Garner with husband Ben Affleck at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards


Garner began dating Ben Affleck in mid-2004,[141] having established a friendship on the sets of Pearl Harbor (2001) and Daredevil (2003).[142] They were married on June 29, 2005, in a private Turks and Caicos ceremony.[143] Victor Garber, who officiated the ceremony, and his husband Rainer Andreesen were the only guests.[144] Garner and Affleck have three children: daughters Violet Anne (b. December 2005)[145] and Seraphina "Sera" Rose Elizabeth (b. January 2009),[146] and son Samuel "Sam" Garner (b. February 2012).[147] They announced their intention to divorce in June 2015,[148] and jointly filed legal documents in April 2017, seeking joint physical and legal custody of their children.[149]
Religion[edit]
Although Garner stopped attending church regularly after moving to Los Angeles,[150] each of her three children were baptised as members of the United Methodist Church in her hometown of Charleston, West Virginia.[151] In 2015, she and her family began attending weekly Methodist church services in Los Angeles.[151]
Stalking incident[edit]
Garner was stalked by Steven Burky from 2002 to 2003, and again from 2008 to 2009. She, her husband, and her daughter Violet obtained a restraining order in 2008.[152] Burky was arrested in December 2009 outside her daughter's preschool.[153] He was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. In March 2010, he was ruled insane, sent to California's state mental hospital, and ordered to stay away from the Affleck family for 10 years if released from hospital.[154]

Early life[edit]
Jennifer Garner was born on April 17, 1972 in Houston, Texas but moved to Charleston, West Virginia at the age of three.[2] Her father, William John Garner, worked as a chemical engineer for Union Carbide and her mother, Patricia Ann (née English), was a homemaker and, later, an English teacher at a local college.[3][4] She has an older sister, Melissa Wylie, and a younger sister, Susannah Carpenter. Garner has described herself as a typical middle child who sought to differentiate herself from her accomplished older sister.[5][6] While Garner did not grow up in a politically active household,[7] her father was "very conservative" and her mother "quietly blue."[8] She attended a local United Methodist Church every Sunday and went to Vacation Bible School.[9] As teenagers, Garner and her sisters were not allowed to wear makeup, paint their nails, pierce their ears or dye their hair;[10][11] she has joked that her family's "take on the world" was "practically Amish."[12]
Garner attended George Washington High School in Charleston;[13] she played saxophone in the marching band and was water girl for the football team.[2][14] While Garner was not a bad student, she did not get "straight As" and instead wanted to perform "in any kind of production."[8] She participated in musicals at the local community theater, the Charleston Light Opera Guild,[15] and took piano, singing and ballet lessons.[14][2] In 1990, Garner enrolled at Denison University in Granville, Ohio,[16] where she changed her major from chemistry to theater[17] and was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority.[18] She spent the fall semester of 1993 studying at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut.[19] In 1994, she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater performance.[20]
Acting career[edit]
1994–2001: Career beginnings and Alias[edit]
As a college student, Garner did summer stock theater. In addition to performing, Garner helped to sell tickets, build sets, and clean the venues.[21] She worked at the Timber Lake Playhouse in Mount Carroll, Illinois in 1992,[22] the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan in 1993,[23] and the Georgia Shakespeare Festival in Atlanta, Georgia in 1994.[24] Garner moved to New York City in 1995.[25] During her first year in the city, Garner earned $150 per week as an understudy for a Roundabout Theatre Company production of A Month in the Country, starring Helen Mirren and F. Murray Abraham,[6][26] and made her first on-screen appearance as Melissa Gilbert's daughter in the romance miniseries Zoya.[27] In 1996, she played an Amish woman in the television movie Harvest of Fire[28] and a flirtatious shopkeeper in the Western miniseries Dead Man's Walk.[29] She appeared in the independent short film In Harm's Way[30] and made one-off appearances in the legal dramas Swift Justice and Law & Order. She met Stephen Colbert while filming an episode of Spin City and became an occasional babysitter for his children.[31] Garner also supplemented her income by working as a hostess at Isabella's restaurant on the Upper East Side.[32]
After moving to Los Angeles in 1997, Garner won her first leading role in the television movie Rose Hill[33] and made her first feature film appearance in the period drama Washington Square.[34] She appeared in the comedy movie Mr. Magoo, the independent drama 1999 and Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry; most of her performance was cut from Allen's film.[35] In 1998, Garner appeared in an episode of Fantasy Island and was cast as a series regular in the Fox drama Significant Others. Will Joyner of The New York Times praised her ability to "provide the leavening ingredient of innocent insight"[36] but Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly felt there was no center to the character, as played by Garner.[37] Fox cancelled the series after airing three of six filmed episodes. Garner's most significant role of 1998 was in J.J. Abrams' college drama Felicity. During a two-episode guest appearance, she befriended Abrams and met her first husband Scott Foley.[38] In 1999, Garner was cast as a series regular in another Fox drama, Time of Your Life, but it was cancelled midway through the first season.[39] Also in 1999, she appeared in the miniseries Aftershock: Earthquake in New York and in two episodes of the action drama The Pretender. Garner played the girlfriend of Ashton Kutcher's character in the comedy Dude, Where's My Car? (2000). In 2001, she appeared briefly opposite her husband Foley in the drama Stealing Time and had a small role as a nurse in the war epic Pearl Harbor.[40]
Garner rose to fame in 2001 when she was cast as the star of the ABC spy drama Alias.[3] The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: "I always thought she had something in her personality that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that."[38] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role.[41] Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: "You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross."[42] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought "an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness" to the role.[43] Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end.[44] During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.
2002–11: Transition to film[edit]
While Alias was airing, Garner continued to work in film intermittently. She had an "other-worldly" experience when Steven Spielberg called to offer her a role as a high-class call girl in Catch Me if You Can (2002).[45] After seeing her in Alias, Speilberg felt sure "she would be the next superstar".[46] She filmed her scene opposite Leonardo DiCaprio during a one-day shoot.[47] Garner's first co-starring film role was in the action movie Daredevil (2003), in which she played Elektra to Ben Affleck's Daredevil.[48] The physicality required for the role was something Garner had discovered "an aptitude for" while working on Alias.[45][49] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times said she "realizes Elektra more through movement than by way of her lumpy, obvious lines. She hasn't mastered the combat skill of tossing off bad material."[50] While Daredevil received mixed reviews, it was a box office success.[51] Also in 2003, Garner voiced herself in an episode of The Simpsons.
Garner's first leading film role, in the romantic comedy 13 Going on 30 (2004), was widely praised. She played a teenager who finds herself trapped in the body of a 30-year old. Garner chose Gary Winick to direct the film[52] and they continued to look for other projects to do together until his death in 2011.[53][54] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times found her "startling": "Whenever she's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else."[55] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised an "utterly beguiling" performance: "You can pinpoint the moment in it when Garner becomes a star."[56] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post remarked: "Garner is clearly cut out to be America's next Sweetheart; she has the same magic mix of allure and accessibility that the job calls for."[57] 13 Going on 30 was a moderate commercial success.[58] Garner reprised the character of Elektra in the 2005 Daredevil spin-off Elektra; it was a box office and critical failure.[59] Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded that Garner "is far more appealing when she's playing charming and adorable, as she did so winningly in 13 Going on 30.[60] Garner next starred opposite Timothy Olyphant in the romantic drama Catch and Release. Although filmed in 2005 in between seasons of Alias, it was not released until early 2007 and failed to recoup its production budget.[61] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised Garner's ability "to blend charm and gravity"[62] but Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that, while her "natural beauty and likability are still assets, [she] seems occasionally challenged by what should be an easy role."[63]
After a one-year break following the conclusion of Alias, her wedding to Affleck, and the birth of her first child, Garner returned to work in 2007. Her supporting role in Juno as a woman desperate to adopt a child was described by Kyle Buchanan of New York Magazine as a turning point in her career: "She came into the movie a steely figure, and left it as the mother you'd give your own child to ... Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman expertly deploy Garner's innate humanity as a trump card."[64] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said she had never "been lovelier or more affecting."[65] She played an FBI investigator in the action thriller The Kingdom (2007).[66][67] She was nursing her baby during filming in Arizona and was hospitalized on two occasions with heatstroke.[68] In late 2007 and early 2008, Garner played Roxanne to Kevin Kline's Cyrano de Bergerac at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In preparation for the role, Garner worked with vocal and movement coaches and took French lessons.[26] Ben Brantley of The New York Times described her performance as "captivating": " Ms. Garner, I am pleased to report, makes Roxane a girl worth pining over ... [She] speaks Anthony Burgess’s peppery rhymed translation with unaffected sprightliness. If she’s a tad stilted in the big tragic finale, her comic timing is impeccable."[69] The New Yorker's theater critic was impressed by her "feistiness" and " lightness of comic touch".[70] The play was recorded before a live audience and aired on PBS in 2008. In 2007, Garner became a spokesperson of skin care brand Neutrogena.[71]




Garner in 2009 at a press conference for The Invention of Lying


Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first appeared opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. While Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune found Garner "easy to like and sharp with her timing", he was disappointed to see her as "the love interest, which is not the same as a rounded character."[72] Similarly, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was dismayed to see the actress appear as "less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words “enter generic female lead” in [the] screenplay)."[73] Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner - "always happy and always pleasant to everyone" - against type.[74] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she "proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on."[75] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised an "inspired, seemingly effortless, performance"[76] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before."[77] Garner then appeared in Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy Valentine's Day (2010), sharing scenes with Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Biel and Patrick Dempsey.[78] In 2011, she had a supporting role in Arthur as the villainous arranged bride of Russell Brand's character.[79][80]
2012–present[edit]




Garner at the premiere of Butter in 2011


Garner played a mother for the first time in 2012,[5] starring opposite Joel Edgerton in the drama The Odd Life of Timothy Green.[81] It received mixed reviews from critics and was a modest commercial success.[82][83] Claudia Puig of USA Today found her "convincing as a warm-hearted, if tense, mom"[84] while Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said she brought "fervent sincerity and a welcome touch of comic eccentricity" to the role.[85] Also in 2012, Garner starred in the satirical comedy Butter, which received mixed feedback from critics and poor earnings at the box office.[86][87] Peter Debruge of Variety praised "the best bigscreen use of Jennifer Garner’s comedy gifts since 13 Going on 30”[88] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as the "best in show" : "[She] knows how to play comedy of the absurd."[89] However, Scott Bowles of USA Today remarked: "Garner is a terrific actress, but here she's asked to cackle her lines in a voice a full octave above her natural one."[90] Also in 2012, she appeared opposite Alfred Molina in the YouTube short Serena.[91] Also in 2012, she became a spokesperson for food company Luvo.[92]
Garner reunited with Matthew McConaughey in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club, which received positive reviews and was a box office success.[93][94] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described her as "a radiant actress of rare spirit and sensitivity"[95] while Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post remarked: "McConaughey and Leto may have the showiest roles, but Garner deserves equal praise for her sensitive, straightforward performance."[96] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said: "Garner is once again cast as a quintessentially decent, all-American girl, albeit a doctor. But the question of whether the actress has deeper emotional layers to bring to the screen is not answered here."[97] David Edelstein of New York Magazine said: "It’s not a well-shaped role, but I’ve gotten to the point where I’m happy to see Garner in anything. She’s incapable of phoniness."[98] Also in 2013, she became the first celebrity spokesperson of Max Mara.[99]
In 2014, she starred opposte Kevin Costner in the sports drama Draft Day. Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle remarked: "It's not much of a role, but she's perfectly nice in it. Perhaps someday someone will give Garner a chance to be something other than perfectly nice."[100] Garner also co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2014 Disney adaptation of the popular children's book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. Sandie Angulo Chen of the Washington Post said: "Garner, who has long mastered the art of playing harried and overworked moms, is pleasantly frazzled."[101] Also in 2014, Garner appeared in Men, Women & Children. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said: "Garner does what she can as the Snooping Mom from Hell, but ultimately it’s not much. The role is like a caricature of her performance in Juno, minus the ultimate (and essential) redemption."[102] In late 2014, Capital One signed Garner as their spokeswoman for their Capital One Venture Air Miles credit card.[103] In 2015's Danny Collins, starring Al Pacino and Annette Bening, Garner had a supporting role as the wife of Bobby Cannavale's character. Stephanie Merry of the Washington Post felt she "gives the movie a powerful jolt of emotion."[104]
In 2016, Garner appeared in the Christian drama Miracles from Heaven. Ken Jaworowski of The New York Times praised a "dedicated" and "heartfelt" performance[105] while Nigel Smith of The Guardian found "her subtly wrought work ... tremendously effective" in an otherwise "crassly manipulative" film.[106] She starred opposite Kevin Spacey in the comedy Nine Lives. Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times jokingly asked Garner to "send us some kind of signal if you need help"[107] while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said she was "stranded in a nothing role."[108] She also made an uncredited cameo appearance in Mother's Day.
Wakefield will be released in May 2017.[109] The Tribes of Palos Verdes, filmed in 2016, is awaiting a release date. In 2017, she will provide the voice of Mama Llama for Netflix’s new original animated preschool series Llama Llama while, in 2018, she will provide a voice for a character in Amusement Park. In early 2017, she filmed a role in Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda.[110] She has also filmed a role in friend Judy Greer's directorial debut A Happening of Monumental Proportions, set for release in 2017.[111][112]
Activism[edit]
Early childhood education[edit]




Garner with a preschooler at a Capitol Hill event in 2013


In 2009, Garner became an artist ambassador for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts.[113][114] Since 2014,[115] Garner has served on the board of trustees for Save the Children,[116][117] the United States branch of the British children's charity,[118] advocating for early education.[119] She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years.[120] In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children.[121] In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: "My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... I want her to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have to make the world a better place for everyone."[122] In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign.,[117] and in January 2015, she appeared in A Path Appears, a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.[123]
Other[edit]
In 2007, Garner said she was "not a particularly outwardly political person."[68] In 2002, Garner filmed a 30-second television advertisement for her childhood friend Corey Palumbo, running as a Democratic candidate for the West Virginia House of Delegates.[124] In 2006, Garner spoke at a rally in support of Democratic Congressional candidate Jerry McNerney in Pleasanton, California.[125] In 2008, she hosted two fundraisers for Obama during the 2008 Democratic Primary.[126][127] In 2014, Garner donated $25,000 to the campaign of Democratic politician Wendy Davis.[128] During the 2016 presidential campaign, Garner hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Bozeman, Montana[129] and attended voter registration and phone bank events for Clinton in Reno, Nevada.[130]
Garner has campaigned for laws to protect her children from paparazzi. "There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside our door every single day. My kids take karate for example, and we have our classes at the same time every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids."[131] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers.[132] The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.[133]
In 2007, she appeared in a global warming awareness video produced by the Center for American Progress Action Fund.[134]

Garner had a five-year relationship with Scott Foley. They met on the set of Felicity in 1998.[3] They married in a ceremony at their home on October 19, 2000 and separated in March 2003.[135] Garner filed for divorce in May 2003, citing irreconcilable differences, and divorce papers were granted in March 2004.[136] Garner later described it as "a crushing experience. I thought the divorce statistics would never apply to me ... I wanted to be married for as long as my parents."[137][138] She dated her Alias co-star Michael Vartan from August 2003 to mid-2004.[139][140]




Garner with husband Ben Affleck at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards


Garner began dating Ben Affleck in mid-2004,[141] having established a friendship on the sets of Pearl Harbor (2001) and Daredevil (2003).[142] They were married on June 29, 2005, in a private Turks and Caicos ceremony.[143] Victor Garber, who officiated the ceremony, and his husband Rainer Andreesen were the only guests.[144] Garner and Affleck have three children: daughters Violet Anne (b. December 2005)[145] and Seraphina "Sera" Rose Elizabeth (b. January 2009),[146] and son Samuel "Sam" Garner (b. February 2012).[147] They announced their intention to divorce in June 2015,[148] and jointly filed legal documents in April 2017, seeking joint physical and legal custody of their children.[149]
Religion[edit]
Although Garner stopped attending church regularly after moving to Los Angeles,[150] each of her three children were baptised as members of the United Methodist Church in her hometown of Charleston, West Virginia.[151] In 2015, she and her family began attending weekly Methodist church services in Los Angeles.[151]
Stalking incident[edit]
Garner was stalked by Steven Burky from 2002 to 2003, and again from 2008 to 2009. She, her husband, and her daughter Violet obtained a restraining order in 2008.[152] Burky was arrested in December 2009 outside her daughter's preschool.[153] He was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. In March 2010, he was ruled insane, sent to California's state mental hospital, and ordered to stay away from the Affleck family for 10 years if released from hospital.[154]

                                            Ben Affleck has a new lady!                                        










                                            ET confirmed on Friday that Affleck is dating Saturday Night Live producer Lindsday Shookus, just three months after he and Jennifer Garner filed for divorce.                                        





WATCH: Ben Affleck Dating 'SNL' Producer 3 Months After Filing for Divorce From Jennifer Garner 

                                            "Ben and Lindsay have known each other for a couple of years," a source told ET.  "Ben has been on SNL five times and has met Lindsay while hosting the show. It is early on in the relationship but they are very happy together."                                        

                                            "[She] knows what is expected of Ben, and how much of their relationship they can share publicly," the source continued of Shookus and Affleck's romance. "It puts Ben at ease knowing that Lindsay understands who he is. They have kept their relationship very low key and private."                                        

                                            Shookus may be private about her relationship with Affleck, but her professional accomplishments are well known. Here are seven thing to know about the 37-year-old producer.                                         


1. She's From New York
 

                                            Shookus hails from Buffalo, New York, where her dad is in the housewares and consumer products business, and her mom is a sales representative, according to The New York Times. The blonde beauty left the East Coast for college, when she attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.                                         


2. She's a Power Player
 

                                            The producer was featured on The Hollywood Reporter's Next Gen 2015: Hollywood's Up-and-Coming Execs 35 and Under list for her work on Saturday Night Live, where she's worked up the ranks after starting as an assistant to a producer right after college.

3. She Met Matt Damon Her First Week at SNL
 

                                            Shookus seems to go way back with Affleck's pal, Matt Damon, as the actor hosted Saturday Night Live during Shookus' first week on the show. "I remember thinking, 'How is this my job?'" she told THR.  


4. She's Got an Eye for Talent
 

                                            "When I started as an assistant at SNL, I got my eyes on Kristen Wiig and was able to bring her for an audition for Lorne Michaels and the other producers," Shookus, who also hired Vanessa Bayer and Jon Rudnitsky, told THR. "Turns out, Kristen Wiig can give you some street cred early on."                                        


WATCH: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner Celebrate July 4th Together, Take Their Kids to Parade 


5. She's a Mom
 

                                            Shookus opened up about motherhood during her 2015 profile with The Hollywood Reporter. 
 

                                            "My 2-year-old has become my alarm, so on a good day, 7:30 a.m. or 8 a.m. My alarm sounds something like, 'MAMA, where ARE yooooou?'" she joked.                                        

6. She Enjoys Fine Dining
 


Shookus and Affleck were spotted enjoying a delicious dinner at Giorgio Baldi in Los Angeles last week, according to E! News, where they shared lobster and pasta dishes, with a side of PDA. They were "very intimate and touchy," the outlet reported. 
Additional reporting by Jennifer Peros.

The actress has handled their split with incredible grace, choosing to not cast her man in a bad light after it was claimed in July he had gotten intimate with their children's nanny.Instead, she has put on a united front with the Oscar winner and has been focusing on her family as the exes have headed to therapy and attended church together.In late October she and Ben were seen side-by-side in a car as they headed to a grocery store near their respective homes in the Pacific Palisades.Meanwhile, Ben has been filming Live By Night in Brunswick, Georgia.

Why We Care So Much About Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner’s BreakupHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearch0Why We Care So Much About Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner’s BreakupYahoo Health•July 1, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareBennifer, no more. (Photo: Corbis/INFphoto.com)A ripple of shock and sadness emanated through the social media-sphere when seemingly solid Hollywood couple Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced they were ending their 10-year marriage.“After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce,” they said in a statement to People. “We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding.”Twitter exploded in response, featuring messages from apparently devastated fans: Seriously, Ben and Jen have always been this sweet, idealistic, all-American couple to me. I’m really disappointed.— Ashley Iaconetti (@ashleyiaco) June 30, 2015  Just called my mom crying because Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner broke up— hannah (@Hannnahcxo) June 30, 2015  Love is dead pic.twitter.com/CD9tm9YVhA— Ryan Broderick (@broderick) June 30, 2015  If Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner can’t make it in this world @laurendubinsky then how can we?— Max Andrew Dubinsky (@MaxDubinsky) July 1, 2015 These are some pretty intense reactions — presumably from people who have never met Affleck or Garner. So why do we, on a whole, seem to care so much about the split? “When we see a famous pair that appears authentic and in love, we root for them,” licensed clinical psychologist Erika Martinez, PsyD, tells Yahoo Health. “We’re all hard-wired for love, to recognize it, and seek it.”We’re drawn to news about celebrity couples in particular because a large part of our brain power is dedicated to relationships, Atlanta-based psychologist and relationship coach Jared DeFife, PhD, tells Yahoo Health. We follow these relationships from their infancy and feel invested in them even though they really have nothing to do with us.Related: What Happens To Your Body During a BreakupWe also tend to project our ideas of what a perfect relationship should be onto these couples, he says, and want to see them work out because of it.We’re often guilty of putting celebrities on a pedestal. We strive to emulate them — and that includes in the realm of relationships, licensed clinical psychologist Alicia H. Clark, PsyD, tells Yahoo Health.But that comes with strict criteria. “We don’t want them to be human like us; we want them to be better so we can strive to be better ourselves,” she says. When they reveal that they have relationship issues just like the rest of us, she says, it can be jarring. Martinez points out that we also tend to think celebrity couples have an edge over the rest of us in love due to their wealth — especially since money is one of the most contentious topics for couples. So, when they don’t work out, it can make us wonder what it means for our own relationships if people with so many advantages couldn’t make love last.Related: Science Says This Is How You Recover From a BreakupWhile it sounds silly, DeFife says shocking celebrity breakups can actually affect our own view of relationships — at least, over time. “Relationship ruptures, divorces, and separations in our social network have an impact on us,” he says. Most of us aren’t friends with celebrities, but we often follow their lives so closely that they seem like part of our extended network. And, when they break up, we empathize strongly with them.DeFife says the demise of Bennifer alone probably wouldn’t affect a person’s view on relationships but, if more long-lasting celebrity couples follow suit, it could eventually make an impact. “It has a cumulative effect,” he says. “Over time, it can impact our expectations and beliefs about relationships.”We’re counting on you, Beyonce and Jay-Z.Aww, Bey and Jay.

                                            Ben Affleck has a new lady!                                        










                                            ET confirmed on Friday that Affleck is dating Saturday Night Live producer Lindsday Shookus, just three months after he and Jennifer Garner filed for divorce.

                                            "Ben and Lindsay have known each other for a couple of years," a source told ET.  "Ben has been on SNL five times and has met Lindsay while hosting the show. It is early on in the relationship but they are very happy together."                                        

                                            "[She] knows what is expected of Ben, and how much of their relationship they can share publicly," the source continued of Shookus and Affleck's romance. "It puts Ben at ease knowing that Lindsay understands who he is. They have kept their relationship very low key and private."                                        

                                            Shookus may be private about her relationship with Affleck, but her professional accomplishments are well known. Here are seven thing to know about the 37-year-old producer.                                         


1. She's From New York
 

                                            Shookus hails from Buffalo, New York, where her dad is in the housewares and consumer products business, and her mom is a sales representative, according to The New York Times. The blonde beauty left the East Coast for college, when she attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.                                         


2. She's a Power Player
 

                                            The producer was featured on The Hollywood Reporter's Next Gen 2015: Hollywood's Up-and-Coming Execs 35 and Under list for her work on Saturday Night Live, where she's worked up the ranks after starting as an assistant to a producer right after college.

3. She Met Matt Damon Her First Week at SNL
 

                                            Shookus seems to go way back with Affleck's pal, Matt Damon, as the actor hosted Saturday Night Live during Shookus' first week on the show. "I remember thinking, 'How is this my job?'" she told THR.  


4. She's Got an Eye for Talent
 

                                            "When I started as an assistant at SNL, I got my eyes on Kristen Wiig and was able to bring her for an audition for Lorne Michaels and the other producers," Shookus, who also hired Vanessa Bayer and Jon Rudnitsky, told THR. "Turns out, Kristen Wiig can give you some street cred early on."

5. She's a Mom
 

                                            Shookus opened up about motherhood during her 2015 profile with The Hollywood Reporter. 
 

                                            "My 2-year-old has become my alarm, so on a good day, 7:30 a.m. or 8 a.m. My alarm sounds something like, 'MAMA, where ARE yooooou?'" she joked.                                        

6. She Enjoys Fine Dining
 


Shookus and Affleck were spotted enjoying a delicious dinner at Giorgio Baldi in Los Angeles last week, according to E! News, where they shared lobster and pasta dishes, with a side of PDA. They were "very intimate and touchy," the outlet reported.
