Reviews
"Foley's book illustrates quite convincingly that 'Linguistics
without anthropology is sterile, anthropology without linguistics
is blind'(Hockett 1973: 675)" Gunter Senft, Max-Planck-Institute
for Psycholinguistics
"I applaud Foley for having overcome one of the main constraints
of structuralist - inspired approaches to analysis." Peter
Muhlhausler, University of Adelaide
