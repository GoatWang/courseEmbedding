       The Fund’s holdings are subject to change at any time. Characteristics are expressed as a percentage of net assets except for certain closed-end funds where characteristics are expressed as a percentage of total managed assets.
All Funds (with the exception of the Money Market Fund) exclude cash and cash equivalent securities from Top holdings and Top issuers.





Goal and Strategy
The Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of total return consisting of a high level of current income and gains and long term capital appreciation.  The Fund will seek to achieve favorable after-tax returns for its shareholders by seeking to minimize the federal income tax consequences on income and gains generated by the Fund.  Under normal market condition, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying stocks of issuers located throughout the world.  The Fund also intends to write call options on a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. broad-based indices.

The performance data shown represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so that investors' shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See performance data current to the most recent month-end, which may be higher or lower than that cited.

Performance figures assume that all distributions are reinvested.

       What You Should Know
       
    





            

The Fund's market price is the last sale price as of the close of the regular market trading session. The Fund's market price as of and after July 1, 2013 reflects the last sale price in the broad market; market price prior to July 1, 2013 reflects the last sale price on the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their NAV. The Fund’s cash available for distribution will vary over time, and there is no guarantee prior distribution levels will be maintained. If, for any calendar year, the total distributions made exceed the amount of the fund's earnings and profits as computed for federal tax purposes, the excess generally will be treated as a return of capital to holders of common shares (up to the amount of each shareholder’s basis in those shares) and thereafter as gain from the sale of common shares. Such return of capital reduces the shareholder’s adjusted basis for common shares, thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing the potential loss of a subsequent sale. Distributions in any year may include a substantial return-of-capital component. An investment in the fund's Common Shares is subject to investment and market risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested. An investment in common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund, which are generally are traded on a securities exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. These securities will fluctuate in value, and an investor in the fund may lose some or all of his or her investment, even after accounting for any reinvestment of dividends and distributions. An issuer of securities held by the fund may default, have its credit rating downgraded, or otherwise perform poorly.
The Fund’s quarterly distributions may be from net investment income, capital gains or return of capital. The distribution rate and income amounts reflect past amounts distributed and may not be indicative of future rates or income amounts. Distribution rates and income amounts can change at any time.
Closed-end fund shares are not redeemable, but instead are traded in the secondary market on an exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. They frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. Specialized funds may carry additional risks.
