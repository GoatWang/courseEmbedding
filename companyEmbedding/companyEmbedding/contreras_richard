I couldn’t find anyone to buy it so I decided to flip the house. I hired a contractor who never did any work. I heard about Armando Montelongo from one of his TV shows and watched a lot of people flipping properties. I watched all of his episodes, took a bunch of notes, then realized I was ready to flip the house. I hired a new contractor and flipped the house and made $30,000.00. Fast forward to 2015 I heard about his real estate training program. It was going to be $1,500.00. No one believed that this was a good thing, everyone told me it was a waste of time, but I’d made $30,000.00 just from watching Armando’s TV show! So, I went and was totally blown away.What was undeniable was how much I learned in those first three days of the seminar that I decided to go to the bus tour. Everyone told me that was just their way of upselling me into spending more money, but I knew it was the only way I was going to get out of the rat race. The bus tour was everything and beyond. I ate up all the information, I took pages and pages of notes. It was an amazing experience. When I get back home I knew I had the education I needed to get going. I realized I needed to take the wholesaling class to be more prepared to get going.I spent all summer after that hustling. My first deal was $10,000.00, my next deal was $5,000.00. I realized that I needed a good realtor so I could see them without delay and get comps, etc., but after working with a few, I realized it would be best if I became a Realtor so I could acquire and sell the properties I flip myself.. so that's what I did. Armando Montelongo literally changed my life.Armando Montelongo CompanyJeree S. ratedI went to the free seminar and signed up for the program, however, due to my work I was never able to get away to the next part.  Wow, working so hard, with no days off... 2 years went by so fast!  One day I was feeling pretty regretful about not being able to follow through and attend.  So I was REALLY happy when they called me within weeks of that and offered me another opportunity to get involved!  I jumped at the chance. I was going to get to that meeting in Sacramento no matter what and it was powerful. I couldn't imagine going back home to my same life and not being a part of the team and life changing opportunity. I went on the Bus Tour Training and other trainings and it's been an absolutely fantastic decision.  There is a lot of information and Armando is well versed in a multitude of learning techniques, including keeping it fun, and therefore, easier for the information to become a part of you. He listens and values his students, putting a lot of effort into making sure we are successful by providing ongoing trainings, plus almost daily real time online trainings AND all the hands on help you could ask for by his superb team.  Since the bus tour, I have taken other trainings, also.  Armando has also provided crucial support in other related areas like Asset Protection.  It is such a positive and caring organization.  Friends and family know what I am doing and are excited and are involved and supportive in various ways, referring properties to me, as well as, people who need help.  I know that with this program you can be guaranteed that the outcome is equal to the effort you put into it. I believe you cannot ask for more than that. I’m very satisfied with the training and I would highly recommend it as the best there is ever.Armando Montelongo CompanyJeffrey K. ratedI first heard about Armando Montelongo in January of 2016 through an internet ad. It caught my attention because I had just gotten my real estate license in New York. I had recently left 20  years of being a facility and construction manager in Manhattan. I went to the free event in my area and from there to the three-day seminar. This even was where I thought Armando's people help you decide if you are ready to commit to the next level of investment. The presentation was about changing your mindset. Clearly everyone there wanted to be successful, but they help you determine if you are ready to change your habits so that you can be successful. They helped us understand if you're sitting on the fence, whether you're ready to move on to the next level. Chris Sanders was probably the most dynamic speaker who had the ability to electrify the room. He taught us about the rule of 72 which opened my eyes to how long it would take for the money in my 401K to double. I realized that I needed to do something different.I did the bus tour that April in Dallas, and Master Mentor in May. The bus tour was kind of a party atmosphere which I think helps people learn how to break down barriers with strangers. In the end it was the bus tour which helped me really understand the flip process. Another valuable aspect of the Armando program is the Facebook group where we can connect and speak a common language about real estate.  I went back to San Antonio for asset protection, and I think that is all the training I've done with them so far. I've put some bids out on foreclosures and online auctions.Armando Montelongo CompanyJavier O. ratedI did my first flip a few years ago before I had any knowledge or experience in Real Estate, but we managed to make about $40,000 from it. So I was interested in learning more, thinking that if I can do that without knowing very much imagine what I could do with some real training. When I saw the infomercial for Armando Montelongo’s program on TV I decided this would be a good way to go.I went to the 1 day free event with my wife, I was ready to get into it and she was a little bit hesitant. It was very informative and it was something that I was very interested in. My wife started to become more and more interested at that point and we went to the bus tour together in Scottsdale, Arizona. The bus tour was very encouraging, I didn’t expect all the energy, but it made it very exciting to learn. It goes from morning until night, not just 8-5, non-stop energy. We made some great friends at the event who we stayed friends with to this day. We do a monthly meetup in Arizona that we oversee, we get anywhere from 20-30 people at those meetings. Now my wife is fully on board, in fact she’s the one who signed us up for the training on commercial deals. We’ve been working on a couple of deals and this weekend were finalizing our first wholesale deal.The support we received from the mentors has been top notch. You just have to reach out and they are there. There’s a ton of support, they don’t just give you the information and then it’s done. You can always call and get help which is huge for us. I’m now doing this full time, and in a few months my wife will be full time as well.Armando Montelongo CompanyJustin S. ratedI heard about Armando Montelongo’s program on late-night television back in 2012. I have been interested in getting involved in real estate for over 30 years and thought it was time to get started in it. The three-day event was phenomenal, the speakers were clear and enthusiastic. The material was fairly new to me, although I do have a background in construction. I had always wanted to flip houses, but had never considered the possibility of passive income. The bus tour was next and again, great information and the ability to see it in person while walking through the houses. One of my main takeaways was the systematic approach that Armando takes. There really isn’t any guesswork involved. You keep in mainstream and simple, you leave your emotions out of it. I keep updated with Armando’s webinars and have kept in touch with some of the people I’ve met along the way. Since the bus tour one of my big push was finding an investor. I was able to see that the people I know who have of money understand that it takes money to invest and that they are likely to be interested in working together.  I’ve worked with a lot of millionaires and I worked up the courage to ask them to invest with me. Now I’ve done 25 wholesale deals, 30-40 flips, and now I have 26 rentals. It kind of amazes me. I literally spent everything I had to go through this training because I knew it was exactly what I wanted to do. If you simply take action and follow the system you’ll be successfulArmando Montelongo CompanyJulie E. ratedI heard about Armando Montelongo's real estate program from an infomercial and was very interested in it. I have a background in real estate and wanted to learn more. I had just aquired my first rental property at the time and was interested in having more rentals for the income. The speakers at the three-day event were absolutely wonderful. They seemed to have done what they were teaching which made it feel more doable. The bus tour was great, I liked it a lot. I'm not very outgoing so the party, jump up and down atmosphere was different for me. I did ok with it though, although I enjoyed going through the houses more. Seeing the houses and applying the system to them was great education. They broke us up into teams and had some friendly competition. I guess they are trying to help people like me who are more introverted and to get comfortable with networking. The support that I've received from Armando's group has been incredible. I've been working with a mentor who is there to help in any way I need. I was working on a deal and my mentor was with me every step of the way. He spent so much time with me, he was able to work with me on my computer remotely and was out of this world in his help. I've also taken the Master Mentor three-day class. I think the Master Mentors class was the best investment out of all the Armando courses. I've been working on a couple of deals so far and feel that soon something will go through. I would recommend this program.Armando Montelongo CompanyGina R. ratedI first heard about Armando’s program back in 2016 from an infomercial. We were in the middle of an investment when we saw the program. We went to the one-day event which caught my attention and we went to the three-day event. We learned that there are so many different directions to take this program. There are people out there with money looking to invest, and there are people who are ready to invest in properties, but need funding. We learned that we had options because we are a stable couple who have a lot of people who trust us and who would work with us.We took the bus tour in Orlando, Florida. Knowing that we would have support after we left the bus tour was huge. There was so much to learn, we knew we would need follow up afterward. The bus tour was just awesome! I don’t have the best memory in the world, but the fact that the speeches and information is stuck in my brain because of the way that he taught. It was the enthusiasm and the chance we had to go experience it. Going through the houses was a way to connect what we had been learning. We’ve made many connections with our local people and are able to work together with them. We’ve done the Master Mentors and have kept up with the webinars. We just bought our twelfth house, we have one cash flow property, but we’re mostly flipping. We used hard money on one deal out of those twelve but the rest has been private funding.Armando Montelongo CompanyLisa marie S. ratedI found out about Armando Montelongo last December (2016). I had been up late at night and saw something on Facebook about Armando. My husband and I had been thinking about flipping houses and since it was a free seminar I thought why not? My husband works in construction and I’m studying for my real estate license so it made sense for us. The training was a very enlightening experience, they know their business. Informative, energetic, awesome experience. It was good enough that we decided to do the bus tour in January, in Dallas, Texas. It was a little crazy on the bus tour, but it was a lot of fun. Educational and fun at the same time. Armando is an amazing individual. He’s up front and honest, and so far, everything he’s told us has been true. It’s all been a great experience. If you don’t put skin in the game you won’t get it done. I’ve been talking with people in the wolf pack. I just sold my personal home and we purchased a new home. The whole buying and closing simultaneously was crazy, but our education helped immensely with the process. Armando’s teachings helped us decide what to pay to have someone else do the work on the house instead of doing it all ourselves. Besides the bus tour we’ve done Asset Protection, Tax Lien, Master Mentors, and in June will be doing Cash Flow. Support from Armando’s company has been amazing. Tremendous individuals ready to help.Armando Montelongo CompanyGus J. ratedMy wife and I were looking for an opportunity to learn about real estate when we saw Armando on TV talking about his free seminar. We did that and also the three-day seminar. It was informative, there wasn't any type of pressure to buy anything, they just gave a lot of information. The presenters seemed to be talking from experience. We went down to Miami for the bus tour because we felt that there was still some information that we needed that we didn't get at the three-day seminar. The education we had at the bus tour was phenomenal. The energy levels were great and it felt like a family. It was enjoyable, all questions were answered, we had a great time and got the best educational experience we've ever had. We've went to a Long Island meeting a while back and met some people who also do the program, who we've kept in touch with. We still do the webinars and conference calls, those are the things we're still doing with the Armando Montelongo program. We have completed one flip and the process went well. Things work a little bit differently in New York so once we were acclimated to how things run here it was fine. We're now looking to find another property to flip. Phenomenal support from mentors when we need it, they helped talk me through the deal. Their help relieved the little bit of anxiety that I had and helped me to make the deal.Armando Montelongo CompanyJessica R. ratedMy business partner and I had never done anything involving real estate before, but his father told us we should check this out so we decided to attend Armando Montelongo’s free event based on his recommendation. We went on to the 3-day event as I was interested in doing something different than my 9-5 job. I was attracted to the idea of working for myself and having freedom as well as endless opportunities that are available in real estate. The speakers shared their experiences and success stories which I very much could relate to. I felt that because they didn’t come from a real estate background, and they were doing it, we could too.They got us really hyped up at the bus tour and got us to think differently about life and your potential. My main take-away was that you shouldn’t limit yourself. They broke it out for us how simple it is, yet at the same time a challenge to flip houses. I’ve joined a couple of local groups in Dallas to keep in touch and network with other people that Armando has trained. We've even had a few folks that we've met at these trainings stop by to visit with us while they're in our city and have had the pleasure of showing them some of our houses...since we have flipped 11 houses so far! We’ve done pretty much all of the trainings available and have been highly satisfied with his system!Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
