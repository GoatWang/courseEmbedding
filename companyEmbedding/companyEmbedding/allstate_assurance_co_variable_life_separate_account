Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity.

that keeps on giving.

With Lifely Term, your family will receive monthly payments for a term you choose, up to 30 years.
These steady payments can help your family manage their budget, much like your paycheck does now.
 
Here’s an example of how Lifely Term can work.





Meet Alex Age: 34 Married w/2 kids




Where Alex fits in

Income $70/k a year




Life without Alex 
Alex’s family needs $4k a month to manage the bills so that his wife can continue to care for the kids as planned.




Goal To support his family after he’s gone. Alex wants to provide enough to pay the mortgage and everyday expenses until the children are out of school.




How Lifely Term can help 
With Lifely Term, Alex can provide $4k a month for 20 years, to help support his family during what would have been his working years.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Separate Accounts

Last Updated 7/11/17
A “separate account” is a fund held by a life insurance  company that   is maintained separately from the insurer's general assets.  Separate   accounts were originally established in response to federal securities    laws for investment-linked variable annuities.   Although it took many years, the  application of separate accounts has   dramatically expanded beyond this simple  product design. Product   development has resulted with an array of “hybrid”  products—products   that overlay traditional insurance company guarantees (e.g.,  mortality,   morbidity, etc.) being allocated to the separate account investment    portfolio.
The use of separate accounts by insurers has evolved rapidly  over the   past 20 years. In response to recommendations to clarify information    pertaining to separate account products, and related separate account   assets,  detailed information is available in the statutory financial   statements:

Distinct filings for       separate products that are   “insulated” or “not insulated” from the general       account creditors.   When completing the insulated separate account filing,       the   reporting entity is only to include those assets that are legally         insulated by state law or statute, in which the state law provides legal         protection to the separate account contract holder from the   general       account liabilities. 
Detailed information on       the characteristics of   separate account assets, specifically categorizing       separate   account assets in accordance with the following characteristics: 
          
Identification of        separate account assets   legally insulated and those which are not legally        insulated.   Identification is also required for all separate account        assets   not reported at fair value, and the measurement basis used for          those separate account assets. 
Amount of separate        account assets that   represent seed money, other fees and expenses due to        the general   account and additional required surplus amounts. (Additional          required surplus is defined as additional or permanent surplus that is          required to be retained in the separate account in accordance with   state        law or regulations.) Information is reported on any   current year        transfers to the separate account for seed money, as   well as the duration        in which seed money, other fees and   expenses, and additional required        surplus amounts due to the   general account have been held in the separate        account. 
Identification of        separate account assets in   which the investment directive is not        determined by the contract   holder. Situations in which the investment        directive is not   determined by the contract holder also require        disclosure on   whether the investments, if included in the general        account,   would have resulted with the reporting entity exceeding any          general account investment limitations. 
Identification of        separate account assets in   which less than 100% of investment proceeds        are attributed to the   contract holder. This also includes identification        of the   separate account investment income attributed to the reporting          entity during the reporting period, and whether the income was          transferred to the general account or reinvested within the separate          account. 
Identification of all        products reported as a   separate account product under statutory        accounting principles,   and whether the product was classified differently        under U.S.   GAAP. For products with different classifications between          statutory accounting and U.S. GAAP, identification of the   characteristics        that resulted with a different classification   under U.S. GAAP.


Information on separate account products with general    accounting guarantees, including the amount of guarantees paid by the   general  account for the current reporting year, and for the previous   four reporting  years. This information also details the risk charges   paid from the separate  account to the general account related to these   guarantees, and whether the  risk charges are reviewed and opined upon.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the Commission.
Applicants' Representations
1. Allstate is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Illinois in 1957. Allstate's home office is located at 3100 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062. Allstate is licensed to operate in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except New York. Allstate is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate Insurance Company, a stock property-liability insurance company incorporated under the laws of Illinois. All of the outstanding capital stock of Allstate Insurance Company is owned by The Allstate Corporation.
2. Allstate established Allstate Separate Account I and Allstate VL Account (“Allstate Separate Accounts”) as separate accounts pursuant to Illinois law. Each is a “separate account,” as defined by Section 2(a)(37) of the Act, and is registered with the Commission pursuant to the Act as a unit investment trust.
3. Certain variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts sponsored by Allstate and issued through Allstate Separate Accounts (“Allstate contracts”) are registered with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”).
4.  Allstate Separate Account I is divided into 146 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of an open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the Act (the “Funds”). Allstate VL is divided into 19 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds.
5. Glenbrook is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Arizona in 1998. Previously, Glenbrook Life was organized under the laws of the State of Illinois in 1992. Glenbrook Life was originally organized under the laws of the State of Indiana in 1965. From 1965 to 1983 Glenbrook Life was known as “United Standard Life Assurance Company” and from 1983 to 1992 as “William Penn Life Assurance Company of America.” Glenbrook's home office is located at 3100 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062. Glenbrook is currently licensed to operate in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except New York. Glenbrook is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate Life Insurance Company.
6. Glenbrook established Glenbrook Multi-Manager, Glenbrook Separate Account A, and Glenbrook VL Account (collectively, the “Glenbrook Separate Accounts”) as separate accounts pursuant to Illinois law, and the Separate Accounts are currently subject to Arizona law following Glenbrook's redomestication to Arizona in 1998. Each is a “separate account,” as defined by Section 2(a)(37) of the Act, and each is registered with the Commission pursuant to the Act as a unit investment trust.
7. Certain variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts sponsored by Glenbrook and issued through the Glenbrook Separate Accounts are registered with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act.
8. Glenbrook Multi-Manager is divided into 97 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio the Funds. Glenbrook Separate Account A is divided into 36 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds. Glenbrook VL Account is divided into 63 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds.
9. Allstate and Glenbrook have determined to engage in transactions whereby Glenbrook will be reorganized with and merged into Allstate, with Allstate as the surviving corporation (such transactions, collectively, the “Merger”). By resolutions dated August 3, 2004 and August 4, 2004, a Merger Agreement and Articles of Merger (collectively “Agreement”) were approved and adopted by the respective boards of directors of Allstate and Glenbrook. Prior approval of the Merger and the Agreement also will be obtained from the insurance departments of Illinois and Arizona, the states of domicile for Allstate and Glenbrook, respectively.
10. On the effective date of the Merger: (a) Allstate will assume ownership of all the assets of Glenbrook, including all the assets held in the Glenbrook Separate Accounts; (b) Allstate will conduct the business presently conducted by Glenbrook, and will be responsible for satisfaction of all of the liabilities and obligations of Glenbrook; and (c) Glenbrook will cease to exist as a separate corporate entity. Allstate will then control the merged separate accounts supporting the Contracts.
11. After considering the nature and purpose of each separate account, the Boards of Directors of Allstate and Glenbrook have determined that the efficiency of the operations of the separate accounts could be improved, and the overall administration enhanced, by merging: (a) Glenbrook Multi-Manager and Glenbrook Separate Account A into Allstate Separate Account I; and (b) Glenbrook VL Account into Allstate VL Account. The Merger will be structured so there will be no change in the rights and benefits of persons having an interest in any of the Contracts issued by those Separate Accounts. Moreover, the Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Contracts, nor will the Merger affect the values determined under the Contracts. Allstate will be responsible for the expenses incurred in connection with the Merger.
12. The consolidation of any overlapping sub-accounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each Glenbrook Contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging sub-accounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving sub-account. The values of the exchanged interests under the Contracts will thus be equivalent. The accumulation unit values for these sub-accounts will not change, and the Contract value of any affected Contract owner immediately after the sub-account consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the sub-account consolidation.
13. The Merger provides for the transfer of Glenbrook Multi-Manager and Glenbrook Separate Account A assets to Allstate Separate Account I and the assumption of the liabilities and contractual obligations of each of Glenbrook Multi-Manager and Glenbrook Separate Account A by Allstate Separate Account I in return for the crediting of accumulation units of Allstate Separate Account I to Glenbrook Multi-Manager and Start Printed Page 68985Glenbrook Separate Account A contract owners. Once this process has been completed, the units of Glenbrook Multi-Manager and Glenbrook Separate Account A would be cancelled, Glenbrook Multi-Manager and Glenbrook Separate Account A would each submit an application to the Commission pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Act to effect its deregistration as an investment company and would cease to exist, and Allstate Separate Account I would continue to exist.
14. Immediately following the Merger, each Glenbrook Multi-Manager and Glenbrook Separate Account A contract owner will possess a number of Allstate Separate Account I units (both full and fractional) that, when multiplied by the unit value of Allstate Separate Account I units, would result in an aggregate unit value equal to the aggregate unit value of the units the contract owner had in the respective Separate Account immediately before the consummation of the Merger.
15. The Merger also provides for the transfer of Glenbrook VL Account assets to Allstate VL Account and the assumption of the liabilities and contractual obligations of Glenbrook VL Account by Allstate VL Account in return for the crediting of accumulation units of Allstate VL Account to Glenbrook VL Account contract owners. Once this process has been completed, the units of Glenbrook VL Account would be cancelled, Glenbrook VL Account would submit an application to the Commission pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Act to effect its deregistration as an investment company and would cease to exist, and Allstate VL Account would continue to exist.
16. Immediately following the Merger, each Glenbrook VL Account contract owner will possess a number of Allstate VL Account units (both full and fractional) that, when multiplied by the unit value of Allstate VL Account units, would result in an aggregate unit value equal to the aggregate unit value of the units the contract owner had in the respective Separate Account immediately before the consummation of the Merger.
17. Upon the effective date of the Merger, Allstate will succeed to all of the business and operations of Glenbrook, including the obligations pursuant to the Glenbrook contracts. Allstate will distribute to each existing Glenbrook contract owner: (a) A contract rider indicating that such contracts are thereafter funded by the surviving separate account; (b) a letter informing such contract owners of the Merger; and (c) prospectus disclosure that reflects Allstate's sponsorship of the surviving separate account as a result of the merger.
18. Allstate and Glenbrook assert that the Merger will have no tax consequences for Glenbrook contract owners. In addition, no payments will be required or charges imposed under the Glenbrook contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a) of the Act provides generally that it is unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal to knowingly purchase or to sell any security or other property from or to such registered company.
2. Section 17(b) of the Act provides generally that the Commission may grant an order exempting a transaction otherwise prohibited by Section 17(a) of the Act if evidence establishes that: (a) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
3. The Merger may be subject to the provisions of Section 17(a) of the Act because it could be viewed as involving an investment company (Glenbrook Multi-Manager, Glenbrook Separate Account A, Glenbrook VL Account) selling its assets to another investment company (Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate VL Account) that is affiliated by reason of having sponsoring insurance companies that are under common control, or by reason of having common directors.
4. Applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to Section 17(b) of the Act to the extent necessary to exempt the Merger from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the Act.
5. Applicants assert that the terms of the Merger are fair and reasonable.  The transfer of assets held by Glenbrook Multi-Manager, Glenbrook Separate Account A and Glenbrook VL Account respectively, will be made at the relative net asset values of the sub-accounts.  Consequently, the interests of Allstate Separate Account I and Allstate VL Account owners will not be diluted by the Merger.  Each Glenbrook Multi-Manager and Glenbrook Separate Account A contract will be credited, immediately after the Merger, with units of Allstate Separate Account I having the same aggregate value as the aggregate value of the units of Glenbrook Multi-Manager and Glenbrook Separate Account A credited to such contract immediately prior to the Merger.  Likewise, each Glenbrook VL Account contract will be credited, immediately after the Merger, with units of the Allstate VL Account having the same aggregate value as the aggregate value of the units of Glenbrook VL Account credited to such contract immediately prior to the Merger.  The Merger will not result in any change in charges, costs, fees or expenses borne by any Contract owner.  No direct or indirect costs will be incurred by any Separate Account concerned as a result of the Merger.  Therefore, the proposed transactions will not result in dilution of the economic interests of any Contract owners.  In addition, the Merger will result in no change in the investment options available to Glenbrook contract owners.  Each sub-account of the Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger.
6. The consolidation of any overlapping sub-accounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each Glenbrook Contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging sub-accounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving sub-account.  The values of the exchanged interests under the Contracts will thus be equivalent.  The accumulation unit values for these sub-accounts will not change, and the Contract value of any affected Contract owner immediately after the sub-account consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the sub-account consolidation.
7. Applicants assert that the Merger does not involve overreaching on the part of any party involved and is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.  The purposes of the Merger are to consolidate three variable annuity separate accounts, each of which issue variable annuity contracts, into a single separate account and to consolidate two variable life separate accounts, each of which issue variable life contracts, into a single separate account.  The Merger will allow for administrative efficiencies and cost savings by Glenbrook because it can consolidate its separate account operations.  The Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Glenbrook contracts, nor will the Merger affect the values determined under the Glenbrook contracts.  Allstate will pay all expenses incurred in connection with the merger.Start Printed Page 68986

8. Applicants represent that the Merger is consistent with the policy of each Separate Account as set forth in its registration statement.  The policy of each Separate Account is to invest in the Funds.  As noted above, the Merger will result in no change to any Fund underlying the Glenbrook Separate Accounts.  Each sub-account of the Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger.  Accordingly, the assets underlying the Contracts will continue to be invested in accordance with the policies recited in the Separate Accounts' respective registration statements.
Conclusion
For the reasons summarized above, Applicants assert that the terms of the Merger, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, are consistent with the policies of the Glenbrook Separate Accounts as recited in their registration statements, are consistent with the general purposes of the Act, and therefore meet the conditions for exemptive relief established by Section 17(b).

Allstate Life Insurance Company: No-Action Letter dated December 23, 2002
















Home | Previous Page






























No-Action Letter under
Securities Act of 1933 - Sections 5 and 8
Allstate Life Insurance Company
December 23, 2002
Reponse of the Office of Insurance Products
Division of Investment Management
Allstate Life Insurance Company, et al.
Based on the facts and representations in your letter dated December 23, 2002 and in an application for an exemptive order under Sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), and without necessarily agreeing with your legal analysis, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against Allstate Life Insurance Company ("Allstate"), Northbrook Life Insurance Company ("Northbrook") or Morgan Stanley DW Inc. under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act,"), if the Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A (the "Northbrook Life Separate Account") is transferred to Allstate, where it will change its name to Allstate Life Separate Account A, in connection with the proposed merger of Northbrook into Allstate (the "Merger").  We also would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder, or Section 11 of the 1940 Act, if the Northbrook Variable Annuity Account and Northbrook Variable Annuity Account II (the "Northbrook VA Accounts") are merged with Allstate Financial Advisors Separate Account I ("Allstate Separate Account I") (the "Separate Account Mergers") in connection with the Merger.  In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if (1) the change in depositor of the Northbrook Life Separate Account as a result of the Merger is effected though the filing of an amendment to the registration statement for the Northbrook Life Separate Account under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements under the 1933 Act are filed by Allstate, the Northbrook Life Separate Account and Allstate Separate Account I to cover any securities issued after the Merger in connection with variable life insurance contracts funded by the Northbrook Life Separate Account and any variable annuity contracts funded by Allstate Separate Account I.
Further, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder if, without registration under the 1933 Act, Northbrook transfers to Allstate assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under certain fixed annuity contracts with market value adjustment features, as a result of which Allstate would assume all of the obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under such contracts.
In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if, after consummation of the Merger, Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Separate Account A (formerly Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A), and the other parties named in the exemptive orders cited in your letter, continue to rely on such orders without filing amended or new applications for the same relief previously granted.
Because our position is based on facts and representations in your letter, you should note that different facts or representations may require a different conclusion. Further, this response expresses the position of the Division on enforcement only, and does not purport to express any legal conclusions on the issues presented.
Alison Toledo
Senior Counsel


[Foley:Lardner Attorneys at Law letterhead]

December 23, 2002
1933 Act/Section 5 and Rule 145
1940 Act/Sections 8 and 11
BY HAND DELIVERY
William J. Kotapish, Esq.
Assistant Director
Office of Insurance Products
Division of Investment Management
Securities and Exchange Commission
450 Fifth Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20549-0506
Re:  Allstate Life Insurance Company,
Northbrook Life Insurance Company, and
Morgan Stanley DW Inc.
Dear Mr. Kotapish: 
We are writing on behalf of Allstate Life Insurance Company ("Allstate"), Northbrook Life Insurance Company ("Northbrook"), and Morgan Stanley DW Inc. ("MSDW") to request that the staff advise us that it would not recommend enforcement action to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in connection with the merger of Northbrook into its parent, Allstate (the "Merger"), described below.  This letter replaces our letter to you of August 30, 2002, and reflects changes agreed upon with the Commission staff.
Specifically, Allstate, Northbrook, and MSDW are seeking the staff's assurances that it would not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action:
under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), if Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A ("Northbrook Life Separate Account") is transferred intact to Allstate, as described below (the "Separate Account Transfer"); 
under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder or Section 11 of the 1940 Act if Northbrook Variable Annuity Account ("Northbrook VA") and Northbrook Variable Annuity Account II ("Northbrook VA II," together with Northbrook VA, the "Northbrook VA Accounts") merge with Allstate Financial Advisors Separate Account I ("Allstate Separate Account I") and consolidate any duplicative sub-accounts ("consolidated sub-accounts"), as described below (the "Separate Account Mergers"); 
under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder if, with respect to certain market value adjustment contracts (the "Northbrook MVA Contracts"),  Northbrook transfers to Allstate assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts, and Allstate assumes all the obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under such Contracts, as described below (the "Fixed Account Transfer"); and  
after consummation of the Merger, if Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, and certain others described herein continue to rely on the exemptive orders identified herein obtained on behalf of Northbrook, the Northbrook  Separate Accounts, and any other parties named therein without the filing or submission of amended or new applications for the same exemptive relief.
The Merger, Separate Account Transfer, Separate Account Mergers, and Fixed Account Transfer comprise the "Proposed Transactions," as referred to herein. 
I. Facts
Representatives of the companies involved have advised us of the facts set out below.
A. Allstate
Allstate is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Illinois in 1957.  Allstate's home office is located at 3100 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062. Allstate is licensed to operate in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except New York.  Allstate currently has two registered separate accounts one of which, as described  below, will be involved in the Proposed Transactions.  At December 31, 2001, Allstate had approximately $44 billion in general and separate account assets on a statutory basis. 
Allstate is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate Insurance Company, a stock property-liability insurance company incorporated under the laws of Illinois. All of the outstanding capital stock of Allstate Insurance Company is owned by The Allstate Corporation. 
Allstate is the depositor of Allstate Separate Account I.
B. Northbrook
Northbrook is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Arizona in 1998.  Previously, from 1978 to 1998, Northbrook was organized under the laws of the State of Illinois. Northbrook's headquarters are located at 3100 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062. Northbrook is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate.  Northbrook is currently licensed to operate in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except New York.  Northbrook currently has four registered separate accounts that are described below. At December 31, 2001, Northbrook had approximately $6.4 billion in general and separate account assets on a statutory basis.  
Northbrook and Allstate entered into a reinsurance agreement effective December 31, 1987. Under the reinsurance agreement, Allstate reinsures all of Northbrook's liabilities under its annuity and life insurance contracts.
Northbrook is the depositor of the Northbrook VA Accounts and the Northbrook Life Separate Account.
C. Separate Accounts and Contracts
Allstate Separate Account I was created pursuant to Illinois law and is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.1 Units of interest in Allstate Separate Account I are registered under the 1933 Act.2  Allstate Separate Account I funds two Allstate variable annuity contracts ("Allstate Contracts"). The Allstate Contracts are currently offered for sale in all states where Allstate is licensed. 
The Northbrook VA Accounts and the Northbrook Life Separate Account (collectively, the "Northbrook Separate Accounts") were created under Arizona law and each is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.3   The Northbrook VA Accounts fund six variable annuity contracts ("Northbrook VA Contracts"), and Northbrook Life Separate Account funds one variable life insurance contract ("Northbrook VLI Contract," and, together with the Northbrook VA Contracts and the Northbrook MVA Contracts, the "Northbrook Contracts"). Units of interest in each Northbrook Separate Account are registered under the 1933 Act.4 
All of the Northbrook Contracts are currently offered for sale in all states where Northbrook is licensed, with the exception of the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity, the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity II, and the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity II AssetManager.5   The Northbrook VA and VLI Contracts generally permit additional payments and allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.
The above separate accounts consist of sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a portfolio of an open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the 1940 Act (each, an "Underlying Fund," collectively, the "Underlying Funds").  Currently, Allstate Separate Account I consists of 59 sub-accounts, Northbrook Life Separate Account consists of 20 sub-accounts, Northbrook VA consists of 11 sub-accounts, and Northbrook VA II consists of 53 sub-accounts. Several of the sub-accounts available under the Northbrook VA Contracts and the Allstate Contracts invest in the same Underlying Funds; however, those sub-accounts each have different accumulation unit values due to the different charges imposed under those Contracts.  Each of the Allstate Contracts and Northbrook Contracts also offer one or more general account options that are not registered under the 1933 Act. 
D. Northbrook MVA Contracts
The Northbrook MVA Contracts are flexible premium deferred fixed annuity contracts that are offered to individuals and to eligible groups. They have no variable investment options.  Northbrook holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the Northbrook MVA Contracts in a non-unitized separate account that is not registered under the 1940 Act.  Market value adjustment interests in the Northbrook MVA Contracts are registered under the 1933 Act.6
E. Underwriter 
MSDW, a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., is the principal underwriter for the Northbrook Contracts.  MSDW was organized under the laws of Delaware in 1968.  MSDW is registered with the Commission under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
II. The Proposed Transactions
A. The Merger
Northbrook will merge with and into Allstate, with Allstate as the surviving corporation, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Articles of Merger (collectively, the "Merger Agreement") approved by the Boards of Directors of Allstate and Northbrook.  The Merger is subject to approval by the insurance departments of Arizona and Illinois, the states of domicile for Northbrook and Allstate, respectively.  Allstate and Northbrook expect to consummate the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, and the Fixed Account Transfer, on or about January 1, 2003 (the "Effective Date").
As a result of the Merger, Allstate will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of the Northbrook Separate Accounts and will become directly liable for Northbrook's liabilities and obligations with respect to the Northbrook Contracts then outstanding.7  Each Northbrook Contract owner will become a contract owner of Allstate by operation of law.  The Merger will not affect the provisions of, or the rights and obligations under, the Northbrook Contracts. Moreover, the Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Northbrook Contracts, nor will the Merger affect the values determined under the Northbrook Contracts.  The Merger will not affect any current Allstate Contract owners.
No charges will be imposed on, or other deductions made from, the Northbrook Separate Accounts or Allstate Separate Account I in connection with the Merger.  In addition, no payments will be required or charges imposed under the Northbrook Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed.8
No new investment options will be made available to owners of the Northbrook Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger, nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated. Each sub-account of the Northbrook Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Underlying Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger. 
The Merger will not directly affect any of the Underlying Funds. The Underlying Funds will not be a party to the Merger or any related transaction. The investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of the Underlying Funds will not be changed as a result of the Merger or any related transaction.   No investment portfolios are proposed to be added to, substituted by, or terminated by the Underlying Funds in connection with the Merger or any related transaction.  Moreover, the Merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the Underlying Funds, the Underlying Funds' assets, or the charges imposed on the Underlying Funds or their shareholders.  In addition, the Merger will not result in a change in the principal underwriter for the Northbrook Contracts. 
Allstate and Northbrook have determined that no provision of the Northbrook Contracts or state law provides the owners of those Contracts ("Northbrook Contract owners") with any right to opt-out of, or to vote on or otherwise consent to, the Merger. Rather, the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies.  Moreover, none of the events affecting the Northbrook Separate Accounts in connection with the Merger require a vote of Northbrook Contract owners under the 1940 Act. In addition, as described above, the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the Northbrook Contracts will not change, except that Allstate will become the depositor of the Northbrook Separate Accounts. Consequently, Northbrook Contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the Merger.   
After the Merger, Allstate intends to accept additional payments under the transferred Northbrook Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected, and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the Northbrook Contracts currently being offered, but for the change in depositor.  Allstate will administer the Northbrook Contracts in the same manner as did Northbrook immediately prior to the Merger. 
All costs of the Merger will be borne by Allstate or an affiliate and not by any owners of Northbrook or Allstate Contracts (each, a "Contract owner," and collectively, the "Contract owners"). 
B. The Separate Account Transfer
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Northbrook Life Separate Account will transfer intact to Allstate and become part of Allstate on the Effective Date.  It will change its name to Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and have Allstate as its depositor rather than Northbrook. No other changes to Northbrook Life Separate Account will result from the Merger.  
The assets and liabilities that comprise Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately prior to the Merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of Allstate, as the surviving company, after the Merger.  In addition, Northbrook Life Separate Account will continue to fund the same Contracts it did immediately prior to the Merger. 
C. The Separate Account Mergers
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Northbrook VA Accounts will merge with Allstate Separate Account I on the Effective Date.  To achieve administrative efficiencies and cost savings, Allstate will consolidate any duplicative sub-accounts that invest in the same Underlying Fund. 
The consolidation of the sub-accounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each Northbrook Contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging sub-accounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving sub-account.9   The values of the exchanged interests under the Contracts will thus be equivalent.  The accumulation unit values for these sub-accounts will not change, and the Contract value of any affected Contract owner immediately after the sub-account consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the sub-account consolidation. 
The Separate Account Mergers will not affect the sub-accounts of the Northbrook Separate Accounts that are not duplicative.  Those sub-accounts will remain intact within Allstate Separate Account I and their net asset values immediately after the Merger will be the same as they were immediately before the Merger.  
D. The Fixed Account Transfer
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Northbrook will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts to Allstate, and Allstate will assume Northbrook's obligations under such Contracts, on the Effective Date. As a result of the Merger,  each non-unitized separate account of Northbrook that funds the Northbrook MVA Contracts will become a non-unitized separate account of Allstate. At the same time, Allstate will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of Northbrook and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of Northbrook under the Northbrook MVA Contracts issued prior to the Merger. 
The Fixed Account Transfer will not change the terms of the Northbrook MVA Contracts, except for the succession of Allstate as the insurer under the Northbrook MVA Contracts, and it will not adversely affect the values determined under, or the economic interests of the owners of, those Contracts. 
E. Procedural Matters
Allstate will file new registration statements on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable, under the 1933 Act to reflect the change in depositor of the Northbrook Separate Accounts and Allstate's assumption, pursuant to the Merger, of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Northbrook under the Northbrook VA Contracts and Northbrook VLI Contract. Allstate will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date.  Existing Northbrook Contract owners (other than Northbrook VLI Contract owners) will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects Allstate's sponsorship of the Northbrook Separate Accounts as a result of the Merger.  New Contract owners will receive a revised prospectus that reflects the change in depositor.  Northbrook VLI Contract owners will receive a new Form N-6 prospectus that reflects the change in depositor.
Allstate also will file new registration statements on Form S-3 under the 1933 Act for the Northbrook MVA Contracts.  Allstate will seek to have the registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date. These new registration statements would reflect Allstate's assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Northbrook with respect to the Northbrook MVA Contracts pursuant to the Merger.  Each person who owns a Northbrook MVA Contract at the time of the Fixed Account Transfer will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects Allstate as the issuer of the Contract.  New Contract owners will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer.
In compliance with applicable state law, Allstate, and Northbrook will notify the owners of the Northbrook Contracts that Allstate has assumed all obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under those Contracts.
Following the Effective Date, Allstate will not make offers or accept purchase payments under the Northbrook Contracts until the new registration statements filed with the Commission are effective.
III. Discussion
For the reasons discussed below, we are of the view that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder do not apply to the Proposed Transactions.  We also are of the view, as discussed below, that Section 8 of the 1940 Act does not apply to the Separate Account Transfer, and that Section 11 of the 1940 Act does not apply to the Separate Account Transfer or the Separate Account Mergers.  Finally, we are of the view that the exemptive relief previously granted to Northbrook and other named parties prior to the Merger10 may continue to be relied upon after the Merger by Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and the other named parties without the need for the filing or submission of amended or duplicative exemptive applications. 
The staff has responded favorably to no-action requests dealing with the provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act noted above regarding transactions similar to the Separate Account Transfer,11 the Separate Account Mergers,12  and the Fixed Account Transfer.13 We respectfully submit that the Proposed Transactions are analogous to and pose no different issues than those presented in the transactions described in those no-action requests.
A. Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder Do Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, or the Fixed Account Transfer
1. Separate Account Transfer
In our view, the Separate Account Transfer would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder.   
The Separate Account Transfer would not change the Northbrook VLI Contracts, except that, by operation of law, Allstate would succeed Northbrook as the depositor of Northbrook Life Separate Account and co-issuer of the Contracts and would, accordingly, guarantee the rights and benefits provided by the Contracts.14 These rights and benefits (e.g., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) would remain the same but would be guaranteed directly by Allstate's larger pool of assets. Cash values under the Northbrook VLI Contracts that are allocated to the Northbrook Life Separate Account would remain funded by the same pool of assets that presently constitutes the Separate Account, and its sub-accounts would continue to invest in the same Underlying Funds.  The unit values under the Northbrook VLI Contracts offered by Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A immediately after the Separate Account Transfer would be the same as under the Contracts offered by Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately before. The Separate Account Transfer, therefore, would not affect those aspects of the Northbrook VLI Contracts that cause interests thereunder to be treated as securities, e.g., the investment options available through the Separate Account.
The Separate Account Transfer would have no effect on the Northbrook Life Separate Account, except for the succession of Allstate as depositor and co-issuer described above, and except for the change in name of that Separate Account to Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A. The assets and liabilities that comprise the Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately before the Separate Account Transfer would remain intact and legally segregated from all other business of Allstate.   The financial history of the Northbrook Life Separate Account would be carried forward, and, with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by Allstate, would not change. 
As discussed above, Contract owners will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, and will not, by virtue of the Merger, have available any new or different investment options. Consequently, Contract Owners will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the Separate Account Transfer.  
Based on the foregoing, we believe that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 14515 thereunder do not apply to the Separate Account Transfer. 
2. Separate Account Mergers
In our view, the Separate Account Mergers would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder.   
The Separate Account Mergers would not result in any change to the Northbrook VA Contracts, except that Allstate would succeed Northbrook as depositor and as co-issuer of the Contracts. The rights and benefits under the Northbrook VA Contracts would remain the same, all of the sub-accounts of the Northbrook VA Accounts would continue to invest in the same Underlying Funds, the Northbrook VA Contract values immediately following the Merger will be the same as immediately before, and Contract owners would not be asked to make a new investment decision, since their vote or consent is not required in connection with the Merger. 
The change in depositor following the Merger does not change the nature of the securities outstanding.  The identity of the depositor is relevant to investors primarily because the depositor makes guarantees that are in the nature of insurance obligations. For example, the depositor, in effect, guarantees to make up any shortfall in separate account assets to pay any death benefit, notwithstanding that the benefit might be greater than the amount of account value supporting the contract in question, and to make annuity payments for whatever period is contractually required, regardless of whether the relevant contract's account value has already been depleted thereby.  We respectfully submit, therefore, that the difference in depositors is a difference that relates almost exclusively to the insurance guarantees under the Northbrook Contracts, rather than to those aspects of the Contracts that constitute (or cause the Contracts to be) securities. This argues strongly against the conclusion that the existence of a different depositor necessarily gives rise to a different security.  
Moreover, even if the Separate Account Mergers were deemed to involve the issuance of  new or different securities, such issuance would not be registrable under the terms of Section 5 or Rule 145, because Contract owners do not have any discretion about whether or not to participate in the Separate Account Mergers.  Accordingly, the Contract owners will not be called upon to make the kind of investment decision that historically has been deemed necessary for an "offer" or "sale" to occur that would bring Section 5 into play.  Nor, in this case, will there be the kind of security holder action that, under the terms of the rule, is required to bring Rule 145 into play.
3. Fixed Account Transfer 
In our view, the Fixed Account Transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act.
No change will be made to the Northbrook MVA Contracts by virtue of the Fixed Account Transfer, except that Allstate will succeed Northbrook as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the Northbrook MVA Contracts. These rights and benefits (i.e., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) will remain the same.  Northbrook will transfer its non-unitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts intact to Allstate. Consequently, when the Fixed Account Transfer becomes effective, Allstate will hold these assets in the same non-unitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer.
As discussed above, owners of Northbrook MVA Contracts will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Fixed Account Transfer and will not, by virtue of the Fixed Account Transfer, have available any new or different investment options. Consequently, owners of Northbrook MVA Contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the Fixed Account Transfer.
B. Section 8 of the 1940 Act Does Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer
In our view, the succession of Allstate to the position of depositor for the Northbrook Life Separate Account as a result of the Merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act.   
The Merger will cause a change in the depositor of the Northbrook Life Separate Account, which will involve a change in the co-issuer of the units of interest under variable life insurance contracts funded through that Separate Account.  However, the change in depositor will not change the structure or operation of the Northbrook Life Separate Account or its relationship to the insurance company issuing the Northbrook VLI Contracts or to the Contract owners.  The Northbrook Life Separate Account would continue to be treated as a separate entity for all relevant purposes, including financial reporting.  
The Commission's "ectoplasmic" theory,16 in our view, supports the position that Northbrook Life Separate Account, as such, will have a continuing, uninterrupted existence, notwithstanding the change of the insurance company serving as its depositor and having legal ownership of its assets. Although the assets of Northbrook Life Separate Account will become assets of Allstate, such assets will remain intact in a legally separate account, and, for financial reporting purposes, the Separate Account will be treated as a continuing separate entity. 
Accordingly, to reflect the change in legal ownership of the assets of the Northbrook Life Separate Account from Northbrook to Allstate following the consummation of the Merger, Allstate and the Separate Account will file a new registration statement on Form N-6 that will constitute an amendment to the Separate Account's existing registration under the 1940 Act.  The Form N-6 registration statement also will register, under the 1933 Act, any securities transactions effected under the Northbrook VLI  Contracts after the Merger.  Allstate will file the Form N-6 registration statement to ensure that it will become effective on or about the effective date of the Merger. 
C. Section 11 of the 1940 Act Does Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer and the Separate Account Mergers
Based on the foregoing analysis, we also believe that the Separate Account Transfer does not involve an exchange of securities (the separate account interests in the Northbrook VLI Contracts) issued by an investment company (the Northbrook VLI Separate Account) for securities of any other investment company for purposes of Section 11 of the 1940 Act.   In addition, for the reasons discussed above, we believe that the Separate Account Mergers do not involve an "offer of exchange" within the meaning of Section 11.   However, should the Separate Account Transfer or the Separate Account Mergers be viewed as including an offer of exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of Section 11, we believe that such transactions would comply with the requirements of Section 11(a) and Rule 11a-2(b)(2) thereunder, because any such exchange would be effected at relative net asset values. Thus, Commission approval of such transactions should not be required under Section 11 of the 1940 Act. 
D. Continued Reliance on Prior Exemptive Relief Is Appropriate
We believe the exemptions under the 1940 Act17 that Northbrook, the Northbrook Separate Accounts, and the other parties named therein have received from the Commission or its staff should continue to apply after the Merger to Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and other parties named therein, to the extent they continue to be relied upon, without the filing with the Commission of amended or duplicative applications for the same relief.  Their continued applicability is appropriate because the Merger will not change the operations of Allstate Separate Account I, nor its relationship to its depositor, any other separate account, or Contract owners.  The only changes  resulting from the Merger are: (i) the substitution of Allstate for Northbrook as depositor for the Northbrook Separate Accounts and as co-issuer and insurer of the Northbrook Contracts, (ii) the transfer of the sub-accounts of the Northbrook Separate Accounts to Allstate Separate Account I, (iii) the transfer of Northbrook Life Separate Account to Allstate, and (iv) the consolidation of the transferred sub-accounts that invest in the same Underlying Funds.  It is our view that such changes have no impact upon, and are not relevant to, the exemptions that were previously granted or the justifications for those exemptions.  In support of our view, we note that the Commission staff has taken a favorable position on similar requests in several no-action letters.18
IV. No-Action Request
Based upon the above facts and circumstances, we respectfully request that the Commission staff issue a letter stating that it will not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder in connection with the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, and the Fixed Account Transfer, or under Section 8 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Separate Account Transfer, and Section 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Separate Account Transfer and the Separate Account Mergers.
In addition, we request that the staff advise us that the exemptive orders cited herein, to the extent they continue to be relied upon, will continue to be applicable after the Effective Date, in the manner described above, to Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and to the parties named therein without the filing of amended or duplicative applications for the same exemptions for the same assurance.
If you have any questions or require further information with respect to this matter, please call me, Chip Lunde (202-295-4016), or Charles Smith of Allstate (847-402-1790).
Very truly yours,

Even if the Merger were deemed to be a "transfer of assets" for purposes of Rule 145, it is clear that the Rule does not apply because the Contract owners are not being asked to vote on or to consent to the transaction. For these reasons, we believe that Rule 145 is inapplicable to the Merger.

Response of the Office of Chief Counsel
Division of Corporation Finance



Re: 
Allstate Life Insurance Company
Incoming letter dated August 21, 2002



Based on the facts presented, the Division will raise no objection if Allstate Life's registration statement on Form 10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is incorporated by reference into a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 filed by Allstate Life pursuant to General Instruction I.C.2 of Form S-3.

Further, so long as The Allstate Corporation directly or indirectly owns all of the outstanding common stock of Allstate Life, the Division will not recommend enforcement action if: 
(1) Allstate Life does not file proxy or information statements pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act with respect to its common stock; 
(2) Allstate Life's officers, directors and beneficial holders do not file reports with respect to Allstate Life's common stock under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act; 
(3) holders of Allstate Life's common stock do not file reports under Section 13(d) or 13(g) of the Exchange Act with respect to their holdings of Allstate Life common stock; and 
(4) the filing requirements under Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act are not complied with in connection with transactions involving the common stock of Allstate Life.
If Allstate Life registers another class of its securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, then Allstate Life, its shareholders and The Allstate Corporation should comply with all of the requirements imposed as a result of registration of that class.

These positions are based on the representations made to the Division in your letter.  Any different facts or conditions might require the Division to reach different conclusions.  Further, 

this response only represents the Division's position on enforcement action and does not purport to express any legal conclusion on the questions presented.

Re: Allstate Life Insurance Company
Dear Ms. Dubberly:
We are writing on behalf of our client, Allstate Life Insurance Company ("Allstate Life"), an Illinois stock life insurance company, to seek no-action assurances from the Commission staff regarding the matters described below.  This letter replaces our letter to you of April 23, 2002 on behalf of Allstate Life regarding essentially the same matters, responds to comments we received on July 3, 2002, from Jonathan A. Ingram of your office, and reflects changes agreed upon in the undersigned's telephone conversation of August 15, 2002, with Amy M. Starr of your office.  Seven copies of this letter are enclosed for the Commission staff's reference.
A.  FACTS
Allstate Life is wholly-owned by Allstate Insurance Company ("Allstate Insurance"), an Illinois stock insurance company, which, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Allstate Corporation ("Allstate Corporation"), a Delaware corporation.  Allstate Corporation is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") (File No. 001-11840).  It conducts its business principally through Allstate Insurance, Allstate Life and their subsidiaries.
Allstate Life is planning to publicly offer three new deferred annuity contracts ("Contracts") on or about October 1, 2002.1 The Contracts offer, among other features, several investment options to which Contract owners may allocate purchase payments, including:

(a)  variable sub-accounts that invest in mutual fund shares and that fund contract benefits that vary depending on the performance of the mutual funds ("Variable Sub-Accounts");2
(b)  investment options funded by Allstate Life's general or "fixed" account that provide contract benefits at fixed interest rates; and 
(c)  a "Market Value Adjustment Account" investment option, which offers a fixed rate of return if held to maturity or, if not held to maturity, a rate of return subject to a market value adjustment ("MVA") under the circumstances described below.

Our request with respect to the Contracts only relates to the Market Value Adjustment Account feature of the Contracts.3
The Market Value Adjustment Account is divided into "Guarantee Period Accounts."  A new Guarantee Period Account is established each time the Contract owner allocates a purchase payment or transfers funds to the Market Value Adjustment Account.  The owner selects the term of the Guarantee Period Account from those offered, which may range from one to ten years.  Interest is earned at a fixed rate declared at the time the Guarantee Period Account is established.  Assets in the Market Value Adjustment Account are part of Allstate Life's general account; they are held in "non-unitized" separate accounts4 within the general account.
All amounts credited under the Market Value Adjustment Account, including accrued interest, will be guaranteed by Allstate Life so long as those amounts are held until the respective maturity dates of the Guarantee Period Accounts.  Amounts credited under the Guarantee Period Accounts that are used prior to maturity for withdrawals, transfers and death benefit payments, or applied to income plan payouts that begin outside the 30-day period described below, will, however, be subject to an upward or downward MVA. An MVA will not apply to such amounts during the 30-day period after the term of a Guarantee Period Account expires.  The MVA reflects changes in the current level of interest rates from those established at the beginning of the Guarantee Period Account.5
Allstate Life proposes to file a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "MVA Registration Statement") under the Securities Act, pursuant to General Instruction I.C.2., of Form S-3 to register the Market Value Adjustment Account interests ("MVA Interests").6, 7  However, unlike its ultimate parent, Allstate Corporation, Allstate Life has not previously been required to file a Form 10-K annual report that could be incorporated by reference into a FormS-3 prospectus.  Accordingly, Allstate Life voluntarily filed a Form 10 registration statement (the "Form 10") to register its common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act on April 24, 2002.  The Form 10 became effective on June 23, 2002, pursuant to the provisions of Section 12(g).
B.  DISCUSSION AND REQUEST FOR NO-ACTION ASSURANCES
In connection with the foregoing, we now are writing with respect to the following matters.

1.  Incorporation by Reference of Form 10 in Form S-3 Prospectuses
Allstate Life is in the process of preparing the MVA Registration Statement, to register the MVA Interests.  The MVA Interests will be offered on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, as is typical of such insurance product offerings.  Consistent with filings made by other registrants, Allstate Life proposes to incorporate by reference its Form 10 in the prospectuses to be included in the MVA Registration Statement.8
Except as may be discussed with the Commission's staff, Allstate Life has no current plans to register on Form S-3 any other investment grade securities under the Securities Act.
After the filing of Allstate Life's first Form 10-K annual report, in March 2003, Allstate Life's updated Form S-3 prospectuses, commencing May 1, 2003, will incorporate by reference its Form 10-K and no longer incorporate the Form 10.  The incorporation by reference of the Form 10 is, thus, an interim measure that is necessary only because Allstate Life has not previously been required to file reports under the Exchange Act.  Allstate Life will, of course, also become subject to those reporting requirements, pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, upon the effectiveness of the MVA Registration Statement.
In the foregoing circumstances, we request your confirmation that it will be acceptable for a prospectus contained in a Form S-3 filed by Allstate Life to incorporate by reference Allstate Life's Form 10, and that the staff will not recommend any action to the Commission if Allstate Life proceeds in such fashion.

2.  Sections 13(d), 13(e), 13(g), 14 and 16(a)
The registration of Allstate Life's common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act technically imposes certain requirements on Allstate Life, its officers, directors and shareholders under Sections 13(d), 13(e), 13(g), 14, and 16(a) of the Exchange Act.  These requirements are designed to protect the holders of equity securities registered under Section 12(g).  However, so long as all of Allstate Life's outstanding common stock is owned by Allstate Corporation, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, such protection is unnecessary, and the disclosure and reporting requirements of such Sections would have no meaningful application.  Compliance with the provisions of those Sections would only result in increased cost and regulatory burden to Allstate Life, with no public benefit.
We therefore propose that so long as all of Allstate Life's outstanding common stock is owned by Allstate Corporation, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries:(a) Allstate Life will not file proxy or information statements pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act; (b) the officers, directors and shareholders of Allstate Life will not file reports with respect to Allstate Life common stock under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act; (c) the shareholders of Allstate Life will not file reports under Section 13(d) or 13(g) of the Exchange Act with respect to holdings of Allstate Life common stock; and (d) Allstate Life will consider Section 13(e) of the Exchange Act to be inapplicable to transactions involving its common stock.
We request your confirmation that the staff will not recommend any action to the Commission if Allstate Life and its officers and directors and shareholders proceed as outlined in the immediately preceding paragraph.  We note that the staff has responded favorably to similar requests in analogous situations.  See Duke Energy Corporation and Duke Capital Corporation, NationsBank Corporation and GE Global Insurance Holding Corporation cited above; see also, Pacific Gas Transmission Company (May 11, 1995), Mission Energy Company (Nov. 4, 1994), and Ford Holdings Inc. (Feb. 8, 1990).
If you have any questions concerning this letter or require additional information, please call the undersigned at 202.295.4019, or Richard T. Choi of this firm at 202.295.4005.

Footnotes
1  Like all deferred annuity contracts issued by life insurance companies, the Contracts are insurance contracts that confer upon Contract owners certain rights and benefits in accordance with their terms and conditions and applicable state insurance laws.  The Contracts are designed to enable Contract owners to accumulate earnings for retirement, savings, and other long-term investment purposes.
2  The Variable Sub-Accounts are investment divisions of Allstate Life's Separate Account A, a unit investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (File No. 811-09227) ("Separate Account A").  Units of interest ("units") of Separate Account A are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") pursuant to three separate registration statements on Form N-4 (File Nos. 333-72017, 333-31288, and 333-96115) (the "Form N-4 Registration Statements").   Units of Separate Account A to be issued in connection with the Contracts are the subject of post-effective amendments to the Form N-4 Registration Statements ("Form N-4 Amendments") that are scheduled to become effective on September 6, 2002.
3  The MVA Interests will be the subject of a Form S-3 registration statement, which will give rise to Exchange Act reporting obligations.  The relief requested has no application either to the Variable Sub-Accounts (interests in which are registered on Form N-4) or the other fixed account options (which are not registered).
4  A "non-unitized" separate account is a separate account established by an insurance company under state insurance law.  However, unlike the typical separate account that supports variable benefits under an insurance product, there are no "units" of interest issued by a "non-unitized" separate account, which is maintained as part of the insurance company's general account.
5  For example, if the interest rate applicable to an outstanding three-year Guarantee Period is 7% and the rate offered for a new three-year Guarantee Period is 5% at the time of a withdrawal, an MVA would apply to the withdrawn amount to give effect to the difference in interest rates.
6  The MVA Interests will, of course, be non-convertible "investment grade securities," as defined in General Instruction I.B.2. of Form S-3.  At the time of the sale of the Contracts, the MVA Interests will have been rated by "at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization . . . [that will have] rated the [MVA Interests] security in one of its generic rating categories which signifies investment grade; typically, the four highest rating categories . . . signify investment grade."  For this purpose, Allstate Life will submit copies of the Contracts and other information to a rating agency in accordance with customary procedures.
7  The MVA Interests are part of the Contracts.  Accordingly, the MVA Registration Statement will include the same prospectuses as are contained in the Form N-4 Amendments for the Contracts.  Both the MVA Registration Statement and the Form N-4 Amendments will be reviewed by the staff of the Division of Investment Management.  A copy of this letter is being sent to William J. Kotapish, Esq., Assistant Director, Office of Insurance Products, of that Division for his information.
8  See, for example, the Form 10 incorporated by reference in the prospectuses contained in the Form S-3 registration statement of The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States ("Equitable Life") filed on January 17, 1995 under the Securities Act to register market value adjustment interests under annuity contracts.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

The corporate spokesperson is Dennis Haysbert.

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

^ In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

The corporate spokesperson is Dennis Haysbert.

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

College football[edit]
Allstate sponsors branded field goal nets at over 67 colleges and universities. For each field goal and extra point kicked, Allstate donates into collegiate general scholarship funds. To date, those donations exceed $2.9 million. Allstate also sponsors branded nets during field goals and extra points at over 20 college bowl games, including the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the BCS National Championship Game.
Additionally, Allstate is a partner of the Southeastern Conference and its 20 sports, including football.[24]
Sugar Bowl[edit]
Since 2007, Allstate has been the title sponsor of the Sugar Bowl, one of the four games that make up the Bowl Championship Series. The game is played at the Louisiana Superdome, which is also the home of the New Orleans Saints. Allstate is also a sponsor of the New Orleans Saints.

Allstate Wrigleyville Classic[edit]
The Northwestern Wildcats and the Illinois Fighting Illini played a collegiate football game at Wrigley Field on November 20, 2010. It was the first football game at Wrigley Field since 1970 and the first collegiate football game at Wrigley Field since 1938 when DePaul University played its regular games at Wrigley.[9] Allstate title sponsored this game.[25]

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

The Allstate Corporation is the second largest personal lines insurer in the United States (behind State Farm) and the largest that is publicly held. The company also has personal lines insurance operations in Canada. Allstate was founded in 1931 as part of Sears, Roebuck and Co., and was spun off in 1993.[4] The company has had its headquarters in Northfield Township, Illinois, near Northbrook since 1967.[5][6] Its current advertising campaign, in use since 2004, asks, "Are you in good hands?" The corporate spokesperson is Dennis Haysbert.

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

^ In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
