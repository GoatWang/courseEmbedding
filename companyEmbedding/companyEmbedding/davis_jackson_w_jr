Early life[edit]
William Harding Jackson was born on March 25, 1901 on the Belle Meade Plantation, in Belle Meade, Tennessee near Nashville, Tennessee. His father of the same name was William Harding Jackson (1874-1903), and his mother, Anne Davis Richardson (1877-1954) (later remarried to Maxwell Stevenson of Hempstead, New York).[3]
Jackson attended the Fay School in Boston and St. Mark's School, an Episcopal Preparatory school in Southborough, Massachusetts. He received his undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree (B.A.) from Princeton University (1924) and his LL.B. from Harvard Law School (1928).[1]
Career[edit]
In 1928, Jackson joined the New York law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. In 1929 he became an Associate of Beekman & Bogue. Following the stock market crash of 1929, Jackson moved to the business and financial interest law firm of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, where he became a full partner in 1934.[4]
During World War II, Jackson served in the United States Army (from 6 March 1942 – 7 July 1945) as an intelligence officer where he graduated from the Army-Air Force (USAAF) Air Combat Intelligence School at Harrisburg PA. He was assigned as an A-2 Assistant Intelligence officer, HQ 1st Bomber Command at 90 Church St in New York (close to his law office), which immediately became the USAAF Anti-Submarine Command. William Harding Jackson was the principal author (along with investment banker Alexander Standish and Harold B. Ingersoll) of the USAAF Bay of Biscay Intelligence Estimate, calling for the attack on Nazi U-boats at their source on the coast of France. This was a significant turning point for the Battle of the Atlantic. After graduation from Harrisburg in June 1942 Jackson was promoted to Major and brought into the War Department by Sec. Henry L. Stimson where he became General Staff - Chief of Secret Intelligence reporting to Gen. George C. Marshall from the European Theater of Operations (ETO) at COSSAC headquarters - with the 'cover' title Chief of G-2 intelligence for 1st Army Group (FUSAG). After training on the Enigma codes at Bletchley Park UK he became the senior ULTRA SCIU team leader for all US armies in the ETO.[5]
Jackson achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was assigned by Gen. Hap Arnold to the planning staff of Brig. Gen. Harold George who had just taken over the USAAF Air Transport Command. He was listed as the Adjutant General for the ATC European Wing that ferried more than 7,000 US aircraft to Britain during WW-II. He received recognition for work rebuilding or expanding air fields in the UK for American aircraft and creating an expanded communications network for top secret secured communications (again, with Standish and Ingersoll). By summer of 1943, he was given the 'cover title' Assistant Attache for Air, stationed at the US Embassy under Ambassador Gil Winant near Grosvenor Square, next to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Shortly, thereafter he was promoted to full colonel and appointed G-2 intelligence chief at 1st Army Group (FUSAG) headquarters in London's West End to work on Operation Bodyguard, the massive deception plan to make the Nazis believe the D-Day assault (Operation Overlord) would come from Scandinavia in the north and at Pas-de-Calais under the command of Gen. George S. Patton, at the narrowest point of the English Channel. He worked closely with Gen. T. J. Betts, Deputy G-2 SHAEF and then Colonel Edwin L. Sibert ('G-2') at Headquarters, 1st Army located in Bristol.
After the successful D-Day feint, Jackson was made head of all OSS X-2 Special Counter-Intelligence Units (SCIU) in the ETO, traveling with 12th Army Group's forward EAGLE TAC headquarters to Luxembourg on General Omar Bradley's staff.[6] During the "Battle of the Bulge" in Dec-Jan 1945 (in addition to his duties with ULTRA and SCIU teams) on January 1, 1945 during the middle of heated battle, Jackson was named Deputy G-2 for all US armies at 12th Army Group.[7]
Decorations—For service to his country and the people of Europe, Jackson was awarded the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit with 1-OLC, the Belgian Crois de Guerre and is believed to be the only US Army officer below the rank of general to receive both the French Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre with Palm.




CIA Change of Command - 7 October 1950 - (Front Row L to R) Incoming Deputy Director William Harding Jackson, incoming Director Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, outgoing Director Adm. Roscoe Hillenkoetter


Prior to discharge from the Army and OSS, Jackson was assigned the task of studying the British Secret Intelligence Service. The study took four months working in London with MI-5, MI-6 and Sir Anthony Eden to complete a report for Gen. Marshall and Gen. Donovan on June 14, 1945. Subsequently, on November 14, 1945 at the request of then SecNav James Forrestal, William Harding Jackson submitted his own plan for a new central intelligence agency as an alternative to General Donovan's plan.[8]
After World War II, Jackson resigned from Carter, Ledyard & Milburn to become an investment banker and the 'Managing Partner' (1947-1955) for J.H. Whitney & Co. of New York.[9]
In 1948, George F. Kennan proposed that control over the government's directorate for political warfare should be "answerable" to the Secretary of State, suggesting that "one man must be boss;" and suggesting further, that the Director of Central Intelligence and the Agency should get "...out of the business of covert psychological operations..." Kennan took the discussion to Allen W. Dulles, then in private law practice in New York, thinking Dulles would be the logical choice to head the new agency at State. Some believe this started an inter-agency squabble over just "whom" would control intelligence among the military-industrial and civilian intelligence complex. National Security Council executive director, Adm. Sidney Souers, appointed Jackson on February 13 to serve on the NSC's "Intelligence Survey Group" with Allen Dulles and Mathias Correa (an aide to then Sec. of Defense James Forrestal) for the purpose of analyzing departmental practices and inter-agency coordination. The Survey Group, known as the Dulles, Jackson, Correa Committee or Dulles Group, submitted its final report on February 28, 1949. It was a scathing criticism of CIA and its operations under Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, which resulted in the removal of several key persons at CIA and, eventually, the removal of Hillenkoetter.[2]
On July 18, 1950 the new Sec. of Defense, Louis Johnson and Gen. Omar Bradley sent a letter to President Truman nominating William Harding Jackson for Director of Central Intelligence to replace Hillenkoetter. Having known of Jackson's background, Truman penned a short note at the bottom of the letter and sent it to his White House aide, Donald S. Dawson, saying "...Don: Let's look into this. Tell Mr. [Averell] Harriman what we are doing. If this works out, we'll forget Gen. Smith."[10]
General Walter Bedell Smith did not want the job of DCI and tried to beg off on health issues, repeatedly. When Jackson declined because of philanthropic and business commitments in New York, Truman is said to have all but issued a direct order as commander-in-chief to General Smith, that he would become the next DCI. Smith then turned to Bill Jackson as his nominee for Deputy Director of Central Intelligence to reorganize the Agency - with particular emphasis on covert activities, psychological warfare, and building a professional career Agency.
Jackson was appointed Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency on August 18, 1950, and sworn-in October 7. He was the first Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI) to serve under former Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1945–46) and former World War II four-star General, Walter Bedell Smith (DCI). Smith and Jackson brought Allen W. Dulles to CIA under contract as Deputy Director/Plans (clandestine activities) in early 1951. After completing the reorganization in accordance with adoption of the Dulles Report and NSC-50, and Jackson's resignation in August 1951, Allen Dulles was promoted to DDCI to replace Jackson, later, replacing Smith as DCI in 1953. Jackson remained a contract special adviser to the DCI through both the Smith and Dulles directorships. During the Eisenhower Administration, Bill Jackson is listed by the 'White House Staff' publication[11] and by the CIA as being a 'Special Adviser' and 'Senior Consultant to the Director of Central Intelligence' (from 1951–1955).
In 1953, Jackson was appointed Chairman of President Eisenhower's Committee on International Information Activities, often known inside the Beltway as the Jackson Committee (1953-1954) which led to creation of the US Information Agency (USIA). In December 1955 Jackson resigned from J. H. Whitney & Co. and was named 'Special Assistant to the Secretary of State' John Foster Dulles to attend the 1955 Big Four talks in Geneva.[12] In February 1956 Jackson was appointed special assistant to President Eisenhower on psychological warfare, succeeding Nelson Rockefeller.[13] Jackson served briefly as United States National Security Adviser from September 1, 1956 until January 7, 1957.
Personal life[edit]
Jackson's first wife, Elizabeth Lyman (married 1929) was the ex-wife of Thomas Rice of Dover; she brought two children Thomas Rice, Jr. and Lyman Rice to their marriage. Jackson and Elizabeth had two more sons, William Harding Jackson, Jr. and Richard Lee Jackson. They divorced in 1946 after Jackson returned from World War II.
At age 39, Jackson was elected the youngest president to serve (1940-1949) on the board of directors of The Society of the New York Hospital, one of America's oldest hospitals founded by King George III in 1771, and was nominated to the National Academy of Sciences.[14] After the war, Jackson was elected to the boards of Bankers Trust, the John Hay Whitney Foundation, the New York Hospital for Special Surgery, and the Menninger Foundation.
In 1951, Jackson married Mary Pitcairn, the daughter of Norman B. Pitcairn, a former president of the Wabash Railroad.[15] They had two sons together: Bruce P. Jackson and Howell E. Jackson. After they divorced, around 1965, Keating married another New York lawyer, Wendell Davis, who died in 1972. She married a third time to U.S. Senator and former Ambassador to Israel, Kenneth Keating; thus, becoming Mary Pitcairn Jackson Davis Keating.[8]
Death[edit]
Jackson died on September 28, 1971 in Tucson, Arizona at age 71.[1] He is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

CIA Change of Command - 7 October 1950 - (Front Row L to R) Incoming Deputy Director William Harding Jackson, incoming Director Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, outgoing Director Adm. Roscoe Hillenkoetter


Prior to discharge from the Army and OSS, Jackson was assigned the task of studying the British Secret Intelligence Service. The study took four months working in London with MI-5, MI-6 and Sir Anthony Eden to complete a report for Gen. Marshall and Gen. Donovan on June 14, 1945. Subsequently, on November 14, 1945 at the request of then SecNav James Forrestal, William Harding Jackson submitted his own plan for a new central intelligence agency as an alternative to General Donovan's plan.[8]
After World War II, Jackson resigned from Carter, Ledyard & Milburn to become an investment banker and the 'Managing Partner' (1947-1955) for J.H. Whitney & Co. of New York.[9]
In 1948, George F.

It was a scathing criticism of CIA and its operations under Director Roscoe H.

During the Eisenhower Administration, Bill Jackson is listed by the 'White House Staff' publication[11] and by the CIA as being a 'Special Adviser' and 'Senior Consultant to the Director of Central Intelligence' (from 1951–1955).
In 1953, Jackson was appointed Chairman of President Eisenhower's Committee on International Information Activities, often known inside the Beltway as the Jackson Committee (1953-1954) which led to creation of the US Information Agency (USIA).

Personal life[edit]
Jackson's first wife, Elizabeth Lyman (married 1929) was the ex-wife of Thomas Rice of Dover; she brought two children Thomas Rice, Jr. and Lyman Rice to their marriage. Jackson and Elizabeth had two more sons, William Harding Jackson, Jr. and Richard Lee Jackson. They divorced in 1946 after Jackson returned from World War II.
At age 39, Jackson was elected the youngest president to serve (1940-1949) on the board of directors of The Society of the New York Hospital, one of America's oldest hospitals founded by King George III in 1771, and was nominated to the National Academy of Sciences.[14] After the war, Jackson was elected to the boards of Bankers Trust, the John Hay Whitney Foundation, the New York Hospital for Special Surgery, and the Menninger Foundation.
In 1951, Jackson married Mary Pitcairn, the daughter of Norman B. Pitcairn, a former president of the Wabash Railroad.[15] They had two sons together: Bruce P. Jackson and Howell E. Jackson. After they divorced, around 1965, Keating married another New York lawyer, Wendell Davis, who died in 1972. She married a third time to U.S. Senator and former Ambassador to Israel, Kenneth Keating; thus, becoming Mary Pitcairn Jackson Davis Keating.[8]
Death[edit]
Jackson died on September 28, 1971 in Tucson, Arizona at age 71.[1] He is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

White House - 1 March 1956 - William Harding Jackson, US National Security Adviser and President Dwight D. Eisenhower


William Harding "Wild Bill" Jackson Jr. (March 25, 1901 – September 28, 1971) was a U.S. civilian administrator, New York lawyer, and investment banker who served as Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[1][2] Jackson also served briefly under President Dwight D. Eisenhower as United States National Security Adviser in 1956 while in his role as Special Assistant for National Security Affairs from 1956 to 1957.

Early life[edit]
William Harding Jackson was born on March 25, 1901 on the Belle Meade Plantation, in Belle Meade, Tennessee near Nashville, Tennessee. His father of the same name was William Harding Jackson (1874-1903), and his mother, Anne Davis Richardson (1877-1954) (later remarried to Maxwell Stevenson of Hempstead, New York).[3]
Jackson attended the Fay School in Boston and St. Mark's School, an Episcopal Preparatory school in Southborough, Massachusetts. He received his undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree (B.A.) from Princeton University (1924) and his LL.B. from Harvard Law School (1928).[1]
Career[edit]
In 1928, Jackson joined the New York law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. In 1929 he became an Associate of Beekman & Bogue. Following the stock market crash of 1929, Jackson moved to the business and financial interest law firm of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, where he became a full partner in 1934.[4]
During World War II, Jackson served in the United States Army (from 6 March 1942 – 7 July 1945) as an intelligence officer where he graduated from the Army-Air Force (USAAF) Air Combat Intelligence School at Harrisburg PA. He was assigned as an A-2 Assistant Intelligence officer, HQ 1st Bomber Command at 90 Church St in New York (close to his law office), which immediately became the USAAF Anti-Submarine Command. William Harding Jackson was the principal author (along with investment banker Alexander Standish and Harold B. Ingersoll) of the USAAF Bay of Biscay Intelligence Estimate, calling for the attack on Nazi U-boats at their source on the coast of France. This was a significant turning point for the Battle of the Atlantic. After graduation from Harrisburg in June 1942 Jackson was promoted to Major and brought into the War Department by Sec. Henry L. Stimson where he became General Staff - Chief of Secret Intelligence reporting to Gen. George C. Marshall from the European Theater of Operations (ETO) at COSSAC headquarters - with the 'cover' title Chief of G-2 intelligence for 1st Army Group (FUSAG). After training on the Enigma codes at Bletchley Park UK he became the senior ULTRA SCIU team leader for all US armies in the ETO.[5]
Jackson achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was assigned by Gen. Hap Arnold to the planning staff of Brig. Gen. Harold George who had just taken over the USAAF Air Transport Command. He was listed as the Adjutant General for the ATC European Wing that ferried more than 7,000 US aircraft to Britain during WW-II. He received recognition for work rebuilding or expanding air fields in the UK for American aircraft and creating an expanded communications network for top secret secured communications (again, with Standish and Ingersoll). By summer of 1943, he was given the 'cover title' Assistant Attache for Air, stationed at the US Embassy under Ambassador Gil Winant near Grosvenor Square, next to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Shortly, thereafter he was promoted to full colonel and appointed G-2 intelligence chief at 1st Army Group (FUSAG) headquarters in London's West End to work on Operation Bodyguard, the massive deception plan to make the Nazis believe the D-Day assault (Operation Overlord) would come from Scandinavia in the north and at Pas-de-Calais under the command of Gen. George S. Patton, at the narrowest point of the English Channel. He worked closely with Gen. T. J. Betts, Deputy G-2 SHAEF and then Colonel Edwin L. Sibert ('G-2') at Headquarters, 1st Army located in Bristol.
After the successful D-Day feint, Jackson was made head of all OSS X-2 Special Counter-Intelligence Units (SCIU) in the ETO, traveling with 12th Army Group's forward EAGLE TAC headquarters to Luxembourg on General Omar Bradley's staff.[6] During the "Battle of the Bulge" in Dec-Jan 1945 (in addition to his duties with ULTRA and SCIU teams) on January 1, 1945 during the middle of heated battle, Jackson was named Deputy G-2 for all US armies at 12th Army Group.[7]
Decorations—For service to his country and the people of Europe, Jackson was awarded the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit with 1-OLC, the Belgian Crois de Guerre and is believed to be the only US Army officer below the rank of general to receive both the French Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre with Palm.




CIA Change of Command - 7 October 1950 - (Front Row L to R) Incoming Deputy Director William Harding Jackson, incoming Director Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, outgoing Director Adm. Roscoe Hillenkoetter


Prior to discharge from the Army and OSS, Jackson was assigned the task of studying the British Secret Intelligence Service. The study took four months working in London with MI-5, MI-6 and Sir Anthony Eden to complete a report for Gen. Marshall and Gen. Donovan on June 14, 1945. Subsequently, on November 14, 1945 at the request of then SecNav James Forrestal, William Harding Jackson submitted his own plan for a new central intelligence agency as an alternative to General Donovan's plan.[8]
After World War II, Jackson resigned from Carter, Ledyard & Milburn to become an investment banker and the 'Managing Partner' (1947-1955) for J.H. Whitney & Co. of New York.[9]
In 1948, George F. Kennan proposed that control over the government's directorate for political warfare should be "answerable" to the Secretary of State, suggesting that "one man must be boss;" and suggesting further, that the Director of Central Intelligence and the Agency should get "...out of the business of covert psychological operations..." Kennan took the discussion to Allen W. Dulles, then in private law practice in New York, thinking Dulles would be the logical choice to head the new agency at State. Some believe this started an inter-agency squabble over just "whom" would control intelligence among the military-industrial and civilian intelligence complex. National Security Council executive director, Adm. Sidney Souers, appointed Jackson on February 13 to serve on the NSC's "Intelligence Survey Group" with Allen Dulles and Mathias Correa (an aide to then Sec. of Defense James Forrestal) for the purpose of analyzing departmental practices and inter-agency coordination. The Survey Group, known as the Dulles, Jackson, Correa Committee or Dulles Group, submitted its final report on February 28, 1949. It was a scathing criticism of CIA and its operations under Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, which resulted in the removal of several key persons at CIA and, eventually, the removal of Hillenkoetter.[2]
On July 18, 1950 the new Sec. of Defense, Louis Johnson and Gen. Omar Bradley sent a letter to President Truman nominating William Harding Jackson for Director of Central Intelligence to replace Hillenkoetter. Having known of Jackson's background, Truman penned a short note at the bottom of the letter and sent it to his White House aide, Donald S. Dawson, saying "...Don: Let's look into this. Tell Mr. [Averell] Harriman what we are doing. If this works out, we'll forget Gen. Smith."[10]
General Walter Bedell Smith did not want the job of DCI and tried to beg off on health issues, repeatedly. When Jackson declined because of philanthropic and business commitments in New York, Truman is said to have all but issued a direct order as commander-in-chief to General Smith, that he would become the next DCI. Smith then turned to Bill Jackson as his nominee for Deputy Director of Central Intelligence to reorganize the Agency - with particular emphasis on covert activities, psychological warfare, and building a professional career Agency.
Jackson was appointed Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency on August 18, 1950, and sworn-in October 7. He was the first Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI) to serve under former Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1945–46) and former World War II four-star General, Walter Bedell Smith (DCI). Smith and Jackson brought Allen W. Dulles to CIA under contract as Deputy Director/Plans (clandestine activities) in early 1951. After completing the reorganization in accordance with adoption of the Dulles Report and NSC-50, and Jackson's resignation in August 1951, Allen Dulles was promoted to DDCI to replace Jackson, later, replacing Smith as DCI in 1953. Jackson remained a contract special adviser to the DCI through both the Smith and Dulles directorships. During the Eisenhower Administration, Bill Jackson is listed by the 'White House Staff' publication[11] and by the CIA as being a 'Special Adviser' and 'Senior Consultant to the Director of Central Intelligence' (from 1951–1955).
In 1953, Jackson was appointed Chairman of President Eisenhower's Committee on International Information Activities, often known inside the Beltway as the Jackson Committee (1953-1954) which led to creation of the US Information Agency (USIA). In December 1955 Jackson resigned from J. H. Whitney & Co. and was named 'Special Assistant to the Secretary of State' John Foster Dulles to attend the 1955 Big Four talks in Geneva.[12] In February 1956 Jackson was appointed special assistant to President Eisenhower on psychological warfare, succeeding Nelson Rockefeller.[13] Jackson served briefly as United States National Security Adviser from September 1, 1956 until January 7, 1957.
Personal life[edit]
Jackson's first wife, Elizabeth Lyman (married 1929) was the ex-wife of Thomas Rice of Dover; she brought two children Thomas Rice, Jr. and Lyman Rice to their marriage. Jackson and Elizabeth had two more sons, William Harding Jackson, Jr. and Richard Lee Jackson. They divorced in 1946 after Jackson returned from World War II.
At age 39, Jackson was elected the youngest president to serve (1940-1949) on the board of directors of The Society of the New York Hospital, one of America's oldest hospitals founded by King George III in 1771, and was nominated to the National Academy of Sciences.[14] After the war, Jackson was elected to the boards of Bankers Trust, the John Hay Whitney Foundation, the New York Hospital for Special Surgery, and the Menninger Foundation.
In 1951, Jackson married Mary Pitcairn, the daughter of Norman B. Pitcairn, a former president of the Wabash Railroad.[15] They had two sons together: Bruce P. Jackson and Howell E. Jackson. After they divorced, around 1965, Keating married another New York lawyer, Wendell Davis, who died in 1972. She married a third time to U.S. Senator and former Ambassador to Israel, Kenneth Keating; thus, becoming Mary Pitcairn Jackson Davis Keating.[8]
Death[edit]
Jackson died on September 28, 1971 in Tucson, Arizona at age 71.[1] He is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

CIA Change of Command - 7 October 1950 - (Front Row L to R) Incoming Deputy Director William Harding Jackson, incoming Director Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, outgoing Director Adm. Roscoe Hillenkoetter


Prior to discharge from the Army and OSS, Jackson was assigned the task of studying the British Secret Intelligence Service. The study took four months working in London with MI-5, MI-6 and Sir Anthony Eden to complete a report for Gen. Marshall and Gen. Donovan on June 14, 1945. Subsequently, on November 14, 1945 at the request of then SecNav James Forrestal, William Harding Jackson submitted his own plan for a new central intelligence agency as an alternative to General Donovan's plan.[8]
After World War II, Jackson resigned from Carter, Ledyard & Milburn to become an investment banker and the 'Managing Partner' (1947-1955) for J.H. Whitney & Co. of New York.[9]

Having known of Jackson's background, Truman penned a short note at the bottom of the letter and sent it to his White House aide, Donald S. Dawson, saying "...Don: Let's look into this. Tell Mr. [Averell] Harriman what we are doing. If this works out, we'll forget Gen. Smith."[10]
General Walter Bedell Smith did not want the job of DCI and tried to beg off on health issues, repeatedly. When Jackson declined because of philanthropic and business commitments in New York, Truman is said to have all but issued a direct order as commander-in-chief to General Smith, that he would become the next DCI. Smith then turned to Bill Jackson as his nominee for Deputy Director of Central Intelligence to reorganize the Agency - with particular emphasis on covert activities, psychological warfare, and building a professional career Agency.
Jackson was appointed Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency on August 18, 1950, and sworn-in October 7. He was the first Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI) to serve under former Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1945–46) and former World War II four-star General, Walter Bedell Smith (DCI). Smith and Jackson brought Allen W. Dulles to CIA under contract as Deputy Director/Plans (clandestine activities) in early 1951. After completing the reorganization in accordance with adoption of the Dulles Report and NSC-50, and Jackson's resignation in August 1951, Allen Dulles was promoted to DDCI to replace Jackson, later, replacing Smith as DCI in 1953. Jackson remained a contract special adviser to the DCI through both the Smith and Dulles directorships. During the Eisenhower Administration, Bill Jackson is listed by the 'White House Staff' publication[11] and by the CIA as being a 'Special Adviser' and 'Senior Consultant to the Director of Central Intelligence' (from 1951–1955).
In 1953, Jackson was appointed Chairman of President Eisenhower's Committee on International Information Activities, often known inside the Beltway as the Jackson Committee (1953-1954) which led to creation of the US Information Agency (USIA). In December 1955 Jackson resigned from J. H. Whitney & Co. and was named 'Special Assistant to the Secretary of State' John Foster Dulles to attend the 1955 Big Four talks in Geneva.[12] In February 1956 Jackson was appointed special assistant to President Eisenhower on psychological warfare, succeeding Nelson Rockefeller.[13] Jackson served briefly as United States National Security Adviser from September 1, 1956 until January 7, 1957.
Personal life[edit]
Jackson's first wife, Elizabeth Lyman (married 1929) was the ex-wife of Thomas Rice of Dover; she brought two children Thomas Rice, Jr. and Lyman Rice to their marriage. Jackson and Elizabeth had two more sons, William Harding Jackson, Jr. and Richard Lee Jackson. They divorced in 1946 after Jackson returned from World War II.
At age 39, Jackson was elected the youngest president to serve (1940-1949) on the board of directors of The Society of the New York Hospital, one of America's oldest hospitals founded by King George III in 1771, and was nominated to the National Academy of Sciences.[14] After the war, Jackson was elected to the boards of Bankers Trust, the John Hay Whitney Foundation, the New York Hospital for Special Surgery, and the Menninger Foundation.
In 1951, Jackson married Mary Pitcairn, the daughter of Norman B. Pitcairn, a former president of the Wabash Railroad.[15] They had two sons together: Bruce P. Jackson and Howell E. Jackson. After they divorced, around 1965, Keating married another New York lawyer, Wendell Davis, who died in 1972. She married a third time to U.S. Senator and former Ambassador to Israel, Kenneth Keating; thus, becoming Mary Pitcairn Jackson Davis Keating.[8]
Death[edit]
Jackson died on September 28, 1971 in Tucson, Arizona at age 71.[1] He is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

White House - 1 March 1956 - William Harding Jackson, US National Security Adviser and President Dwight D. Eisenhower


William Harding "Wild Bill" Jackson Jr. (March 25, 1901 – September 28, 1971) was a U.S. civilian administrator, New York lawyer, and investment banker who served as Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.[1][2] Jackson also served briefly under President Dwight D. Eisenhower as United States National Security Adviser in 1956 while in his role as Special Assistant for National Security Affairs from 1956 to 1957.

Early life[edit]
William Harding Jackson was born on March 25, 1901 on the Belle Meade Plantation, in Belle Meade, Tennessee near Nashville, Tennessee. His father of the same name was William Harding Jackson (1874-1903), and his mother, Anne Davis Richardson (1877-1954) (later remarried to Maxwell Stevenson of Hempstead, New York).[3]
Jackson attended the Fay School in Boston and St. Mark's School, an Episcopal Preparatory school in Southborough, Massachusetts. He received his undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree (B.A.) from Princeton University (1924) and his LL.B. from Harvard Law School (1928).[1]
Career[edit]
In 1928, Jackson joined the New York law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. In 1929 he became an Associate of Beekman & Bogue. Following the stock market crash of 1929, Jackson moved to the business and financial interest law firm of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, where he became a full partner in 1934.[4]
During World War II, Jackson served in the United States Army (from 6 March 1942 – 7 July 1945) as an intelligence officer where he graduated from the Army-Air Force (USAAF) Air Combat Intelligence School at Harrisburg PA. He was assigned as an A-2 Assistant Intelligence officer, HQ 1st Bomber Command at 90 Church St in New York (close to his law office), which immediately became the USAAF Anti-Submarine Command. William Harding Jackson was the principal author (along with investment banker Alexander Standish and Harold B. Ingersoll) of the USAAF Bay of Biscay Intelligence Estimate, calling for the attack on Nazi U-boats at their source on the coast of France. This was a significant turning point for the Battle of the Atlantic. After graduation from Harrisburg in June 1942 Jackson was promoted to Major and brought into the War Department by Sec. Henry L. Stimson where he became General Staff - Chief of Secret Intelligence reporting to Gen. George C. Marshall from the European Theater of Operations (ETO) at COSSAC headquarters - with the 'cover' title Chief of G-2 intelligence for 1st Army Group (FUSAG). After training on the Enigma codes at Bletchley Park UK he became the senior ULTRA SCIU team leader for all US armies in the ETO.[5]
Jackson achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was assigned by Gen. Hap Arnold to the planning staff of Brig. Gen. Harold George who had just taken over the USAAF Air Transport Command. He was listed as the Adjutant General for the ATC European Wing that ferried more than 7,000 US aircraft to Britain during WW-II. He received recognition for work rebuilding or expanding air fields in the UK for American aircraft and creating an expanded communications network for top secret secured communications (again, with Standish and Ingersoll). By summer of 1943, he was given the 'cover title' Assistant Attache for Air, stationed at the US Embassy under Ambassador Gil Winant near Grosvenor Square, next to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Shortly, thereafter he was promoted to full colonel and appointed G-2 intelligence chief at 1st Army Group (FUSAG) headquarters in London's West End to work on Operation Bodyguard, the massive deception plan to make the Nazis believe the D-Day assault (Operation Overlord) would come from Scandinavia in the north and at Pas-de-Calais under the command of Gen. George S. Patton, at the narrowest point of the English Channel. He worked closely with Gen. T. J. Betts, Deputy G-2 SHAEF and then Colonel Edwin L. Sibert ('G-2') at Headquarters, 1st Army located in Bristol.
After the successful D-Day feint, Jackson was made head of all OSS X-2 Special Counter-Intelligence Units (SCIU) in the ETO, traveling with 12th Army Group's forward EAGLE TAC headquarters to Luxembourg on General Omar Bradley's staff.[6] During the "Battle of the Bulge" in Dec-Jan 1945 (in addition to his duties with ULTRA and SCIU teams) on January 1, 1945 during the middle of heated battle, Jackson was named Deputy G-2 for all US armies at 12th Army Group.[7]
Decorations—For service to his country and the people of Europe, Jackson was awarded the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit with 1-OLC, the Belgian Crois de Guerre and is believed to be the only US Army officer below the rank of general to receive both the French Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre with Palm.




CIA Change of Command - 7 October 1950 - (Front Row L to R) Incoming Deputy Director William Harding Jackson, incoming Director Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, outgoing Director Adm. Roscoe Hillenkoetter


Prior to discharge from the Army and OSS, Jackson was assigned the task of studying the British Secret Intelligence Service. The study took four months working in London with MI-5, MI-6 and Sir Anthony Eden to complete a report for Gen. Marshall and Gen. Donovan on June 14, 1945. Subsequently, on November 14, 1945 at the request of then SecNav James Forrestal, William Harding Jackson submitted his own plan for a new central intelligence agency as an alternative to General Donovan's plan.[8]
After World War II, Jackson resigned from Carter, Ledyard & Milburn to become an investment banker and the 'Managing Partner' (1947-1955) for J.H. Whitney & Co. of New York.[9]
In 1948, George F. Kennan proposed that control over the government's directorate for political warfare should be "answerable" to the Secretary of State, suggesting that "one man must be boss;" and suggesting further, that the Director of Central Intelligence and the Agency should get "...out of the business of covert psychological operations..." Kennan took the discussion to Allen W. Dulles, then in private law practice in New York, thinking Dulles would be the logical choice to head the new agency at State. Some believe this started an inter-agency squabble over just "whom" would control intelligence among the military-industrial and civilian intelligence complex. National Security Council executive director, Adm. Sidney Souers, appointed Jackson on February 13 to serve on the NSC's "Intelligence Survey Group" with Allen Dulles and Mathias Correa (an aide to then Sec. of Defense James Forrestal) for the purpose of analyzing departmental practices and inter-agency coordination. The Survey Group, known as the Dulles, Jackson, Correa Committee or Dulles Group, submitted its final report on February 28, 1949. It was a scathing criticism of CIA and its operations under Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, which resulted in the removal of several key persons at CIA and, eventually, the removal of Hillenkoetter.[2]
On July 18, 1950 the new Sec. of Defense, Louis Johnson and Gen. Omar Bradley sent a letter to President Truman nominating William Harding Jackson for Director of Central Intelligence to replace Hillenkoetter. Having known of Jackson's background, Truman penned a short note at the bottom of the letter and sent it to his White House aide, Donald S. Dawson, saying "...Don: Let's look into this. Tell Mr. [Averell] Harriman what we are doing. If this works out, we'll forget Gen. Smith."[10]
General Walter Bedell Smith did not want the job of DCI and tried to beg off on health issues, repeatedly. When Jackson declined because of philanthropic and business commitments in New York, Truman is said to have all but issued a direct order as commander-in-chief to General Smith, that he would become the next DCI. Smith then turned to Bill Jackson as his nominee for Deputy Director of Central Intelligence to reorganize the Agency - with particular emphasis on covert activities, psychological warfare, and building a professional career Agency.
Jackson was appointed Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency on August 18, 1950, and sworn-in October 7. He was the first Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI) to serve under former Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1945–46) and former World War II four-star General, Walter Bedell Smith (DCI). Smith and Jackson brought Allen W. Dulles to CIA under contract as Deputy Director/Plans (clandestine activities) in early 1951. After completing the reorganization in accordance with adoption of the Dulles Report and NSC-50, and Jackson's resignation in August 1951, Allen Dulles was promoted to DDCI to replace Jackson, later, replacing Smith as DCI in 1953. Jackson remained a contract special adviser to the DCI through both the Smith and Dulles directorships. During the Eisenhower Administration, Bill Jackson is listed by the 'White House Staff' publication[11] and by the CIA as being a 'Special Adviser' and 'Senior Consultant to the Director of Central Intelligence' (from 1951–1955).
In 1953, Jackson was appointed Chairman of President Eisenhower's Committee on International Information Activities, often known inside the Beltway as the Jackson Committee (1953-1954) which led to creation of the US Information Agency (USIA). In December 1955 Jackson resigned from J. H. Whitney & Co. and was named 'Special Assistant to the Secretary of State' John Foster Dulles to attend the 1955 Big Four talks in Geneva.[12] In February 1956 Jackson was appointed special assistant to President Eisenhower on psychological warfare, succeeding Nelson Rockefeller.[13] Jackson served briefly as United States National Security Adviser from September 1, 1956 until January 7, 1957.
Personal life[edit]
Jackson's first wife, Elizabeth Lyman (married 1929) was the ex-wife of Thomas Rice of Dover; she brought two children Thomas Rice, Jr. and Lyman Rice to their marriage. Jackson and Elizabeth had two more sons, William Harding Jackson, Jr. and Richard Lee Jackson. They divorced in 1946 after Jackson returned from World War II.
At age 39, Jackson was elected the youngest president to serve (1940-1949) on the board of directors of The Society of the New York Hospital, one of America's oldest hospitals founded by King George III in 1771, and was nominated to the National Academy of Sciences.[14] After the war, Jackson was elected to the boards of Bankers Trust, the John Hay Whitney Foundation, the New York Hospital for Special Surgery, and the Menninger Foundation.
In 1951, Jackson married Mary Pitcairn, the daughter of Norman B. Pitcairn, a former president of the Wabash Railroad.[15] They had two sons together: Bruce P. Jackson and Howell E. Jackson. After they divorced, around 1965, Keating married another New York lawyer, Wendell Davis, who died in 1972. She married a third time to U.S. Senator and former Ambassador to Israel, Kenneth Keating; thus, becoming Mary Pitcairn Jackson Davis Keating.[8]
Death[edit]
Jackson died on September 28, 1971 in Tucson, Arizona at age 71.[1] He is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

Ingersoll) of the USAAF Bay of Biscay Intelligence Estimate, calling for the attack on Nazi U-boats at their source on the coast of France. This was a significant turning point for the Battle of the Atlantic. After graduation from Harrisburg in June 1942 Jackson was promoted to Major and brought into the War Department by Sec. Henry L. Stimson where he became General Staff - Chief of Secret Intelligence reporting to Gen. George C. Marshall from the European Theater of Operations (ETO) at COSSAC headquarters - with the 'cover' title Chief of G-2 intelligence for 1st Army Group (FUSAG). After training on the Enigma codes at Bletchley Park UK he became the senior ULTRA SCIU team leader for all US armies in the ETO.[5]
Jackson achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel, and was assigned by Gen. Hap Arnold to the planning staff of Brig. Gen. Harold George who had just taken over the USAAF Air Transport Command. He was listed as the Adjutant General for the ATC European Wing that ferried more than 7,000 US aircraft to Britain during WW-II. He received recognition for work rebuilding or expanding air fields in the UK for American aircraft and creating an expanded communications network for top secret secured communications (again, with Standish and Ingersoll). By summer of 1943, he was given the 'cover title' Assistant Attache for Air, stationed at the US Embassy under Ambassador Gil Winant near Grosvenor Square, next to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Shortly, thereafter he was promoted to full colonel and appointed G-2 intelligence chief at 1st Army Group (FUSAG) headquarters in London's West End to work on Operation Bodyguard, the massive deception plan to make the Nazis believe the D-Day assault (Operation Overlord) would come from Scandinavia in the north and at Pas-de-Calais under the command of Gen. George S. Patton, at the narrowest point of the English Channel. He worked closely with Gen. T. J. Betts, Deputy G-2 SHAEF and then Colonel Edwin L. Sibert ('G-2') at Headquarters, 1st Army located in Bristol.
After the successful D-Day feint, Jackson was made head of all OSS X-2 Special Counter-Intelligence Units (SCIU) in the ETO, traveling with 12th Army Group's forward EAGLE TAC headquarters to Luxembourg on General Omar Bradley's staff.[6] During the "Battle of the Bulge" in Dec-Jan 1945 (in addition to his duties with ULTRA and SCIU teams) on January 1, 1945 during the middle of heated battle, Jackson was named Deputy G-2 for all US armies at 12th Army Group.[7]
Decorations—For service to his country and the people of Europe, Jackson was awarded the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit with 1-OLC, the Belgian Crois de Guerre and is believed to be the only US Army officer below the rank of general to receive both the French Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre with Palm.




CIA Change of Command - 7 October 1950 - (Front Row L to R) Incoming Deputy Director William Harding Jackson, incoming Director Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, outgoing Director Adm. Roscoe Hillenkoetter


Prior to discharge from the Army and OSS, Jackson was assigned the task of studying the British Secret Intelligence Service. The study took four months working in London with MI-5, MI-6 and Sir Anthony Eden to complete a report for Gen. Marshall and Gen. Donovan on June 14, 1945. Subsequently, on November 14, 1945 at the request of then SecNav James Forrestal, William Harding Jackson submitted his own plan for a new central intelligence agency as an alternative to General Donovan's plan.[8]
After World War II, Jackson resigned from Carter, Ledyard & Milburn to become an investment banker and the 'Managing Partner' (1947-1955) for J.H. Whitney & Co. of New York.[9]
In 1948, George F. Kennan proposed that control over the government's directorate for political warfare should be "answerable" to the Secretary of State, suggesting that "one man must be boss;" and suggesting further, that the Director of Central Intelligence and the Agency should get "...out of the business of covert psychological operations..." Kennan took the discussion to Allen W. Dulles, then in private law practice in New York, thinking Dulles would be the logical choice to head the new agency at State. Some believe this started an inter-agency squabble over just "whom" would control intelligence among the military-industrial and civilian intelligence complex. National Security Council executive director, Adm. Sidney Souers, appointed Jackson on February 13 to serve on the NSC's "Intelligence Survey Group" with Allen Dulles and Mathias Correa (an aide to then Sec. of Defense James Forrestal) for the purpose of analyzing departmental practices and inter-agency coordination. The Survey Group, known as the Dulles, Jackson, Correa Committee or Dulles Group, submitted its final report on February 28, 1949. It was a scathing criticism of CIA and its operations under Director Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, which resulted in the removal of several key persons at CIA and, eventually, the removal of Hillenkoetter.[2]
On July 18, 1950 the new Sec. of Defense, Louis Johnson and Gen. Omar Bradley sent a letter to President Truman nominating William Harding Jackson for Director of Central Intelligence to replace Hillenkoetter. Having known of Jackson's background, Truman penned a short note at the bottom of the letter and sent it to his White House aide, Donald S. Dawson, saying "...Don: Let's look into this. Tell Mr. [Averell] Harriman what we are doing. If this works out, we'll forget Gen. Smith."[10]
General Walter Bedell Smith did not want the job of DCI and tried to beg off on health issues, repeatedly. When Jackson declined because of philanthropic and business commitments in New York, Truman is said to have all but issued a direct order as commander-in-chief to General Smith, that he would become the next DCI. Smith then turned to Bill Jackson as his nominee for Deputy Director of Central Intelligence to reorganize the Agency - with particular emphasis on covert activities, psychological warfare, and building a professional career Agency.
Jackson was appointed Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency on August 18, 1950, and sworn-in October 7. He was the first Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI) to serve under former Ambassador to the Soviet Union (1945–46) and former World War II four-star General, Walter Bedell Smith (DCI). Smith and Jackson brought Allen W. Dulles to CIA under contract as Deputy Director/Plans (clandestine activities) in early 1951. After completing the reorganization in accordance with adoption of the Dulles Report and NSC-50, and Jackson's resignation in August 1951, Allen Dulles was promoted to DDCI to replace Jackson, later, replacing Smith as DCI in 1953. Jackson remained a contract special adviser to the DCI through both the Smith and Dulles directorships. During the Eisenhower Administration, Bill Jackson is listed by the 'White House Staff' publication[11] and by the CIA as being a 'Special Adviser' and 'Senior Consultant to the Director of Central Intelligence' (from 1951–1955).
In 1953, Jackson was appointed Chairman of President Eisenhower's Committee on International Information Activities, often known inside the Beltway as the Jackson Committee (1953-1954) which led to creation of the US Information Agency (USIA). In December 1955 Jackson resigned from J. H. Whitney & Co. and was named 'Special Assistant to the Secretary of State' John Foster Dulles to attend the 1955 Big Four talks in Geneva.[12] In February 1956 Jackson was appointed special assistant to President Eisenhower on psychological warfare, succeeding Nelson Rockefeller.[13] Jackson served briefly as United States National Security Adviser from September 1, 1956 until January 7, 1957.
Personal life[edit]
Jackson's first wife, Elizabeth Lyman (married 1929) was the ex-wife of Thomas Rice of Dover; she brought two children Thomas Rice, Jr. and Lyman Rice to their marriage. Jackson and Elizabeth had two more sons, William Harding Jackson, Jr. and Richard Lee Jackson. They divorced in 1946 after Jackson returned from World War II.
At age 39, Jackson was elected the youngest president to serve (1940-1949) on the board of directors of The Society of the New York Hospital, one of America's oldest hospitals founded by King George III in 1771, and was nominated to the National Academy of Sciences.[14] After the war, Jackson was elected to the boards of Bankers Trust, the John Hay Whitney Foundation, the New York Hospital for Special Surgery, and the Menninger Foundation.
In 1951, Jackson married Mary Pitcairn, the daughter of Norman B. Pitcairn, a former president of the Wabash Railroad.[15] They had two sons together: Bruce P. Jackson and Howell E. Jackson. After they divorced, around 1965, Keating married another New York lawyer, Wendell Davis, who died in 1972. She married a third time to U.S. Senator and former Ambassador to Israel, Kenneth Keating; thus, becoming Mary Pitcairn Jackson Davis Keating.[8]
Death[edit]
Jackson died on September 28, 1971 in Tucson, Arizona at age 71.[1] He is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

All told, you have plenty of options if you're looking for a storage facility.What Services are Provided?When you want to store extra materials, you can typically find a self-storage facility and lease space on a month-to-month basis. Such areas are just the right size to store household items, office supplies and even furniture. Storage facilities are ideal if you have a lot of personal items you want to keep but don't have enough space in your house or apartment.Items you store are not insured by the facility. Instead, you will need to talk with an insurance representative about covering your items if they are stored off-premise. A few facilities offer insurance, so you'll want to call and ask around to find which option best meets your needs.Advantages of Self Storage
When you're looking for storage options, do not confuse self storage with full service. You will have limited access to your belongings if you choose the full-service option. Self storage gives you full control over what's in your unit and how you arrange everything, said SpareFoot Blog.Another advantage of storing your personal items is the flexibility afforded to you. You don't have to wait for anyone to come to your unit and unlock it, nor do you have to receive permission to add items or take them away.With self-storage facilities, you can put as many items in the unit as you want, provided everything fits and you keep the space organized. If you feel like taking an early morning or evening trip to your storage space, you can do so at your pleasure.Reasons to Use Self Storage
Whether you're a single individual or have a growing family, self storage is a viable option to store your personal items in a safe, secure location without sacrificing space in your home. Specific reasons why you might also need to lease storage space include:A need to store items while you move DownsizingStoring supplies for your small businessEven college students can take advantage of self storage, especially if they attend school out of state. Instead of lugging apartment furniture and winter clothes back and forth, they can store everything for the few months they're home and then retrieve them when school starts back up.How to Find the Right FacilityWhen searching for a self-storage facility, you'll first want to look for options close to where you live. The size of the space you plan to rent is also an important factor to consider, and will depend on what you plan to store.Spaces range from the size of a small closet to a car garage, said Extra Space Storage. The following are common storage sizes, along with examples of what they can hold:5 feet by 5 feet: Ideal for small boxes, a mattress, dresser and other small items.5 feet by 10 feet: The items commonly found in a mid-sized bedroom, including a queen mattress, boxes, dresser and a TV, can fit in this space.5 feet by 15 feet: The equivalent of a walk-in closet.10 feet by 10 feet: Equal to half of a garage, this space can store the items from a family room or two single bedrooms.10 feet by 15 feet: A little smaller than a one-car garage, you can fit a piano and other large items, in addition to boxes, in this space.10 feet by 20 feet: You can store the items from a multi-bedroom house here, including large appliances.10 feet by 25 feet: Larger than a one-car garage, three bedrooms worth of items can fit in this space.10 feet by 30 feet: Everything in a three-to-five bedroom house can fit in this storage space.Creating a checklist before leasing storage space will help you make an informed decision about the unit size you need to rent. You don't want to pay for more than you need, while you also don't want too small of a space. You should also consider your future needs, because it is not out of the question you may decide to store more personal items.Location Affects Price
The size of the storage space will have an effect on the amount you pay. Additionally, where the storage unit is located also has an influence. Expect to pay more in monthly fees if the storage space is in a city where real estate is more expensive. High costs might be unavoidable, but if you look around at various options, you'll eventually find the best price.Comparing Facilities
If you've found self-storage facilities that are nearby, you'll then want to compare prices from at least three options. After doing so, look up the facilities through the Better Business Bureau. Some areas to keep an eye out for include any complaints against the storage facility and whether insurance policies are offered.Types of Storage FacilitiesFor the average homeowner, self-storage facilities are the most popular option for storing personal items, but other types of storage facilities exist. Most people don't think about the type of storage available until they absolutely need it, and it's best to understand your options ahead of time.Likewise, various names exist for self-storage facilities. In all, expect to come across five general types of storage facilities.Indoor Storage
Typically found in large buildings that used to be factories, indoor units require you to go through security to enter. You can expect to find unit sizes ranging from 5 feet by 5 feet to 5 feet by 10 feet.Outdoor Storage
Outdoor units are not located in a warehouse but in an area where security is still required. Outdoor storage units are typically large, and should only be used for boats, cars, recreational vehicles and tractors. Since units are outside, they are subject to weather conditions, meaning it's not the best idea to store your valuables in them.Climate Controlled
Climate-controlled storage units are located indoors and have temperature and humidity controls. If you have items that may become damaged by atmospheric conditions, controlling the temperature and humidity is essential.You will end up paying more for a climate-controlled storage space. However, in the grand scheme of things, a slightly higher cost doesn't compare to the costs associated with losing or replacing valuable or rare items.Consider climate-controlled self storage if you are housing some of the following items:Televisions and other electronicsPaintingsClothingWineMusical InstrumentsAntiquesFurnitureDocumentsPhotographsDrive-up Units
Outside of city areas, drive-up storage units are some of the most common options. Drive-up units are arranged in long lines and resemble garages, led to by roads so you can easily drive to your specific unit.Mobile Storage
Realistically, mobile storage is only an option if you're moving or renovating your house. Mobile storage units are not part of an existing facility. Mobile units are typically stationed outside your home after they are delivered by the storage company.Once you fill up the unit, the company will either hold it at their facility or transport it to your desired destination.Mobile storage is a viable self-storage option if you plan to move across the country but are worried about space in a moving truck.Cost ConsiderationsThe price of using a self-storage facility will vary, with one of biggest factors being where you live. You may find it beneficial to rent storage in a nearby suburb if facilities are too expensive in your city. Also, some facilities offer introductory rates for the first month, and similar deals are worth exploring.Keep in mind, however, costs will increase depending on the size of unit you're renting and whether or not it's climate controlled.Seeking Lower Costs
To get the most bang for your buck and avoid breaking the bank, shop around for the best prices and only rent storage space you know you will need. The larger the item, the more space required.Likewise, only opt for climate-controlled space if the personal items you are storing are susceptible to becoming damaged from humidity and temperature. There is no reason to get an air-conditioned unit if you're locking away old baseball equipment and tools.Storage TipsWhen it comes to taking full advantage of your self-storage facility, you have to know what you can and cannot store. Some items are not suitable for storage.Flammables like gasoline, propane tanks and kerosene, as well as certain types of paint are not allowed to be stored by any means, said Extra Space Storage. Other items, such as perishable food, are not allowed either because of the tendency to attract pests and rodents when the food starts to expire.Knowing what you can store will help you better organize your storage space and clear out any clutter.Packing Tips
An art form exists when it comes to packing - you don't want to throw whatever you get your hands on in a box. To be more efficient, fill the boxes with similar items. For example, don't mix glassware with utensils. Always try to fill the box to capacity, and remember, anything left unpacked will become dusty. If you're storing fragile items, consider packing them in a separate box filled with foam peanuts for extra protection.From there, you can create a label system to help locate specific boxes within the unit. Markers tend to wear out after time. Label makers are a smart, inexpensive option to help you identify a box's contents.Some items require specific packing quirks. For instance, you should ensure books are packed flat to avoid damaging their spines. You also don't want to put too many books in a single box because it then becomes too heavy to carry.Glassware and valuable china should all be individually wrapped and placed in reinforced or separate boxes. You can then use the label maker to ensure the word "fragile" is somewhere on the box.Storing Furniture
Different pieces of furniture require certain methods of storage. Special bags will protect any couches and chairs you're storing. When you bring these items to the unit, be sure to stand them up to maximize space.Bed frames should ideally be taken apart before being put into a storage unit, while mattresses can be wrapped in a protective seal and stood against a wall. If you're unable to take apart the bed frame, do not store any materials nearby that may taint the color of the bedding.For smaller tables, try to take them apart. If that's not possible, place a moving blanket on the floor and then place the table on top with its legs facing upward, and then wrap them in a protective material. For chairs, place them upside down on a table also covered in protective material.Dressers can be placed against the wall and also used as a space to store boxes. Additionally, the drawers can house small fragile items. Just be sure to use stretch wrap to prevent the drawers from opening.Lamps should be disassembled, wrapped in protective material and placed in boxes specifically designed to store lamps. When it comes to televisions, protect them as much as possible. If you're storing a TV, you'll likely want to rent a climate-controlled storage unit because extreme temperatures may cause some issues with liquid crystal displays.In general, furniture should be stored with care and covered in protective material whenever possible. Ensure your storage space can hold multiple large furniture sets as well.SecurityMost storage facilities have security measures in place. They are generally accessible for a certain number of hours and have a manager on site, in addition to security cameras. They also require you to submit a special code to enter. You should also make sure the property is adequately lit for visits in the evening.You will need to have your own lock for your storage unit. Keyless locks, padlocks and disc locks are all viable options, said Moove In Self Storage.Self-storage units come in many sizes, types and costs. If you're looking to clear out space from your house, consider renting a storage unit to keep your personal items safe. You can store just about anything, from furniture to old vinyl collections and clothes. By choosing the right storage unit, you can store your items in a secure location while gaining back some much needed space in your house.
