CST Brands, Inc. Names Joseph E. Reece To Board






November 24, 2015 04:05 PM Eastern Standard Time



SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CST Brands, Inc. (NYSE: CST), a San Antonio-based Fortune 500 fuel and 
      convenience retailer, today announced that the Board of Directors has 
      appointed Joseph E. Reece as an independent director of the Company. Mr. 
      Reece will also serve on the Company’s Executive and Nominating and 
      Governance Committees.
    


      The CST Nominating and Governance Committee periodically assesses the 
      Board’s composition so that the Board encompasses a broad range of 
      skills, expertise, industry knowledge, diversity of opinion and contacts 
      relevant to the Company’s business. Following Mr. Reece’s appointment, 9 
      of CST’s 11 directors are independent.
    

      “We conducted a search for someone who would further strengthen our 
      Board’s breadth of talent and background, and we are delighted to have 
      identified such an outstanding individual. Joe brings extensive 
      investment banking and capital markets experience to the CST Board; 
      furthermore, his depth and breadth of knowledge of the industry sectors 
      in which CST participates (retail, energy and real estate) is immense," 
      said Michael Wargotz, Chair of CST's Nominating and Governance 
      Committee. "Joe's nearly three decades as an investment banker and 
      lawyer, coupled with his deep financial markets experience, make him a 
      perfect fit for CST's Board."
    

      "We couldn't be more pleased to have Joe join our Board. He will be an 
      invaluable resource, along with the rest of our Board members, in 
      evaluating and providing oversight of our strategic initiatives and 
      capital deployment in our ongoing efforts in creating long-term value 
      for our shareholders," said Kim Lubel, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer 
      and President of CST.
    

      “CST is poised for rapid and transformative growth in the energy and 
      convenience sector. I believe my experience will provide CST’s Board an 
      additional resource as CST’s dynamic leadership team continues to refine 
      and execute its strategy. CST is a leader in its field and I am honored 
      to be joining its Board,” said Mr. Reece.
    

      Joe has more than 28 years of experience advising public and private 
      corporations, boards, financial sponsors and institutional investors on 
      strategy, financing, and mergers and acquisitions. Joe has extensive 
      experience in the real estate, consumer and retail, energy, technology, 
      media, healthcare, financial services and industrial sectors. During his 
      tenure at Credit Suisse, Joe worked with a diverse group of clients 
      including: Alibaba, Oracle, The Container Store, Smart & Final, White 
      Wave, Bolthouse Farms, Dean Foods, Lucky Brand, Aramark, Hilton, 
      Marriott, Diamond Resorts, SunPower, Edison International, Edison 
      Mission Energy, Unisource, Valero Energy, General Motors, 
      Ford, Freeport, Blackstone, Oaktree, Ares, Sempra, Markit, 
      Glencore, and Rio Tinto.
    

      Joe recently concluded his 18-year career with Credit Suisse as its 
      Global Head of Equity Capital Markets (ECM). During his career at Credit 
      Suisse, Joe provided investment banking, capital market advisory 
      services, and merger and acquisition advice across a broad range of 
      industries. As the Global Head of ECM, Joe participated in 
      the origination and distribution of equity products globally on behalf 
      of Credit Suisse clients, as well as developing and overseeing 
      management protocols for the related risk book. During his career, 
      Joe led multiple business units both regionally and globally, 
      participated in business turnarounds as well as new business 
      development; and ultimately sat on both the Global Equities Management 
      Committee and the Investment Banking Management Committee.
    

      Prior to becoming an Investment Banker, Joe spent ten years as a 
      practicing attorney. Joe began his career at the United States 
      Securities and Exchange Commission as Staff Counsel ultimately rising to 
      become Special Counsel for the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance.

      Corporate Practice Group. While at Skadden Arps, Joe represented a broad 
      group of Corporate, Financial Sponsor, and Institutional Clients in a 
      wide range of strategic, corporate and securities matters.
    

      Joe is currently the President and Founder of Helena Capital, a Merchant 
      Bank with offices in New York and Los Angeles, where, in addition to 
      principal investing, he continues to provide CEO level counseling 
      focused on long-term value creation.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
