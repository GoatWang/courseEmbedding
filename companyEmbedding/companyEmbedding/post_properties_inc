COMPANY NEWS

                    POST PROPERTIES RECEIVED TAKEOVER BID LAST MONTH                
Post Properties Inc., a developer, received a $26-a-share takeover offer last month, but the board declined to pursue talks with the potential acquirer, the company's former chairman said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Post, a real estate investment trust based in Atlanta, received an offer from a ''reputable real estate investment firm'' on March 14, the former chairman, John A. Williams, said. He did not identify the firm. Mr. Williams was ousted as chairman in February but remains on the board. One reason the company did not pursue the bid was that it was only a slight premium to the stock price, a spokeswoman said.










COMPANY NEWS

                    ATLANTA COMPANY TO DEVELOP APARTMENTS IN NEW YORK                
Post Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust, is planning to develop three apartment buildings in New York City, including one high- rise just north of Times Square, company officials said. The company, based in Atlanta, and its partners are working on a 330-unit luxury tower at 51st Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, a 140-unit project at 23rd Street and First Avenue, and a 185-unit tower at 89th Street and First Avenue, David Stockert, the president of Post, said during a conference call yesterday with analysts and investors. Analysts at Merrill Lynch estimated development costs at about $225 million. Post plans to start looking for financing soon and begin construction later this year, Mr. Stockert said.










COMPANY NEWS

                    POST PROPERTIES-COLUMBUS IN $600 MILLION DEAL                
Post Properties Inc. has agreed to acquire the Dallas-based residential property developer Columbus Realty Trust for about $600 million, including debt, the companies said yesterday. Post Properties, also a real estate investment trust, said each Columbus share would be exchanged for 0.615 Post Properties share. The deal, which is expected to be completed in November, would combine the 7,526 Columbus apartment homes, mainly in Dallas, with Post Properties' 21,673 apartment homes. After completion of the deal, the Atlanta-based Post Properties would have total market capitalization of about $2.2 billion. Columbus would operate under the Post Properties name.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
