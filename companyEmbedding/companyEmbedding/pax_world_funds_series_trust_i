	The section entitled

	Principal Investment Strategies

	is replaced in its entirety with the following:


	 


	Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests primarily in large-capitalization domestic equity securities that the Adviser believes have strong Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) profiles and that exhibit higher “quality” characteristics and reasonable valuations. Specifically, the strategy favors securities with stronger ESG scores (as determined by the Adviser), higher profitability, higher earnings quality (based on a quantitative assessment of operating fundamentals and accruals), lower risk (i.e., the historic volatility of a security relative to the overall market) and lower valuations relative to the Russell 1000 Index.


	 


	The Adviser utilizes a quantitative process, optimizing ESG, quality factors and valuation factors relative to benchmark constraints.


	 


	ESG scores are calculated based on the Adviser’s assessment of an issuer’s ESG profile. The scores emphasize management of ESG-related risks, incorporate ESG trends (taking into account progress or regression in a company’s ESG profile) and adjust for involvement in significant ESG-related controversies.


	 


	Quality factors include but are not limited to quantitative determinations of profitability, earnings quality and risk. Valuation scores reflect a combination of earnings-based valuation measures.


	 


	The Fund may invest a portion of its assets in securities of non-U.S. issuers, including emerging market investments and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”), but may invest no more than 25% of its assets in securities of non-U.S. issuers other than ADRs.


	 


	The Fund may utilize derivatives for hedging and for investment purposes.


	 



	Page 9



	 


	Under the section entitled


	Principal Risks


	, the risk description subtitled

	Small- and Medium Sized Capitalization Company Risk

	is deleted in its entirety. The following risk descriptions are added:


	 



	Equity Securities Risk

	The market price of equity securities may fluctuate significantly, rapidly and unpredictably, causing the Fund to experience losses. The prices of equity securities generally are more volatile than the prices of debt securities.


	 



	Value Securities Risk

	The Fund may invest in companies that may not be expected to experience significant earnings growth, but whose securities the investment adviser believes are selling at a price lower than their true value. Companies that issue value securities may have experienced adverse business developments or may be subject to special risks that have caused their securities to be out of favor. If the investment adviser’s assessment of a company’s prospects is wrong, or if the market does not recognize the value of the company, the price of its securities may decline or may not approach the value that the investment adviser anticipates.


	 



	Quantitative Models Risk

	Aperio uses quantitative analyses and models as part of its investment process, and any imperfections, errors, or limitations in those analyses and models could affect the Fund’s performance. By necessity, these analyses and models make simplifying assumptions that limit their efficacy. Models that appear


	 








	to explain prior market data can fail to predict future market events. Further, the data used in models may be inaccurate or subjective and may not include the most recent information about a company or a security. The Fund also runs the risk that PWM’s or Aperio’s assessment of an investment or its attributes may be wrong or that deficiencies in their internal systems or controls will cause losses for the Fund or impair Fund operations.

	Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests primarily in large-capitalization domestic equity securities that the Adviser believes have strong Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) profiles and that exhibit higher quality characteristics and reasonable valuations. Specifically, the strategy favors securities with stronger ESG scores (as determined by the Adviser), higher profitability, higher earnings quality (based on a quantitative assessment of operating fundamentals and accruals), lower risk (i.e., the historic volatility of a security relative to the overall market) and lower valuations relative to the Russell 1000 Index.


	 


	The Adviser utilizes a quantitative process, optimizing ESG, quality and valuation factors relative to carefully selected benchmark constraints.


	 


	ESG scores are calculated based on the Adviser’s assessment of an issuer’s ESG profile. The scores emphasize management of ESG-related risks, incorporate ESG trends (taking into account progress or regression in a company’s ESG profile) and adjust for involvement in significant ESG-related controversies.


	 


	Quality factors include but are not limited to quantitative determinations of profitability, earnings quality and risk. Valuation is determined by considering a combination of earnings-based valuation measures.


	 








	The Fund may invest a portion of its assets in securities of non-U.S. issuers, including emerging market investments and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”), but may invest no more than 25% of its assets in securities of non-U.S. issuers other than ADRs.


	 


	The Fund may utilize derivatives for hedging and for investment purposes.


	 


	Except as otherwise noted in this Prospectus or the Statement of Additional


	 


	Information, the ESG Beta Quality Fund’s investment policies are not fundamental and may be changed without a vote of shareholders.


	 



	Page 108



	 


	The following paragraph is added after the paragraph that begins on page 107 with the words: “The Pax MSCI International ESG Index Fund invests….”:


	 


	With respect to the ESG Beta Quality Fund the Adviser determines an ESG score for each company, based on the Adviser’s assessment of key ESG issues by industry, and calculating ESG scores based on companies’ performance on these key issues. The scores emphasize management of ESG-related risks, incorporate ESG trends (taking into account progress or regression in a company’s ESG profile) and adjust for involvement in significant ESG-related controversies.


	 



	Page 113



	 


	The Annual Management Fee Rate for the Fund, set forth in the table in the middle of the page, is replaced with 0.65%.


	 


	The reference to the Growth Fund is removed from the first sentence of the section entitled

	Sub-Advisers

	.


	 



	Page 114



	 


	The following two paragraphs replace the first full paragraph:


	 


	For the ESG Beta Quality Fund and the Global Environmental Markets Fund, PWM has engaged investment management firms (the “Sub-Advisers”) to manage each respective Fund’s investments. The Sub-Advisers have full investment discretion and make all determinations with respect to the investment of the Fund which they sub-advise, subject to the general supervision of PWM and the Board of Trustees. PWM (and not the ESG Beta Quality Fund or the Global Environmental Markets Fund) pays a portion of the advisory fees it receives to the Sub-Advisers in return for their services. The following provides summary information about each Sub-Adviser:


	 


	Aperio Group, LLC (“Aperio”) is the Sub-Adviser of the ESG Beta Quality Fund. Aperio has its principal offices at 3 Harbor Drive, Sausalito, CA. Aperio, as of December 31, 2015, had approximately $11.7 billion of funds under management. Aperio focuses on managing customized index portfolios with an emphasis on after-tax return and meeting specific client-driven objectives such as ESG and other criteria.

	The following is added to the section entitled

	Investment Advisory and Other Services

	:


	 



	Aperio Group, LLC (“Aperio”)

	is the Sub-Adviser of the ESG Beta Quality Fund. Aperio has its principal offices at 3 Harbor Drive, Sausalito, CA. Aperio, as of December 31, 2015, had approximately $11.7 billion of funds under management. Aperio focuses on managing customized index portfolios with an emphasis on after-tax return and meeting specific client driven objectives such as ESG and other criteria.


	 



	Pages 66-67



	 


	The table at the top of page 66 (which begins on page 65) in the section

	Advisory Agreements

	is amended with respect to the ESG Quality Beta Fund to provide that fees are payable at the annual rate (expressed as a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets) of 0.65%.


	 


	The three paragraphs beginning with the penultimate paragraph on page 66, in the section entitled

	Advisory Agreements

	(which begins on Page 65) are replaced with the following:


	 


	Pursuant to sub-advisory agreements (the “Sub-Advisory Agreements”), IAM assists in the management of the Global Environmental Markets Fund’s portfolio of securities and Aperio assists in the management of the ESG Beta Quality Fund’s portfolio of securities. The sub-advisers make decisions with respect to the purchase and sale of investments, subject to the general control of the Board of the Fund and the determination of PWM that the contemplated investments satisfy the sustainable investing criteria applied to the Funds.


	 


	The Sub-Advisory Agreements are terminable without penalty by the Fund on sixty days written notice when authorized either by majority vote of the Fund’s outstanding voting shares or by a vote of a majority of its Disinterested Trustees, or by the sub-advisers on sixty days written notice, and will automatically terminate in the event of their assignment. The Sub-Advisory Agreements provide that in the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of either of the sub-advisers, or of reckless disregard of its obligations thereunder, the sub-adviser shall not be liable for any action or failure to act in accordance with its duties thereunder.


	 


	For its services under the Sub-Advisory Agreement, Impax receives from PWM a fee equal to 0.40% per annum of the Global Environmental Fund’s average daily net assets and Aperio receives from PWM a fee equal to 0.08% per annum of the ESG Beta Quality Fund’s average daily net assets. The fees are accrued daily and paid monthly. The sub-advisers, at their discretion, may voluntarily waive all or a portion of the sub-advisory fee. Investment advisory fees and operating expenses which are attributable to each Class of the Fund will be allocated daily to each Class based on the relative values of net assets at the end of the day. Additional expenses for shareholder services and distribution services provided by participating organizations to Fund shareholders may be compensated by ALPS Distributors, Inc. from its own resources which includes the shareholder servicing fees and past profits, or by PWM and/or the sub-advisers from their own resources which includes the Advisory or sub-advisory fee and administrative services fee. Expenses incurred in the distribution and the servicing of Institutional Class shares shall be paid by PWM. (See “Distribution and Service Plans” herein.)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. Mutual Funds Trust, a Massachusetts business trust, is registered under the Act as open-end management investment companies and currently offers eleven series (each a “Series” and Mutual Funds Trust, Series or future Series, a “Fund” and collectively the “Funds”), each of which has its own distinct investment objectives, policies and restrictions.[1] 
           The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and serves as the investment adviser to the Mutual Funds Trust pursuant to separate investment advisory agreements (each an “Investment Advisory Agreement” and collectively, the “Investment Advisory Agreements”) with each Fund. Each Investment Advisory Agreement has been or will be approved by the Mutual Funds Trust's board of trustees (the “Board”), including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, of the Trust or the Adviser (“Independent Trustees”) and by the shareholders of the relevant Fund in the manner required by sections 15(a) and 15(c) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act.
2. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreements, the Adviser, subject to the oversight of the Board, furnishes a continuous investment program for each Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews investment policies and strategies of each Fund and based on the need of a particular Fund may recommend changes to the investment policies and strategies of the Fund for consideration by its Board. For its services to each Fund, the Adviser receives an investment advisory fee from that Fund as specified in the applicable Investment Advisory Agreement based on the average daily net asset value of that Fund. The terms of the Investment Advisory Agreements also permit the Adviser, subject to the approval of the relevant Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, and the shareholders of the applicable Subadvised Funds (if required by applicable law), to delegate portfolio management responsibilities of all or a portion of the assets of the Subadvised Fund to one or more subadvisers (“Sub-Advisers”). The Adviser has entered into subadvisory agreements (“Sub-Advisory Agreements”) with various Sub-Advisers to provide investment advisory services to various Subadvised Funds.[2] 
           Each Sub-Adviser is, and each future Sub-Adviser will be, an investment adviser as defined in section 2(a)(20) of the Act as well as registered with the Commission as an “investment adviser” under the Advisers Act. The Adviser evaluates, allocates assets to and oversees the Sub-Advisers, and makes recommendations about their hiring, termination and replacement to the Board, at all times subject to the authority of the Board.[3] 
           The Adviser will compensate each Sub-Adviser out of the fee paid to the Adviser under the relevant Investment Advisory Agreement, or the Subadvised Fund will be responsible for paying subadvisory fees directly to the Sub-Adviser.
3. Applicants request an order to permit the Adviser, subject to Board approval, to select certain Sub-Advisers to manage all or a portion of the assets of a Subadvised Fund pursuant to a Sub-Advisory Agreement and materially amend Sub-Advisory Agreements without obtaining shareholder approval. The requested relief will not extend to any Sub-Adviser that is an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of a Subadvised Fund or the Adviser, other than by reason of serving as a Sub-Adviser a Subadvised Funds (“Affiliated Sub-Adviser”).
4. Applicants also request an order exempting the Subadvised Funds from certain disclosure provisions described below that may require the Applicants to disclose fees paid by the Adviser or a Subadvised Fund to each Sub-Adviser. Applicants seek an order to permit each Subadvised Fund to disclose (as a dollar amount and a percentage of each Start Printed Page 50775Subadvised Fund's net assets) only: (a) The aggregate fees paid to the Adviser and any Affiliated Sub-Advisers; and (b) the aggregate fees paid to Sub-Advisers other than Affiliated Sub-Advisers (collectively, the “Aggregate Fee Disclosure”). A Subadvised Fund that employs an Affiliated Sub-Adviser will provide separate disclosure of any fees paid to the Affiliated Sub-Adviser.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 15(a) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for any person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company except pursuant to a written contract that has been approved by the vote of a majority of the company's outstanding voting securities. Rule 18f-2 under the Act provides that each series or class of stock in a series investment company affected by a matter must approve that matter if the Act requires shareholder approval.
2. Form N-1A is the registration statement used by open-end investment companies. Item 19(a)(3) of Form N-1A requires disclosure of the method and amount of the investment adviser's compensation.
3. Rule 20a-1 under the Act requires proxies solicited with respect to an investment company to comply with Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”). Items 22(c)(1)(ii), 22(c)(1)(iii), 22(c)(8) and 22(c)(9) of Schedule 14A, taken together, require a proxy statement for a shareholder meeting at which the advisory contract will be voted upon to include the “rate of compensation of the investment adviser,” the “aggregate amount of the investment adviser's fees,” a description of the “terms of the contract to be acted upon,” and, if a change in the advisory fee is proposed, the existing and proposed fees and the difference between the two fees.
4. Regulation S-X sets forth the requirements for financial statements required to be included as part of a registered investment company's registration statement and shareholder reports filed with the Commission. Sections 6-07(2)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation S-X require a registered investment company to include in its financial statement information about the investment advisory fees.
5. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions from any provisions of the Act, or from any rule thereunder, if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that the requested relief meets this standard for the reasons discussed below.
6. Applicants assert that the shareholders expect the Adviser, subject to the review and approval of the Board, to select the Sub-Advisers who are best suited to achieve the Subadvised Fund's investment objective. Applicants assert that, from the perspective of the shareholder, the role of the Sub-Adviser is substantially equivalent to the role of the individual portfolio managers employed by an investment adviser to a traditional investment company. Applicants state that requiring shareholder approval of each Sub-Advisory Agreement would impose unnecessary delays and expenses on the Subadvised Funds, and enable the Subadvised Fund to act more quickly when the Board and the Adviser believe that a change would benefit a Subadvised Fund and its shareholders. Applicants note that the Investment Advisory Agreements and any Sub-Advisory Agreement with an Affiliated Sub-Adviser (if any) will continue to be subject to the shareholder approval requirements of section 15(a) of the Act and rule 18f-2 under the Act.
7. Applicants assert that the requested disclosure relief would benefit shareholders of the Subadvised Funds because it would improve the Adviser's ability to negotiate the fees paid to Sub-Advisers. Applicants state that the Adviser may be able to negotiate rates that are below a Sub-Adviser's “posted” amounts, if the Adviser is not required to disclose the Sub-Advisers' fees to the public. Applicants submit that the requested relief will encourage Sub-Advisers to negotiate lower subadvisory fees with the Adviser if the lower fees are not required to be made public.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. Before a Subadvised Fund may rely on the order requested herein, the operation of the Subadvised Fund in the manner described in this application will be approved by a majority of the Subadvised Fund's outstanding voting securities as defined in the Act or, in the case of a Subadvised Fund whose public shareholders purchase shares on the basis of a prospectus containing the disclosure contemplated by condition 2 below, by the initial shareholder before such Subadvised Fund's shares are offered to the public.
2. The prospectus for each Subadvised Fund will disclose the existence, substance, and effect of any order granted pursuant to the application. In addition, each Subadvised Fund will hold itself out to the public as employing a Multi-Manager Structure. The prospectus will prominently disclose that the Adviser has the ultimate responsibility, subject to oversight by the Board, to oversee the Sub-Advisers and recommend their hiring, termination, and replacement.
3. Within ninety days of the hiring of a new Sub-Adviser, shareholders of the relevant Subadvised Fund will be furnished all information about the new Sub-Adviser that would be included in a proxy statement, except as modified to permit Aggregate Fee Disclosure. This information will include Aggregate Fee Disclosure and any change in disclosure caused by the addition of a new Sub-Adviser. To meet this obligation, each Subadvised Fund will provide its shareholders, within 90 days of the hiring of a new Sub-Adviser, an information statement meeting the requirements of Regulation 14C, Schedule 14C and Item 22 of Schedule 14A under the 1934 Act, except as modified by the order to permit Aggregate Fee Disclosure.
4. The Adviser will not enter into a Sub-Advisory Agreement with any Affiliated Sub-Adviser without that agreement, including the compensation to be paid thereunder, being approved by the shareholders of the applicable Subadvised Fund.
5. At all times, at least a majority of the Board will be Independent Trustees, and the nomination of new or additional Independent Trustees will be placed within the discretion of the then-existing Independent Trustees.
6. Independent legal counsel, as defined in rule 0-1(a)(6) under the Act, will be engaged to represent the Independent Trustees. The selection of such counsel will be within the discretion of the then-existing Independent Trustees.
7. Whenever a Sub-Adviser change is proposed for a Subadvised Fund with an Affiliated Sub-Adviser, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will make a separate finding, reflected in the Board minutes, that the change is in the best interests of the Subadvised Fund and its shareholders, and does not involve a conflict of interest from which the Adviser or the Affiliated Sub-Adviser derives an inappropriate advantage.
8. Whenever a Sub-Adviser is hired or terminated, the Adviser will provide the Board with information showing the expected impact on the profitability of the Adviser.Start Printed Page 50776

9. The Adviser will provide general management services to each Subadvised Fund, including overall supervisory responsibility for the general management and investment of the Subadvised Fund's assets and, subject to review and approval of the Board, will: (a) Set the Subadvised Fund's overall investment strategies; (b) evaluate, select and recommend Sub-Advisers to manage all or a portion of the Subadvised Fund's assets; (c) allocate and, when appropriate, reallocate the Subadvised Fund's assets among Sub-Advisers; (d) monitor and evaluate the Sub-Advisers' performance; and (e) implement procedures reasonably designed to ensure that Sub-Advisers comply with the Subadvised Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions.
10. No trustee or officer of a Subadvised Fund or director or officer of the Adviser, will own directly or indirectly (other than through a pooled investment vehicle that is not controlled by such person) any interest in a Sub-Adviser except for (a) ownership of interests in the Adviser or any entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Adviser; or (b) ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding securities of any class of equity or debt of any publicly traded company that is either a Sub-Adviser or an entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a Sub-Adviser.
11. Each Subadvised Fund will disclose in its registration statement the Aggregate Fee Disclosure.
12. In the event the Commission adopts a rule under the Act providing substantially similar relief to that in the order requested in the application, the requested order will expire on the effective date of that rule.
13. The Adviser will provide the Board, no less frequently than quarterly, with information about the profitability of the Adviser on a per Subadvised Fund basis. The information will reflect the impact on profitability of the hiring or termination of any Sub-Adviser during the applicable quarter.
14. For Subadvised Funds that pay fees to a Sub-Adviser directly from Fund assets, any changes to a Sub-Advisory Agreement that would result in an increase in the total management and advisory fees payable by a Subadvised Fund will be required to be approved by the shareholders of the Subadvised Fund.

1.
     Applicants also request relief with respect to any other existing or future registered open-end management investment company or series thereof that: (a) Is advised by the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser (collectively, the “Adviser”) or its successors; (b) uses the multi-manager structure (“Multi-Manager Structure”) described in the application; and (c) complies with the terms and conditions of this application (together with any Funds that currently use the Multi-Manager Structure, each a “Subadvised Fund” and collectively, the “Subadvised Funds”). The only existing registered open-end management investment companies that currently intend to rely on the requested order are named as applicants. For purposes of the requested order, “successor” is limited to an entity or entities that result from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization. If the name of any Subadvised Fund contains the name of a Sub-Adviser (as defined below), the name of the Adviser will precede the name of the Sub-Adviser.

3.

Applicants acknowledge that the requested relief will not extend to any such subadvisory agreement with Morningstar Associates.

                                                     Thank you for these wonderful PAX tests!  I failed the PAX three times before I discovered you website.I took all your pracitce tests and this time I passed!!!

I start nursing school in 2 months.  Thanks again!
                                                     -- Natalie C., Florida



                                                        Thanks so much!!! I wouldn't have been able to get through 
                                                        this without the help I got from your tests.  I always panic when go 
                                                        to take a test, but after taking all of your tests I was relaxed and 
                                                        focused when it came time to take the actual exam. I can not thank you 
                                                        enough!
                                                    -- Jane



                                                        I was very apprehensive about taking my exam since I am 
                                                        squeamish with any kind of testing. By using your testing prep, I can 
                                                        tell you that I went into the test with a lot of ease and confidence. I 
                                                        would not have been ready for the kind of questions that were on the test. 
                                                        I just wish I knew about this program years ago when I took my other exams and 
                                                        was not as prepared as I would have been if I used your product. 
                                                        Thank you so much!
                                                    -- Karen

Top 10 reasons PAXpractice.com is #1









PAXpractice.com was created to focus solely on  the  NLN PAX-PN (Practical Nurse)  test.  All practice test questions parallel the topics covered on the real test, are in the right proportion, 
                                                    as outlined in National League for Nursing's published NLN PAX-PN (Practical Nurse) test blueprints.
                                                                  


                                           

		
                                        	Our practice tests are designed to have a similar look-and-feel of the real test. The number of questions and the time limit for each practice exam are just like the real thing.  So when you take the actual test, you will already be completely familiar with its navigation and behavior.                   


                                           

		
                                        	We offer a total of 15  full-length practice tests.  Each full-length practice test has 160 questions.  That's a total of 2,400 practice questions to prepare you for the real test!                   


                                           

		
                                        	The low cost!  The cost of ordering 5 practice tests is less than the cost of taking the real NLN PAX-PN (Practical Nurse)  test.  In other words, it would cost you less money to order  5  practice tests, than if you failed the real test and had to retake it.  Now that is a bargain!
