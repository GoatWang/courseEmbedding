What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

^ a b Rutishauser, Arthur. "Die neuen Herren der BSI und ihre Vergangenheit" (in German). Sonntagszeitung. Retrieved 10 January 2015. Der grösste Insiderfall – allerdings kein strafbarer, sondern ein cleverer – ist, wie Esteves zu seiner Bank kam, an der er 27 Prozent be sitzt und die er beherrscht. Er verkaufte die Bank 2006 der UBS für 3,1 Milliarden Franken. Zwei Jahre später kaufte er sie für 2,5 Milliarden zurück und brachte sie 2012 für 14 Milliar den Dollar an die Börse. Verantwortlich für den Kauf der Pactual war 2006 der damaligen UBS-Investmentbanking chef Hew Jenkins. Jenkins wur de da mals kurzzeitig zum Chef von Esteves. Es war unter seiner Ägide, als die UBS einen grossen Teil der Schrott-Hypotheken kaufte, die bei der UBS zu den 60 Milliarden Franken Abschreibungen und letztlich zum Eingreifen des Staates führten.

Before working for Finma, Mr Branson held a number of senior positions at UBS, including working as chief financial officer of its wealth management and Swiss bank business. He was also in charge of UBS’s Japanese securities unit between 2006 and 2008, a period during which employees at the division were involved in attempts to manipulate Libor. As a result, he faced calls to step down in 2012 after UBS reached a SFr1.4bn settlement with a number of regulators, including Finma, over allegations that it had manipulated interbank rates on an “epic” scale.

Les 2000 employés de BSI pouvaient regarder de l’avant, Generali tourner la page, BTG Pactual se féliciter d’avoir payé un montant jugé dérisoire par nombre d’observateurs – 1,5 milliard de francs pour 89 milliards sous gestion – et la Suisse se réjouir d’attirer encore des banques étrangères. Presque un an plus tard, le rachat doit toujours être validé par la Finma. Si le délai peut sembler long, c’est que le feu vert de l’autorité de surveillance des marchés financiers est lié, en partie, au dossier fiscal américain. Or, BSI a conclu un accord à 211 millions de dollars avec la justice américaine (DoJ) fin mars. Ce qui devrait lui permettre, espère-t-elle dans son rapport annuel publié dans la foulée, d’entériner la transaction rapidement. «La clôture du dossier américain était l’une des préconditions au rachat de BTG», souligne ainsi une source proche du dossier.

André Esteves, o bilionário fundador do BTG Pactual do Brasil, foi processado por um ex-funcionário em Hong Kong, que alega que lhe foram prometidas uma parceria e ações por conseguir investidores antes da venda inicial de ações do banco. Zeljko Ivic alegou que o Banco BTG Pactual SA, o presidente e CEO Esteves e Huw Jenkins, um sócio-gerente, fizeram deturpações fraudulentas para que ele assinasse acordos com o banco de investimentos, conforme uma ação judicial apresentada perante o Supremo Tribunal de Hong Kong. 
^ Wong, Douglas (15 May 2014). "BTG Billionaire Esteves Sued in Hong Kong by Ex-Employee - Bloomberg". Bloomberg L.P. Retrieved 10 January 2015. Andre Esteves, the billionaire founder of Brazil’s BTG Pactual, was sued by a former employee in Hong Kong who claims he was promised a partnership and stock for securing investors before the bank’s initial share sale. Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur. BTG Pactual doesn’t comment on matters under litigation, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in an e-mail response to queries. Shares of the company fell 0.7 percent to 32.22 reais at 10:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Ivic is seeking more than $20 million as damages for the value of the shares and partnership promised, as well as unpaid bonuses, his lawyer Robert Tibbo said.

Competitive Advantages and Strategy
BTG Pactual Group | Competitive Advantages and Strategy



Competitive Advantages
Strategy

Competitive Advantages
BTG Pactual Group’s competitive strengths include:

Substantial presence in Brazil, where BTG Pactual Group is a dominant Investment Bank, Asset Manager and Wealth Manager, with a leading franchise in the businesses it operates. BTG Pactual Group is one of the leading players in Brazil’s financial services industry, which it believes to be one of the most attractive financial services markets globally. Given its substantial presence in Brazil, BTG Pactual Group believes that it is positioned to participate in the vast majority of significant merger and acquisition, financial advisory and capital markets transactions involving Brazilian companies. It operates in Brazil through BTG Pactual Group, one of the premier brands for investment banking and asset management in Brazil and one of the largest independent investment banks based in the emerging markets.
Established international Asset Management platform. BTG Pactual Group has an international asset management platform in London, New York and Hong Kong that, together with its S�o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro offices, provides Brazilian, emerging market and global investment products and services to its local and international client base.
Broad network of international contacts. The members of the Consortium who have invested in BTG Pactual Group’s equity in December 2010 include affiliates of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd (GIC), China Investment Corporation (CIC), Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board (OTPP), and Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC). These investors provide it with a broad range of business contacts throughout Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North and South America, and since their entrance into its capital structure, it has successfully leveraged these contacts to strengthen many of its principal businesses and realize additional revenues.
Distinctive culture stressing intellectual capital, meritocracy, entrepreneurship and an unprecedented alignment of interests. BTG Pactual Group operates under a partnership model and a flat management structure that emphasizes the value of intellectual capital, entrepreneurship and meritocracy. BTG Pactual Group believes this model is the key to its success.
Track record of strong growth with consistent profitability through various economic cycles while maintaining strong capital ratios and rigorous risk controls. While BTG Pactual Group has generated strong and consistent earnings, it also focus on consistently maintaining strong capital ratios and an adequate risk profile. BTG Pactual Group believes that its track record of consistently maintaining a higher capital ratio than that required by the Central Bank while consistently generating attractive returns on equity highlights its ability to deploy capital efficiently.
Experienced management team and motivated work force. BTG Pactual Group has a group of highly talented professionals with a strong reputation in the Brazilian and international financial markets. This group was responsible for establishing and implementing the strategies that permitted BTG Pactual Group to become one of Brazil’s leading financial institutions.
Diversified portfolio of businesses. BTG Pactual Group believes it has successfully diversified its business operations and sources of revenues to maximize opportunities for leveraging its client relationships across business units, as well as to best position itself to exploit any changes in market conditions.
Strong and diversified funding base with proven asset-liability management. BTG Pactual Group has a solid and diversified base for funding its operations through its private banking network, institutional client base, corporate client base, and in the capital markets which allows it consistently able to fund its operations and to manage its liquidity risk maintaining a strong cash position, which is always sufficient to run its operations for 90 days assuming that it does not obtain new funding.

Top
Strategy
BTG Pactual Group seeks to implement the following strategies:

Capitalize on Brazil’s outstanding growth perspectives. BTG Pactual Group believes that Brazil has all of the conditions necessary to achieve outstanding growth in the financial services sector. These conditions include (i) a favorable macroeconomic environment and political stability; (ii) sound institutional and regulatory framework; (iii) improved corporate governance; (iv) a sophisticated and deep domestic financial market; (v) a highly attractive investment environment; (vi) a growing middle market and middle income consumer base; and (vii) numerous companies well-positioned to continue to grow and tap international markets.
Maintain its distinctive culture and create an unprecedented alignment of interests between partners and shareholders. In contrast to other investment banking and asset management firms in Brazil and worldwide that have sold equity to the general market in the past, BTG Pactual Group has implemented several concrete steps to maintain its partnership model.
Take advantage of attractive growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions. BTG Pactual Group intends to expand through selective acquisitions. It expects to focus on acquisitions that are complementary to its existing businesses, and that offer opportunities for growth and earnings accretion.
Expand its international operations. BTG Pactual Group’s presence in important financial markets such as S�o Paulo, New York, London and Hong Kong enables it to better explore business opportunities arising in different regions and demonstrates its intent to continuously seek diversification. BTG Pactual Group believes there are attractive opportunities for selective continued expansion outside Brazil and intend to pursue these opportunities. It believes, for example, that its strong reputation and global presence will allows it to (i) expand its marketing of Brazilian and emerging markets asset management products to a global customer base, (ii) expand its investment banking business to other Latin American countries, (iii) attract additional talent and teams with experience in markets and products outside of Brazil where it currently does not have significant expertise, and (iv) expand the business that it conducts internationally with Latin American companies that are expanding globally.
Selectively expand its portfolio of credit products and derivatives. BTG Pactual Group plans to expand its offering of credit products and derivatives to its current and prospective clients, including through its commercial banking platform (PanAmericano). BTG Pactual Group expects to primarily exploit credit opportunities that are linked to its other core business units - in particular investment banking - and also those that involve structured products and derivatives. BTG Pactual Group intends to continue to analyze credit opportunities closely, performing rigorous analyses of prospective borrowers’ businesses and existing and prospective financial condition and results, in order to select opportunities which will satisfy its stringent standards for achieving high returns within acceptable risk parameters. BTG Pactual Group considers Banco PanAmericano’s origination platform another step in implementing these strategies, as such platform originates consumer finance and middle market assets on a primary basis that are complementary to the credit that it originate through Banco BTG Pactual’s platform.
Continue to develop its Merchant Banking and Private Equity businesses. BTG Pactual Group believes that its ability to provide permanent capital to its clients is an important competitive advantage. Accordingly, BTG Pactual Group intends to continue to develop its merchant banking and private equity businesses, primarily with respect to investments in Brazil.

From acquisition to disposal, the Sage Fixed Assets family delivers a powerful, 
          easy-to-use fixed asset management solution to organizations of all sizes.


Total fixed asset management from acquisition through disposal
Easy-to-use solutions for asset accounting, construction-in-progress, inventory, and reporting
Specialized for your commercial business, nonprofit organization, or government entity













Depreciation
Tracking
Planning
Reporting





Depreciation is an easy-to-use, fixed asset tracking and depreciation solution that empowers you to more easily manage fixed assets throughout their life cycle.
It helps you eliminate time-consuming manual computations, reduces the risk of errors, and aids decision making with easy, accurate reporting. From simple office fixtures to the most complex plant and equipment, Sage Fixed Assets—Depreciation helps you acquire, track, depreciate, and ultimately dispose of any fixed asset in your business.

Comprehensive depreciation engine contains more than 300,000 IRS and GAAP rules
Over 50 methods of depreciation including user-defined depreciation methods
Flexible and customizable to help you work faster and smarter with user-definable fields, asset templates to speed new asset creation, and "Smart Lists"
Includes more than 30 ready-to-use fixed asset reports and fileable IRS tax forms—unlimited custom reporting is available with the optional Sage Fixed Assets—Reporting
Sage Fixed Assets—Depreciation is also available for nonprofit organizations, government and schools, and Canadian businesses



















Tracking provides automated fixed asset inventory tracking and reconciliation capabilities.
An accurate inventory is essential to your organization's internal control of fixed assets, helping to prevent theft, realize loss or damages, and ensure accurate insurance coverage (and costs). An inventory helps you eliminate accounting inaccuracies due to "ghost assets"—fixed assets that are on your books, but no longer at your company. Without conducting regular inventories, no amount of added processes, controls, or calculations can ensure the accuracy and reliability of your fixed asset accounting.

Works with state-of-the-art barcode technology for automated, easy inventories
Creates and tracks multiple physical inventories of assets quickly and efficiently
Conduct inventories concurrently at multiple locations and reconcile in a central database
Check-In/Check-Out feature with activity history enables monitoring of mobile assets
Stores photos, invoices, or other related documents for each asset



















Planning helps you take control of fixed assets before they are placed in service, by providing the ability to track components during the construction-in-progress phase of fixed asset projects such as multi-component machinery, or new buildings.
Take control of spending and streamline your project accounting. Sage Fixed Assets—Planning will keep you organized, collect and track invoices, and easily transfer completed assets to Sage Fixed Assets—Depreciation when they are ready to be placed in service.

Manage a virtually unlimited number of projects of any type or size
Track details including status, contacts, notes, and all the financials—plus monitor both physical and financial completion status of projects
Get a broad look across all projects with consolidated reports, or drill into details at the project, line-item, and transaction level
View at-a-glance budget tracking and project alerts with a convenient "Project Snapshot"
Easily accumulate and summarize numerous purchase orders, invoices, receipts, and tasks
Manage both capitalized and expensed assets
Customize Sage Fixed Assets—Planning for your business using over 45 user-defined fields



















Although all Sage Fixed Assets Business Solutions include a robust selection of pre-built fixed asset reports, many companies want to go further, building customized reports that meet unique business requirements for deeper analysis.
With Sage Fixed Assets—Reporting, you can easily access the data you want and format complete, accurate reports, and distribute them within your company.

Customize the standard reports in Sage Fixed Assets—Depreciation or create your own from scratch with an easy step-by-step reporting wizard
Reports can handle up to 999,999 assets, and you can choose an unlimited number of sort and subtotal options
Create reports that combine Sage Fixed Assets data with other data from spreadsheets or relational databases
Create eye-catching graphs or charts using Sage Fixed Assets data
Export data to Microsoft® Excel®, Lotus®, Word, Adobe® Acrobat®, WordPerfect®, ASCII files, PDF, XML, HTML, and more

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Andre Esteves, the billionaire founder of Brazil’s BTG Pactual, was sued by a former employee in Hong Kong who claims he was promised a partnership and stock for securing investors before the bank’s initial share sale. Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur. BTG Pactual doesn’t comment on matters under litigation, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in an e-mail response to queries. Shares of the company fell 0.7 percent to 32.22 reais at 10:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Andre Esteves, the billionaire founder of Brazil’s BTG Pactual, was sued by a former employee in Hong Kong who claims he was promised a partnership and stock for securing investors before the bank’s initial share sale. Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur. BTG Pactual doesn’t comment on matters under litigation, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in an e-mail response to queries. Shares of the company fell 0.7 percent to 32.22 reais at 10:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo.
