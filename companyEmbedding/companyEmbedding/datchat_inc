Our Mission


A complete Personal Privacy Platform where you are always in control, even after you hit Send or Submit
Mobile messaging, email and file storage are the first personal cyber-security sectors that DatChat is addressing with its unique proprietary technology. The DatChat's technology allows you to change the rights to your messages and personal information any time after you hit send or submit
Starting with messaging, DatChat is the first privacy platform to always allow the option to erase or change how long your messages stay on another person’s device. You are always in full control of your personal privacy with DatChat.   When sending someone a message, you can wipe it from your phone and theirs at any time.
Unique to DatChat are features such as: Screenshot Protection, "Nuke" which allows the complete eradication of a conversation on everyone’s device, multi-layered encryption and the DatChat Messaging Rights Control Platform.












The Opportunity of Privacy
The Cyber-Security industry is growing exponentially, and it is expected to reach $170 Billion in just a few years. While most of the focus seems to be on protecting our information where it is stored, DatChat is focused on Protecting Our Privacy after we have already shared our personal and financial information.
One of the biggest threats to our privacy comes from what happens after we have Hit Send, Submit or even Delete.  DatChat’s unique technology is focused on always providing privacy, control and security when you really need it the most.
The Company that puts us back in control of our personal privacy can truly change the face of communications and financial security. This protects all of us, and creates a tremendous investing opportunity. Our Patent Pending technology allows us to stay in control of our information even after
we hit Send or Submit.





Disruption





While you are probably familiar with many of the messaging and email platforms, did you know that they all share the same major privacy flaw that creates substantial risk to our personal privacy and security?
They do not allow us to control our messages or information after we Hit Send!  DatChat is ready right now, to totally disrupt the entire Cyber-Security and Messaging Industry by allowing full control of our personal and financial information both before, and especially after we hit send or submit.







Over 10,000 hours of Development


We have spent over two years developing privacy technology that is there for you when you need it the most…After You Hit Send. First we are rolling out the platform for iPhone and iMessage. This is happening now. Our goal is to work as a stand alone platform and integrate into existing messaging platforms including email.

















 Become a DatChat Ambassador Investor!
As a Special Limited Time Offer for our early investors you will get twice the amount of shares.  When you invest, you will automatically be enrolled in the DatChat Ambassador Program which entitles you to receive an equal number of stock option shares.






Unique Opportunity
For the last 80 years, private companies could only raise capital from accredited investors, the wealthiest 2% of Americans. Recently the JOBS Act was signed, Title IV (Regulation A+) of the JOBS Act went into effect, allowing private early-stage companies to raise money from everyone.
The Reg A+  offering is often referred to as a mini-IPO.  We are conducting a Reg. A+ Tier 2 offering that allows us to raise up to $50 million dollars under Title IV of the Jobs Act.  The company has had to submit Form 1-A registration statement to the SEC for qualification, and is subject to ongoing reporting requirements. Like an IPO, Reg. A+ allows companies to offer shares to the general public and not just accredited investors. The shares you purchase are immediately freely tradable.





New Communication Platform
Until Now, no messaging platform allowed you to change the rights to your messages After You HIT SEND.
Messaging Rights Management Platform: Patent pending technology allows a sender to set a message to last forever, or automatically self-destruct after a certain number of views. At any time a sender can wipe texts off a recipient’s phone or give them more time to view the message.
"Nuke" a Conversation: Users can even opt to Nuke messages, which erases both sides of the conversation on both the sender and recipient’s devices.
Encryption: All DatChat messages are encrypted with AES256 for the message, and RSA for the key to ensure your messages are only seen by you and your intended recipients. Each message is individually encrypted for the recipient and cannot be forwarded or saved. Additionally, all messages are sent and received via a SSL connection and can never be viewed by DatChat under any circumstance.
Screenshot Protection: DatChat’s Patent Pending protection mode makes it nearly impossible to screenshot a secret picture or message. Also, the sender receives notifications when someone attempts to screenshot protected or regular self destructing messages.








Nuke & Self Destructing Messages
The sender decides how many times pictures or messages can be viewed before they self-destruct. Also, the sender can dictate how many views are left or erase the content at any time. Users can even opt to Nuke messages, which erase both sides of the conversation on both the sender and recipient’s devices.



Hide in Plain Sight
Senders can hide pictures and information on the camera roll, hidden and encrypted behind other pictures. Only the cover photo can be seen in plain sight.



Screenshot Protection
DatChat features a protection mode which makes it nearly impossible to screenshot a secret message. Also, the sender receives notifications when someone attempts to screenshot protected or regular self-destructing messages.





Without a Trace
Messages vanish without a trace when they reach a view limit or are manually destructed, and are deleted forever. DatChat Inc. employees can never access messages.



Powerful Privacy
Every message sent is double encrypted and can only be viewed by the sender and the intended recipient.



Fast, Safe & Easy
It is easy to send and control messages. Camraflage is DatChat’s patent-pending technology that hides a message behind a decoy cover photo. Camraflage messages can be sent via encrypted messages using the direct messaging built into DatChat, iMessage or email.







Patent Pending

Only messenger that allows you to change how many views or time remains after sending.
Erasing both sides of a conversation on your recipients phone
Screenshots can be prevented with our anti-screenshot technology
Encrypted Text and Pictures can be added to videos that can only be viewed and decrypted by the intended recipients
Video Scrambling Technology that renders our self-destructing videos useless.






Why Reg. A+ is Perfect for DatChat?
Don’t you think it is Better to have thousands of investors that will use and help spread the word and Protect their privacy at the same time





Experienced Management Team
Team Story
Each person on the DatChat Team understands two things: First, nothing is more important than protecting our personal privacy. Second, the technology to protect our privacy has to be easy to use and always guarding us. We have assembled a team of developers, marketers and advisors to help ensure our technology and solutions put us back in control of our privacy.
The inspiration for DatChat came when Darin and Pete were asked by a friend to recover deleted messages their phone.  They were all shocked at how much data they recovered including: deleted text messages, voice mails, pictures, notes, bookmarks, visited websites and much more.  Having worked together since 2005 on personal privacy and social marketing projects, they knew the time was right to create DatChat.
Darin Myman, CEO
As a successful entrepreneur Darin Myman has developed patented privacy technology for email, developed expertise in viral and traditional marketing, run successful public relations campaigns and taken several companies from private to public.  Notably, he was a founder of BigString, Inc., the self-destructing email platform which serviced millions of customers.  Mr. Myman was also a co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of LiveInsurance.com, the first online insurance broker that pioneered the electronic storefront for large national insurance agencies. Prior to co-founding LiveInsurance.com, he served as a Vice President of the online brokerage services unit of Westminster Securities Corporation.
Peter Shelus, Founder and Chief Technology Officer
Mr. Shelus has over 10 years of Self-Destructing Messaging, Social Marketing and Mobile Video development experience. As a lead engineer of the first self-destructing email, mobile and social messaging platform  “BigString”, Mr. Shelus has been a pioneer and thought leader ahead of his time in secure messaging having developed patented technology that became a cornerstone of self-destructing messaging. Mr. Shelus graduated from Rutgers University with honors and a degree in Computer Science.
Darin Myman, CEO & Peter Shelus have been ahead of their time in developing patent pending technology for ephemeral messaging and digital privacy since 2004.

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., April 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- DatChat Inc. today announced the availability of DatChat Messenger, offering an unprecedented level of privacy control for both individual and group messages.  DatChat Messenger is the first privacy messaging app that provides the option to dictate how long sent messages are accessible on the recipient's phone.  It is also the first to offer a "Nuke" option, which will erase both sides of a conversation on both the sender and recipient's devices.  








DatChat Messenger gives senders a new level of privacy and control through its customizable messaging settings.  Senders can set a message to last forever, or automatically self-destruct after a certain number of views.  At any time a sender can wipe texts off a recipient's phone or give the recipient more time to view the message.  Senders can choose to change the rights to a single message or destruct all of their messages at once.  Additional features include the ability to remain anonymous, prevent screenshots and hide pictures behind preview images on the camera roll and in the messaging stream.  
"Whether online dating or texting a colleague, we've all had those moments when we've regretted sending a message or we simply want to make sure it isn't seen by the wrong person," said Darin Myman, co-founder and CEO of DatChat Inc. "In addition to DatChat's unique privacy features, users don't have to deal with the annoyance of having a conversation one disappearing message at a time.  DatChat offers a traditional messaging experience without giving up control of shared messages and pictures."
DatChat Messenger includes the following features:

Self-Destructing Messages: The sender decides how many times pictures or messages can be viewed before they self-destruct.  Also, the sender can dictate how many views are left or erase the content at any time.  Users can even opt to Nuke messages, which erases both sides of the conversation on both the sender and recipient's devices. 

Hide in Plain Sight: Senders can hide pictures and information on the camera roll, hidden and encrypted behind other pictures.  Only the cover photo can be seen in plain sight. 

Screenshot Protection: DatChat features a protection mode which makes it nearly impossible to screenshot a secret message.  Also, the sender receives notifications when someone attempts to screenshot protected or regular self-destructing messages.

Without a Trace: Messages vanish without a trace when they reach a view limit or are manually destructed, and are deleted forever.  DatChat Inc. employees can never access messages. 

Powerful Privacy: Every message sent is double encrypted and can only be viewed by the sender and the intended recipient.  

Fast, Safe and Easy: It is easy to send and control messages. Camraflage is DatChat's patent-pending technology that hides a message behind a decoy cover photo.  Camraflage messages can be sent via encrypted messages using the direct messaging built into DatChat, iMessage or email.  

Message Security: Only the sender and intended recipients can view messages -- they cannot be forwarded to anyone else. While on the DatChat servers, they cannot be viewed by anyone because only the sender has the key.

Multiple Accounts:  Senders can have multiple accounts with friends, messages and secret pictures only visible when logged in to that respective account. 

Anonymity: No phone number, email or personal information required.  All users need is a screen name to send a message.
DatChat is a free app available at the App Store for iPhones and iPads or at DatChat.net
DatChat Inc. was founded in 2015 by a team dedicated to creating a messaging platform that always provides privacy, control and security.

Spherix Enters Into Non-Binding Letter Of Intent with Privacy Messaging Pioneer DatChat

NEW YORK, Aug. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Spherix Incorporated (NASDAQ:    SPEX) –a company committed to the fostering of technology and the monetization of intellectual property, today announced that it has entered into a non-binding letter of intent ("LOI") to invest in DatChat Inc. – a pioneer in the secure (privacy) messaging industry – in exchange for an equity security interest in DatChat.  DatChat's patent-pending encryption technology allows users to secure their messages sent between mobile devices.  Earlier this year, DatChat announced that its technology offers an unprecedented level of privacy control for both individual and group messages.  According to DatChat, its app is the first privacy messaging app that provides the option to dictate how long sent messages are accessible on the recipient's phone and is the first to offer an option that will erase both sides of a conversation on both the sender and recipient's devices, even after the information is transmitted to another user.  Currently, the DatChat app is available in the iTunes® store. 








Spherix CEO Anthony Hayes commented: "As noted in a recent Time Magazine article, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partner Mary Meeker acknowledged the messaging app trend in her widely read annual report on the state of the Internet, released earlier this year. According to the article, Meeker noted that messaging apps have the potential to become a larger part of how we access information and services on the Internet. Messaging apps, she predicts, could take over the function of the home screen as a portal to various apps.  This contemplated investment in DatChat continues our focus to diversify and build value for our holders by an investment in this exciting field.  We believe the technology of DatChat is unique and our expertise in the technology patent space may allow us to help DatChat realize its value." 
There is no assurance that the proposal will result in a binding offer being made to DatChat or that the transaction contemplated by the LOI, or any other transaction between the parties, will be completed.  The transaction is subject to customary due diligence. Consummation of the transaction is necessarily further subject to entering into a definitive agreement between the parties containing specific signing and closing terms and conditions yet to be negotiated.
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to acquire any securities, nor shall there be any sale of any securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.
About Spherix
Spherix is committed to advancing innovation by active participation in all areas of the patent market. Spherix draws on portfolios of pioneering technology patents to partner with and support product innovation. Spherix has acquired over 100 patents from Rockstar Consortium Inc., and several hundred patents issued to Harris Corporation, covering a variety of methods and components involved in switching, routing, networking, optical and telecommunication sectors.
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this press release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Words such as "may," "might," "will," "should," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "continue," "predict," "forecast," "project," "plan," "intend" or similar expressions, or statements regarding intent, belief, or current expectations, are forward-looking statements. While the Company believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on any such forward-looking statements, which are based on information available to us on the date of this release. These forward looking statements are based upon current estimates and assumptions and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including without limitation those set forth in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), not limited to Risk Factors relating to its patent business contained therein.

 Nuke & Self Destructing Messages
The sender decides how many times pictures or messages can be viewed before they self-destruct.  Also, the sender can dictate how many views are left or erase the content at any time.  Users can even opt to Nuke messages, which erase both sides of the conversation on both the sender and recipient’s devices.




visibility
Hide in Plain Sight
Senders can hide pictures and information on the camera roll, hidden and encrypted behind other pictures.  Only the cover photo can be seen in plain sight.





Screenshot Protection
DatChat features a protection mode which makes it nearly impossible to screenshot a secret message.  Also, the sender receives notifications when someone attempts to screenshot protected or regular self-destructing messages.







Without a Trace
Messages vanish without a trace when they reach a view limit or are manually destructed, and are deleted forever.  DatChat Inc. employees can never access messages.




group
Powerful Privacy
Every message sent is double encrypted and can only be viewed by the sender and the intended recipient.





Fast, Safe & Easy
It is easy to send and control messages. Camraflage is DatChat’s patent-pending technology that hides a message behind a decoy cover photo.  Camraflage messages can be sent via encrypted messages using the direct messaging built into DatChat, iMessage or email.







Message Security
Only the sender and intended recipients can view messages -- they cannot be forwarded to anyone else. While on the DatChat servers, they cannot be viewed by anyone because only the sender has the key.





Multiple Accounts
Senders can have multiple accounts with friends, messages and secret pictures visible when logged in to that respective account.





It's Free!









"I love being able to hide pictures and information right on my camera roll."
"Finally, I can easily delete my texts on the other person's phone!"
"I can send pics to my boyfriend, and destruct them if we break up. Awesome!"
"The screenshot protection has already saved me."
"Finally, destructing messages that lasts longer than ten seconds!"








DatChat Messenger is much more than Self-Destructing messages and Hidden Encrypted Pictures
DatChat Messenger with our unique “Nuke” option allows you to completely eradicate both sides of a conversation on yours and the recipient’s phone.  Leaving absolutely no trace that the conversation ever took place.  Even the messages they sent are erased from their phone.

The DatChat Messenger makes sure that you always have complete privacy and control, especially after you hit send.  You can set a message to last forever, or automatically self-destruct after a certain amount of time or number of views.  Any time you want you can change your mind and wipe your messages off the recipient’s phone or give them more time to view them.  Additional features include the ability to protect your identity, prevent screenshots and hide encrypted pictures behind decoy images on the camera roll.

New Brunswick, New Jersey – DatChat Inc. is pleased to announce the availability of DatChat Messenger 1.4.2 for iOS, offering an unprecedented level of privacy control for both individual and group messages. DatChat Messenger is the first privacy messaging app that provides the option to dictate how long sent messages are accessible on the recipient’s phone. It is also the first to offer a “Nuke” option, which will erase both sides of a conversation on both the sender and recipient’s devices. 
DatChat Messenger gives senders a new level of privacy and control through its customizable messaging settings. Senders can set a message to last forever, or automatically self-destruct after a certain number of views. At any time a sender can wipe texts off a recipient’s phone or give the recipient more time to view the message. Senders can choose to change the rights to a single message or destruct all of their messages at once. Additional features include the ability to remain anonymous, prevent screenshots and hide pictures behind preview images on the camera roll and in the messaging stream. 
“Whether online dating or texting a colleague, we’ve all had those moments when we’ve regretted sending a message or we simply want to make sure it isn’t seen by the wrong person,” said Darin Myman, co-founder and CEO of DatChat Inc. “In addition to DatChat’s unique privacy features, users don’t have to deal with the annoyance of having a conversation one disappearing message at a time. DatChat offers a traditional messaging experience without giving up control of shared messages and pictures.”
DatChat Messenger includes the following features:
* Self-Destructing Messages:
The sender decides how many times pictures or messages can be viewed before they self-destruct. Also, the sender can dictate how many views are left or erase the content at any time.
