About ELCO

Established in 1995 and based in New York, ELCO Management Company, LLC offers investment solutions for high net worth individuals and institutions. Committed to consistently delivering favorable returns for our clients, we base our investment decisions upon a research driven philosophy.


For our high net worth clients, we emphasize creating tax efficiency through positive after tax performance. We also manage two highly specialized energy funds that invest in an industry sector that is undergoing significant changes. By investing in the entire energy chain and having a deep understanding of the various energy sub-sectors, such as Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), we are able to capitalize on key market opportunities. We are forward thinking in not just investing in undervalued growth situations but also look further out in terms of the timing of the stock market's recognition of these situations.


Additionally, the combination of the funds' senior managers represents more than 80 years of investment management experience, which translates into hands-on decision-making on each security purchased within the energy universe. The experience of our portfolio managers span other sectors as well, which enable ELCO to take advantage of other industries including financial, healthcare and technology. However, both ELCO funds are invested at least 50 percent in the energy sector.



Recently, our long/short energy fund ranked #6 in the top 10 energy related funds by BarclayHedge, LTD. for the 36-month period ended March 31, 2013. We also ranked #8 for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2012.

ELCO’s Financial Services SMA Program

In December 2009, ELCO Management Co., LLC (“ELCO”) entered into a joint venture with Mendon Capital Advisors Corp (“Mendon”), a registered investment adviser whose principal, Anton Schutz and team focus their efforts on the Financial Services sector.  Mendon will primarily provide ELCO with their recommendations of selected financial institutions, which, in their opinion, are positioned to principally benefit from mergers and acquisitions. ELCO is offering separately managed accounts for investors seeking investment opportunities in this niche space.  We believe that over the next three to five years, with the proper selections, substantial capital appreciation is possible.  ELCO will also provide energy intelligence on various geographic locations which we believe will serve as a catalyst to positive economic activity.  Mendon has focused on the financial services industry since 1996.  Mr. Schutz is quoted often in the Wall Street Journal and Barron’s. He also appears frequently as a guest on CNBC.


Mendon Capital will focus primarily on regional and larger community banks rather than the major money centers given the many issues being faced by larger banks emanating from the financial crisis.  The emphasis is on institutions that have strong and or improving balance sheets with access to the capital markets, seasoned managements, acquisition know-how and minimal credit quality issues.  From time to time, Mendon will also select other banks that offer capital gains as a result of mispricing in secondary offerings.


ELCO, acting as the Investment Advisor, will provide total transparency and 30-day liquidity to these separately managed accounts. Pershing, LLC acts as custodian.

Investment Strategy 

To maximize the risk/return ratio Positions are actively managed to maximize total return potential
To capitalize on the longer-term investment horizon unique to energy value chain assets- a capital intensive industry providing essential services 
Take advantage of shorter term themes through a discipline approach within a relative value framework 
Capitalize on event driven opportunities 
The investment strategy is managed for all market environments, emphasizing both top-down macro analysis and bottom-up fundamental research 
Total return focus with an emphasis on current income in a risk controlled framework 

Investment Process 

ELCO employs sector expertise and an intensive bottom-up fundamental research driven process 
Top down themes are developed by analyzing current industry trends 
Positions are modelled and selected on several criteria including: 


Earnings leverage to broader themes
Strength of management
Potential upside to fundamental price target
Earnings stability and growth potential
Free cash flow growth potential
Dividend/distribution coverage ratio and quality of cash flow

Risk Management 

We screen for fundamental, macro or political issues 
We sell when a change in the fundamentals place earnings at risk 
We keep the portfolio diversified to avoid concentration or systemic risks 
We reassess, then typically trim as a position nears its fundamental price target 
We employ relative downside targets 
We average down when the stock price is negatively affected by drivers which do not compromise earnings (market sentiment for instance)

Burnham Asset Management Corp.


                  Burnham Asset Management Corp. (BAM) provides investment advisory and related services that emphasize long-term strategies designed to meet each client’s specific investment objectives. Investments may include, but aren't necessarily limited to: exchange-listed, over-the-counter, domestic and foreign equity securities; warrants; commercial paper and other corporate debt securities; certificates of deposit; municipal securities; mutual fund shares; US government securities; options on securities; and investments in affiliated and unaffiliated private funds. BAM's investment approach seek to identify best-in-sector equities, specifically those with attractive business models, valuations and, where appropriate, dividend growth. For fixed income investments, the firm considers the quality of the issuer of the securities, duration, yield to maturity, the potential for ratings upgrade and refinancing, and the industry outlook. BAM applies similar criteria to municipal bonds, taking into account the quality of the credit and the borrower’s ability to pay principal and interest. ^

History



                
Since 1922            


In 1922 Elco Tool and Screw was founded in Rockford, IL, primarily to supply wood screws to the then booming local furniture manufacturing business. Over the next several decades the company continued to grow, constantly finding new markets and developing its fastener manufacturing capabilities. In the mid 1960’s a new facility was built and the name was changed to Elco Industries Inc.As the business continued to grow through the 70’s and 80’s, so did the plant. This growth, and supplying product to several distinct markets, prompted management to accommodate additional growth by physically splitting the different market segments into stand alone facilities. That led to the creation, in 1984, of Elco Construction Products (ECP) and its move to the Falcon Road address in Rockford, IL. The original products were self-drilling screws and masonry screw anchors.In the Fall of 2008 the operations on Falcon Road closed to allow expansion of manufacturing, warehousing and customer support services to the Infastech Decorah, Iowa Operations campus. Increased capabilities in Decorah better position Elco Construction Products to serve a global market.Today’s product offering has greatly expanded since inception of Elco Construction Products in 1984. Elco products can be found on some of the world's most notable structures and available globally. As we move into the future Elco Construction Products is committed to continue our heritage of developing innovative fastening technologies for metal and concrete applications.
