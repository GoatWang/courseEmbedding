No-Wait Content Publishing We don’t believe in waiting days or weeks after your live event for video on demand. Nor should you. Share the video experience within 24 hours (or less) to keep the message fresh and capitalize on your event’s excitement.










Powerful Analytics Mediasite Analytics arms you with the metrics to make informed program decisions, measure ROI and plan for future events. Monitor what content or which speakers are attracting the most views, and see exactly who is watching, when and from which devices.










Dedicated Team Before, during and after your event, our expert team is with you every step to ensure streaming success. Rely on us for turnkey webcast production or engage us as needed to work with your own event team. Either way, your success is our mission.










Affordable Scalability Easily add more sessions or tracks without a significant increase to your on-site footprint, resources or technician headcount. From single-room events to large multi-track conferences, Mediasite Events grows with you. Plus, integration with your other event platforms like social networking, registration, e-commerce or virtual environments, means you maximize your investment.
