WHAT OUR PATIENTS SAY





Dave S. 












I’ve been going to Dr. Hoffman for years and he and his staff have always treated me very well. Dr. Hoffman has always been very patient to make sure I don’t feel any pain. I can’t recommend him strongly enough!








Nicole C.












Dr. Hoffman is an outstanding dentist. He's been our family dentist for 20+ years. He is gentle, skilled and very professional. Dr. Hoffman always communicates well and patiently explains any dental issues. He and the hygienists and office staff are warm and friendly and are good with my kids as well!








Leigh Ann D.












After seeing only one dentist my entire life I was apprehensive about finding a new one. It took visiting a couple others that I wasn't thrilled about before I found Dr. Hoffman. He will be my forever dentist - or at least until he retires. He's wonderful!









Welcome to The Office of Scott A. Hoffman, D.D.S., PC


Dr. Hoffman has helped hundreds of Menlo Park residents enjoy healthier, more confident smiles. His artistic hand and gentle techniques will remind you why so many generations entrust their oral health to us! Dr. Hoffman offers an comprehensive range of restorative and cosmetic procedures. Whether your goals are primarily aesthetic, or primarily about restoring function, we are dedicated to producing beautiful, durable, life-changing results. Your smile makeover is completely customizable. We often recommend combining treatments to enhance your smile’s transformation.  
Restore Your Smile
Proper tooth alignment extends the longevity of your teeth. We often recommend patients start with orthodontic treatment and whitening before completing more complex restorations. Restoring the functionality of your bite can restore more than your normal diet—it can restore your confidence and provide a more a youthful appearance. For a lasting solution to tooth loss, the gold standard is dental implants. Dr. Hoffman provides long-lasting and biocompatible implant restorations, such as All-on-4 implant supported dentures.
 
Give us a call today, we can help you change your life with a brand new smile!
 




We’re Open Early
Finding it hard to work your next dental exam into your busy schedule? Dr. Hoffman’s Menlo Park office is open early, so you can schedule a checkup before you head to the office for the day.
Call us today to make your appointment — all ages are welcome. Be sure to ask about our complimentary cosmetic consultations and 0% financing plans.
