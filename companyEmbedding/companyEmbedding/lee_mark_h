1Description







This LEE Filters SW150 Mark II Lens Adapter is designed to allow a separately available SW150 Mark II Filter Holder to connect to a Tamron SP 15-30mm f/2.8 Di VC USD lens, which then permits the use of 150mm-wide, 2mm-thick filters without vignetting. This lens adapter consists of three components, a front ring, a compression ring, and a locking ring. Placement of the lens adapter onto the lens is easily accomplished by sliding the front ring over the built-in hood with the front ring's integrated lugs positioned away from the lens body. The compression ring can then be slid over the rear of the lens until it meets the front ring. Finally, the locking ring is also slid over the rear of the lens until it can be screwed into the front ring. After that is accomplished, a SW150 Mark II Holder can then be placed over the adapter from the front of the lens for use.

This adapter simply screws into the front of lenses featuring a filter thread diameter of 77mm, and then the SW150 Mark II Holder can be fitted onto the adapter for use.

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
