microRNA Replacement Therapy

About Mirna Therapeutics

Mirna is a biopharmaceutical company focused on development of a pipeline of microRNA-based oncology therapeutics.

Mirna’s lead product candidate, MRX34, the first microRNA mimic to enter clinical development in oncology, was studied as a single agent in a multicenter Phase 1 clinical trial, which  included patients with primary liver cancer, other solid cancers, and hematological malignancies (lymphomas and leukemias). MRX34 was designed to deliver a mimic of the naturally occurring microRNA tumor suppressor miR-34, which is underexpressed in a wide variety of cancers. MRX34 entered clinical testing in 2013. In September 2016, Mirna voluntarily halted enrollment and dosing in the clinical study following multiple immune-related severe adverse events (SAEs) observed in patients dosed with MRX34 over the course of the trial.

Mirna’s owned and in-licensed intellectual property portfolio  includes at least 10 issued U.S. patents and more than 42 pending U.S. and foreign applications.

Mirna Therapeutics was founded in 2007 and is located in Austin, Texas.

microRNA Replacement Therapy

Product Development Pipeline

microRNAs are naturally occurring, short ribonucleic acid, or RNA, molecules, or oligonucleotides, that play a critical role in regulating key biological pathways. Our scientists and others at leading academic institutions identified numerous tumor suppressor microRNAs that play key roles in preventing normal cells from becoming cancerous and facilitating proper cancer immunosurveillance.

Each microRNA mimic in our pipeline is designed to replicate the activity of a single tumor suppressor miRNA and regulate the expression of key oncogenes across multiple oncogenic pathways which can prevent proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. The potential capacity to simultaneously affect multiple pathways and processes that are critical to cancer cell viability may make mimics of tumor suppressor microRNAs an important new class of anti-cancer agents. We are pursuing or have been granted therapeutic use patent claims related to several tumor suppressor microRNAs as well as composition of matter claims for multiple chemistries and structures that are, or may be used in or are contemplated for use with, our therapeutic microRNA mimics. The following chart lists the most advanced microRNA mimics in our pipeline as well as their latest stage of research and development:

About Mirna Therapeutics
Mirna Therapeutics, Inc. (Mirna) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on microRNA-directed oncology therapies. Mirna’s pipeline has broad therapeutic utility in solid and hematologic cancers, and provides opportunities for partnering and licensing. Mirna filed its first IND in Q1 2013 for its lead candidate, MRX34, and is currently conducting a Phase I Clinical Trial in patients with unresectable primary liver cancer or metastatic cancer with liver involvement.  Based on the advanced stage of Mirna’s miRNA technology, pipeline breadth and IP estate, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the emerging field of miRNA therapeutics and to have a positive impact on the future of cancer patient care.
About microRNA
microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that occur naturally in human cells. Misregulation of these critical cellular components is a frequent event in the development of genetically manifested human disease. Mirna Therapeutics is developing treatments that have the promise of being effective in humans by restoring normal miRNA function.  Read more >
About miRNA Replacement Therapy
miRNA Replacement Therapy is a new approach to treat human disease. It involves the re-introduction of a synthetic version of a miRNA that is depleted in the diseased tissue. Since the synthetic and the natural miRNA are virtually indistinguishable, miRNA-based therapeutics have the potential of not exhibiting non-specific side effects. The synthetic miRNA counteracts disease-dependent processes and induces a therapeutic response. Read more >

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.12      Net Money Flow ($)  -10,400    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Mirna Therapeutics Halts Phase 1 Clinical Study of MRX34 | Business Wire


























































Mirna Therapeutics Halts Phase 1 Clinical Study of MRX34




Management to host conference call and webcast today at 5 p.m. Eastern






September 20, 2016 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mirna Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:MIRN), a clinical stage 
      biopharmaceutical company, today announced its decision to close the 
      ongoing Phase 1 study of MRX34, its investigational microRNA therapy for 
      multiple cancers. The Company voluntarily halted enrollment and dosing 
      in the clinical study following multiple immune-related severe adverse 
      events (SAE) observed in patients dosed with MRX34 over the course of 
      the trial.
    


      “Patient safety is the primary objective of our MRX34 Phase 1 clinical 
      trial,” said President and CEO Paul Lammers, M.D., M.Sc. “We made the 
      difficult decision to close the study after a fifth, immune-related 
      serious adverse event was recently reported by one of our clinical 
      sites. This patient experienced severe (Grade 4) cytokine release 
      syndrome and is undergoing treatment. We have notified the U.S. FDA and 
      the Korean FDA of our decision and are in the process of closing the 
      trial.”
    

      Mirna also announced that it will not be initiating a translational 
      medicine study of MRX34 in melanoma patients, planned to begin later 
      this year. The Company will be further analyzing its full preclinical 
      and clinical data set, and will discuss with its advisors, as well as 
      the FDA, possible future development of MRX34 and will provide updates 
      when appropriate.
    

Conference Call Details


      To access the call, participants should dial 877-407-9079 (U.S. 
      & Canada) or 201-493-6746 (international) at least 10 minutes prior to 
      the start of the call. The call will be webcast live and may be accessed 
      from the Events 
      & Presentations section of the Company's website. An 
      archived version of the webcast will be available for replay following 
      the event.
    

About Mirna Therapeutics, Inc.


      Mirna is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing 
      microRNA-based oncology therapeutics and is the first to bring a 
      synthetic microRNA mimic into clinical development for the treatment of 
      cancer. Mirna's lead product candidate, MRX34, a mimic of naturally 
      occurring microRNA-34 (miR-34), has been studied in a Phase 1 clinical 
      trial which included patients with primary liver cancer, advanced solid 
      tumors and hematological malignancies. miR-34 is one of the most widely 
      published microRNAs and is considered a key regulator of multiple 
      oncogenes across key oncogenic pathways, with the capacity to regulate 
      more than 30 different oncogenes and repress immune checkpoint signaling 
      molecules, including PD-L1. The Company was founded in 2007 and is 
      located in Austin, Texas.
