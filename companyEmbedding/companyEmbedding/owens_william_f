Owens was born in Fort Worth, Texas, where he graduated from Paschal High School. While a sophomore in high school, Owens was appointed a Page in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressman (and later, Speaker of the House) Jim Wright. Owens was assigned by the Doorkeeper of the House to the Republican cloakroom, where he worked for notable Republicans who were serving in the House then such as George H.W. Bush, Gerald Ford and Bob Dole.
He attended Stephen F. Austin State University where he served as vice president and president of the student body. While at Stephen F. Austin State University, Owens served as a coordinator of the Students for George Bush in George H.W. Bush's unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate. It was during this campaign that Owens would first meet future President George W. Bush. Owens earned a master's degree in Public Affairs from the University of Texas, Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, where he was awarded a full two-year fellowship.
Following his graduate work, Owens accepted a position in the Washington D.C. office of Touche Ross & Co. (now Deloitte). He moved to Colorado in 1977 after accepting a position with the Gates Corporation. He later served as Executive Director of the Colorado Petroleum Association and as Executive Vice President of the Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association.
Early political career[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Owens served as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from 1982 until 1988, and as a State Senator from 1988 to 1994, representing Aurora and Arapahoe County.
While in the Legislature, Owens was active in tax reform, privatization and school choice initiatives, sponsoring the nation's third charter school law. He served as Chair of both the House and Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committees and as Chair of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) Energy Committee, as well as on NCSL’s Executive Committee.
Owens was elected to statewide office as Colorado State Treasurer in 1994, where he was responsible for managing the state's $5 billion in investment funds. He served during this time on the board of Colorado's $25 billion pension fund, the Colorado Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA).
Governorship[edit]
Owens was elected as the 40th Governor of Colorado in the 1998 governor's race, when he defeated Democratic opponent Gail Schoettler by 8,300 votes (less than one percent of ballots cast). When he was inaugurated on January 12, 1999, Owens became Colorado’s first Republican governor in 24 years. His platform was three pronged: cut taxes, repair Colorado’s aging infrastructure, and continue school accountability reforms.[2]
Tax cuts[edit]
Upon entering office, Owens worked with a legislature controlled by his own Republican party to push through the largest tax relief package in state history, amounting to $1 billion in rate cuts to the sales, personal-income, and capital-gains taxes. Owens also championed, and eventually won, the elimination of the state’s marriage penalty. By 2006, the Owens administration estimated the overall tax cuts pushed through during his Administration had saved Coloradans $3.6 billion.[2]
TRANS and T-REX[edit]
In November 1999, Owens brought his transportation funding initiative to the ballot. Called TRANS, the $1.7 billion bonding initiative accelerated future federal transportation dollars on 28 road projects across the state. The keystone project was the "TRansportation EXpansion" dubbed T-REX.
T-REX combined new road funding from TRANS to widen and expand Interstate 25 through Denver with $460 million-worth of new light rail lines to link downtown Denver with the Denver Tech Center. Through an innovative design-build concept that greatly reduced construction times, T-REX was finished in less than five years, and came in under budget.[2]
Education reform[edit]
Owens based his education reforms on expanding and empowering the already-established Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP), which had been created during the administration of Democratic predecessor Roy Romer. Owens added “accountability reports” to the tests, which provided parents with a 'school report card' to allow them to better assess the performance of Colorado's public schools.[2] He also expanded Colorado's charter school program (which he had sponsored as a State Legislator in the 1990s) as well as other school choice initiatives.
Second term[edit]
Owens won reelection in the 2002 governor's race by defeating the Democratic candidate, Boulder businessman Rollie Heath, 64%–32%—the greatest majority in Colorado history. Shortly before the election, Owens was proclaimed by National Review as "America's Best Governor".[3]
In the summer of 2002, when the Hayman Fire and Coal Seam Fire ravaged much of Western Colorado, Owens made perhaps the first major press faux-pas of his tenure. Responding to a reporter’s question following an aerial tour of the fires (“What does it look like up there?”), Owens said “It looks as if all of Colorado is burning today”.[4] Many western slope residents blamed Owens for driving away tourists with the press’s truncated version of the quote (“All of Colorado is burning”).[5]
In November 2002, Colorado voters rejected Owens’ water storage initiative, Referendum A. The referendum failed to win a single county in the state, as opponents successfully savaged the measure as a “blank check”.[2] Owens would later joke, “it takes a particularly adept Governor to lose a water referendum in the face of a 300-year drought.” While the initiative was supported by most Colorado newspapers and business groups, it was opposed by the environmental community and many on Colorado's Western Slope who feared it would lead to the Front Range using more Western Slope water.
Leading up to the 2004 primary, Owens caused some controversy in the Republican Party[by whom?] by announcing support for Bob Schaffer's run to replace retiring U.S. Senator Ben Campbell, but then endorsing Pete Coors when Coors later announced his entry two days later.[citation needed]
Democrat Bill Ritter was elected in November 2006 to replace the term-limited Owens.
Referendum C[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In 2005, Owens faced what former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm termed “the test of his time.”[2] Conflicting budget measures in Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR, which caps government spending) and the voter endorsed Amendment 23 (which mandates increases in education funding) combined with a nationwide recession to leave Colorado's budget 17 percent below 2001 levels. A “glitch” – as Owens termed it – in TABOR prevented the budget from rebounding once the recession reversed.
Owens angered some conservatives by working with moderate Republican and Democratic legislators to craft and endorse what became known as Referendum C – essentially a 5-year timeout from TABOR’s spending restrictions. National conservative leaders such as Grover Norquist and Dick Armey publicly criticized the measure and Owens’ support thereof. Referendum C passed with 52% of the vote in November 2005.[2]
While it was endorsed by every major newspaper in the state as well as the state Chamber of Commerce, it was nevertheless controversial. Owens served as Vice Chair and Chair of the Republican Governors Association, and was elected by his colleagues as Chair of the Western Governors Association.
He debated public policy in person including well publicized debates with Democratic Chair Howard Dean on the Patriot Act before the ACLU National Convention in San Francisco; with Dr. Larry Summers at the Aspen Institute; with former Illinois Governor George Ryan on the death penalty at Michigan State University; with ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero on the Patriot Act at Northwestern State University; and with Justice Adrian Hardiman, the former Chief Justice of the Irish Supreme Court on the death penalty at the University College Dublin, Ireland.
Owens was a regular participant and panelist at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing in 2005 on a panel debating U.S. foreign policy with Senators Joe Biden and Chris Dodd.
Soviet Union/Russia[edit]
Owens has been a student of the Soviet Union and Russia since the 1980s. He was a group leader for People to People International, leading groups to the Soviet Union and Russia in the 1980s and 1990s, briefing the participants on Russian politics, history, and economics. He has spoken on U.S. foreign policy at Moscow State University, Russia New University (Moscow), Kazan State University in Tatarstan, and the Kazakh-British Technical University in Almaty, Kazakhstan.
He addressed the Kazakh Senate at Astana, Kazakhstan, in 2003 and was the keynote speaker at the RAND US/Russia Business Leaders Forum in Moscow in 2004. Owens served five years on the Board of Directors and as Chair of the Strategy Committee of Far Eastern Shipping Company, a Moscow-based rail, port and container company which is listed on the Moscow exchange.
Owens has served on the Advisory Board and Chair of the Strategy and Finance Committee of the Credit Bank of Moscow.
After politics[edit]
Owens has built a successful post-politics career in the private sector. He serves as a Senior Director at the international law firm of Greenberg Traurig, LLP where he works on public policy and regulatory issues. He is on a number of public boards including Key Energy (NYSE:KEG); Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE); Bill Barrett Corporation (NYSE:BBG) and Federal Signal (NYSE:FSS). Owens served from 2007-2012 on the Supervisory Board of Russia's second largest railroad, FESCO (the Far Eastern Shipping Company) and today serves as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Credit Bank of Moscow, a $20 billion in assets Moscow-based bank which counts the World Bank and European Bank of Reconstruction and Development as shareholders.
Owens joined the University of Denver's Institute for Public Policy Studies in January 2007 as a senior fellow.
Owens was an early supporter of Mitt Romney's 2008 Presidential campaign.[6] After Romney dropped out of the race, Owens worked actively for John McCain's campaign. He endorsed Romney again for the 2012 Republican nomination and served as Co-Chair of Romney's Colorado campaign.
Family life[edit]
Owens and his wife Frances married in January 1975 and divorced in 2010. They have three children, Monica (born in 1983), Mark (born in 1986), and Brett (born in 1991).[2]

Early life[edit]

Owens was born in Fort Worth, Texas, where he graduated from Paschal High School. While a sophomore in high school, Owens was appointed a Page in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressman (and later, Speaker of the House) Jim Wright. Owens was assigned by the Doorkeeper of the House to the Republican cloakroom, where he worked for notable Republicans who were serving in the House then such as George H.W. Bush, Gerald Ford and Bob Dole.
He attended Stephen F. Austin State University where he served as vice president and president of the student body. While at Stephen F. Austin State University, Owens served as a coordinator of the Students for George Bush in George H.W. Bush's unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate. It was during this campaign that Owens would first meet future President George W. Bush. Owens earned a master's degree in Public Affairs from the University of Texas, Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, where he was awarded a full two-year fellowship.
Following his graduate work, Owens accepted a position in the Washington D.C. office of Touche Ross & Co. (now Deloitte). He moved to Colorado in 1977 after accepting a position with the Gates Corporation. He later served as Executive Director of the Colorado Petroleum Association and as Executive Vice President of the Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association.
Early political career[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Owens served as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from 1982 until 1988, and as a State Senator from 1988 to 1994, representing Aurora and Arapahoe County.
While in the Legislature, Owens was active in tax reform, privatization and school choice initiatives, sponsoring the nation's third charter school law. He served as Chair of both the House and Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committees and as Chair of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) Energy Committee, as well as on NCSL’s Executive Committee.
Owens was elected to statewide office as Colorado State Treasurer in 1994, where he was responsible for managing the state's $5 billion in investment funds. He served during this time on the board of Colorado's $25 billion pension fund, the Colorado Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA).
Governorship[edit]
Owens was elected as the 40th Governor of Colorado in the 1998 governor's race, when he defeated Democratic opponent Gail Schoettler by 8,300 votes (less than one percent of ballots cast). When he was inaugurated on January 12, 1999, Owens became Colorado’s first Republican governor in 24 years. His platform was three pronged: cut taxes, repair Colorado’s aging infrastructure, and continue school accountability reforms.[2]
Tax cuts[edit]
Upon entering office, Owens worked with a legislature controlled by his own Republican party to push through the largest tax relief package in state history, amounting to $1 billion in rate cuts to the sales, personal-income, and capital-gains taxes. Owens also championed, and eventually won, the elimination of the state’s marriage penalty. By 2006, the Owens administration estimated the overall tax cuts pushed through during his Administration had saved Coloradans $3.6 billion.[2]
TRANS and T-REX[edit]
In November 1999, Owens brought his transportation funding initiative to the ballot. Called TRANS, the $1.7 billion bonding initiative accelerated future federal transportation dollars on 28 road projects across the state. The keystone project was the "TRansportation EXpansion" dubbed T-REX.
T-REX combined new road funding from TRANS to widen and expand Interstate 25 through Denver with $460 million-worth of new light rail lines to link downtown Denver with the Denver Tech Center. Through an innovative design-build concept that greatly reduced construction times, T-REX was finished in less than five years, and came in under budget.[2]
Education reform[edit]
Owens based his education reforms on expanding and empowering the already-established Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP), which had been created during the administration of Democratic predecessor Roy Romer. Owens added “accountability reports” to the tests, which provided parents with a 'school report card' to allow them to better assess the performance of Colorado's public schools.[2] He also expanded Colorado's charter school program (which he had sponsored as a State Legislator in the 1990s) as well as other school choice initiatives.
Second term[edit]
Owens won reelection in the 2002 governor's race by defeating the Democratic candidate, Boulder businessman Rollie Heath, 64%–32%—the greatest majority in Colorado history. Shortly before the election, Owens was proclaimed by National Review as "America's Best Governor".[3]
In the summer of 2002, when the Hayman Fire and Coal Seam Fire ravaged much of Western Colorado, Owens made perhaps the first major press faux-pas of his tenure. Responding to a reporter’s question following an aerial tour of the fires (“What does it look like up there?”), Owens said “It looks as if all of Colorado is burning today”.[4] Many western slope residents blamed Owens for driving away tourists with the press’s truncated version of the quote (“All of Colorado is burning”).[5]
In November 2002, Colorado voters rejected Owens’ water storage initiative, Referendum A. The referendum failed to win a single county in the state, as opponents successfully savaged the measure as a “blank check”.[2] Owens would later joke, “it takes a particularly adept Governor to lose a water referendum in the face of a 300-year drought.” While the initiative was supported by most Colorado newspapers and business groups, it was opposed by the environmental community and many on Colorado's Western Slope who feared it would lead to the Front Range using more Western Slope water.
Leading up to the 2004 primary, Owens caused some controversy in the Republican Party[by whom?] by announcing support for Bob Schaffer's run to replace retiring U.S. Senator Ben Campbell, but then endorsing Pete Coors when Coors later announced his entry two days later.[citation needed]
Democrat Bill Ritter was elected in November 2006 to replace the term-limited Owens.
Referendum C[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In 2005, Owens faced what former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm termed “the test of his time.”[2] Conflicting budget measures in Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR, which caps government spending) and the voter endorsed Amendment 23 (which mandates increases in education funding) combined with a nationwide recession to leave Colorado's budget 17 percent below 2001 levels. A “glitch” – as Owens termed it – in TABOR prevented the budget from rebounding once the recession reversed.
Owens angered some conservatives by working with moderate Republican and Democratic legislators to craft and endorse what became known as Referendum C – essentially a 5-year timeout from TABOR’s spending restrictions. National conservative leaders such as Grover Norquist and Dick Armey publicly criticized the measure and Owens’ support thereof. Referendum C passed with 52% of the vote in November 2005.[2]
While it was endorsed by every major newspaper in the state as well as the state Chamber of Commerce, it was nevertheless controversial. Owens served as Vice Chair and Chair of the Republican Governors Association, and was elected by his colleagues as Chair of the Western Governors Association.
He debated public policy in person including well publicized debates with Democratic Chair Howard Dean on the Patriot Act before the ACLU National Convention in San Francisco; with Dr. Larry Summers at the Aspen Institute; with former Illinois Governor George Ryan on the death penalty at Michigan State University; with ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero on the Patriot Act at Northwestern State University; and with Justice Adrian Hardiman, the former Chief Justice of the Irish Supreme Court on the death penalty at the University College Dublin, Ireland.
Owens was a regular participant and panelist at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing in 2005 on a panel debating U.S. foreign policy with Senators Joe Biden and Chris Dodd.
Soviet Union/Russia[edit]
Owens has been a student of the Soviet Union and Russia since the 1980s. He was a group leader for People to People International, leading groups to the Soviet Union and Russia in the 1980s and 1990s, briefing the participants on Russian politics, history, and economics. He has spoken on U.S. foreign policy at Moscow State University, Russia New University (Moscow), Kazan State University in Tatarstan, and the Kazakh-British Technical University in Almaty, Kazakhstan.
He addressed the Kazakh Senate at Astana, Kazakhstan, in 2003 and was the keynote speaker at the RAND US/Russia Business Leaders Forum in Moscow in 2004. Owens served five years on the Board of Directors and as Chair of the Strategy Committee of Far Eastern Shipping Company, a Moscow-based rail, port and container company which is listed on the Moscow exchange.
Owens has served on the Advisory Board and Chair of the Strategy and Finance Committee of the Credit Bank of Moscow.
After politics[edit]
Owens has built a successful post-politics career in the private sector. He serves as a Senior Director at the international law firm of Greenberg Traurig, LLP where he works on public policy and regulatory issues. He is on a number of public boards including Key Energy (NYSE:KEG); Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE); Bill Barrett Corporation (NYSE:BBG) and Federal Signal (NYSE:FSS). Owens served from 2007-2012 on the Supervisory Board of Russia's second largest railroad, FESCO (the Far Eastern Shipping Company) and today serves as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Credit Bank of Moscow, a $20 billion in assets Moscow-based bank which counts the World Bank and European Bank of Reconstruction and Development as shareholders.
Owens joined the University of Denver's Institute for Public Policy Studies in January 2007 as a senior fellow.
Owens was an early supporter of Mitt Romney's 2008 Presidential campaign.[6] After Romney dropped out of the race, Owens worked actively for John McCain's campaign. He endorsed Romney again for the 2012 Republican nomination and served as Co-Chair of Romney's Colorado campaign.
Family life[edit]
Owens and his wife Frances married in January 1975 and divorced in 2010. They have three children, Monica (born in 1983), Mark (born in 1986), and Brett (born in 1991).[2]

Early life[edit]

Owens was born in Fort Worth, Texas, where he graduated from Paschal High School. While a sophomore in high school, Owens was appointed a Page in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressman (and later, Speaker of the House) Jim Wright. Owens was assigned by the Doorkeeper of the House to the Republican cloakroom, where he worked for notable Republicans who were serving in the House then such as George H.W. Bush, Gerald Ford and Bob Dole.
He attended Stephen F. Austin State University where he served as vice president and president of the student body. While at Stephen F. Austin State University, Owens served as a coordinator of the Students for George Bush in George H.W. Bush's unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate. It was during this campaign that Owens would first meet future President George W. Bush. Owens earned a master's degree in Public Affairs from the University of Texas, Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, where he was awarded a full two-year fellowship.
Following his graduate work, Owens accepted a position in the Washington D.C. office of Touche Ross & Co. (now Deloitte). He moved to Colorado in 1977 after accepting a position with the Gates Corporation. He later served as Executive Director of the Colorado Petroleum Association and as Executive Vice President of the Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association.
Early political career[edit]





This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Owens served as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from 1982 until 1988, and as a State Senator from 1988 to 1994, representing Aurora and Arapahoe County.
While in the Legislature, Owens was active in tax reform, privatization and school choice initiatives, sponsoring the nation's third charter school law. He served as Chair of both the House and Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committees and as Chair of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) Energy Committee, as well as on NCSL’s Executive Committee.
Owens was elected to statewide office as Colorado State Treasurer in 1994, where he was responsible for managing the state's $5 billion in investment funds. He served during this time on the board of Colorado's $25 billion pension fund, the Colorado Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA).
Governorship[edit]
Owens was elected as the 40th Governor of Colorado in the 1998 governor's race, when he defeated Democratic opponent Gail Schoettler by 8,300 votes (less than one percent of ballots cast). When he was inaugurated on January 12, 1999, Owens became Colorado’s first Republican governor in 24 years. His platform was three pronged: cut taxes, repair Colorado’s aging infrastructure, and continue school accountability reforms.[2]
Tax cuts[edit]
Upon entering office, Owens worked with a legislature controlled by his own Republican party to push through the largest tax relief package in state history, amounting to $1 billion in rate cuts to the sales, personal-income, and capital-gains taxes. Owens also championed, and eventually won, the elimination of the state’s marriage penalty. By 2006, the Owens administration estimated the overall tax cuts pushed through during his Administration had saved Coloradans $3.6 billion.[2]
TRANS and T-REX[edit]
In November 1999, Owens brought his transportation funding initiative to the ballot. Called TRANS, the $1.7 billion bonding initiative accelerated future federal transportation dollars on 28 road projects across the state. The keystone project was the "TRansportation EXpansion" dubbed T-REX.
T-REX combined new road funding from TRANS to widen and expand Interstate 25 through Denver with $460 million-worth of new light rail lines to link downtown Denver with the Denver Tech Center. Through an innovative design-build concept that greatly reduced construction times, T-REX was finished in less than five years, and came in under budget.[2]
Education reform[edit]
Owens based his education reforms on expanding and empowering the already-established Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP), which had been created during the administration of Democratic predecessor Roy Romer. Owens added “accountability reports” to the tests, which provided parents with a 'school report card' to allow them to better assess the performance of Colorado's public schools.[2] He also expanded Colorado's charter school program (which he had sponsored as a State Legislator in the 1990s) as well as other school choice initiatives.
Second term[edit]
Owens won reelection in the 2002 governor's race by defeating the Democratic candidate, Boulder businessman Rollie Heath, 64%–32%—the greatest majority in Colorado history. Shortly before the election, Owens was proclaimed by National Review as "America's Best Governor".[3]
In the summer of 2002, when the Hayman Fire and Coal Seam Fire ravaged much of Western Colorado, Owens made perhaps the first major press faux-pas of his tenure. Responding to a reporter’s question following an aerial tour of the fires (“What does it look like up there?”), Owens said “It looks as if all of Colorado is burning today”.[4] Many western slope residents blamed Owens for driving away tourists with the press’s truncated version of the quote (“All of Colorado is burning”).[5]
In November 2002, Colorado voters rejected Owens’ water storage initiative, Referendum A. The referendum failed to win a single county in the state, as opponents successfully savaged the measure as a “blank check”.[2] Owens would later joke, “it takes a particularly adept Governor to lose a water referendum in the face of a 300-year drought.” While the initiative was supported by most Colorado newspapers and business groups, it was opposed by the environmental community and many on Colorado's Western Slope who feared it would lead to the Front Range using more Western Slope water.
Leading up to the 2004 primary, Owens caused some controversy in the Republican Party[by whom?] by announcing support for Bob Schaffer's run to replace retiring U.S. Senator Ben Campbell, but then endorsing Pete Coors when Coors later announced his entry two days later.[citation needed]
Democrat Bill Ritter was elected in November 2006 to replace the term-limited Owens.
Referendum C[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In 2005, Owens faced what former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm termed “the test of his time.”[2] Conflicting budget measures in Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR, which caps government spending) and the voter endorsed Amendment 23 (which mandates increases in education funding) combined with a nationwide recession to leave Colorado's budget 17 percent below 2001 levels. A “glitch” – as Owens termed it – in TABOR prevented the budget from rebounding once the recession reversed.
Owens angered some conservatives by working with moderate Republican and Democratic legislators to craft and endorse what became known as Referendum C – essentially a 5-year timeout from TABOR’s spending restrictions. National conservative leaders such as Grover Norquist and Dick Armey publicly criticized the measure and Owens’ support thereof. Referendum C passed with 52% of the vote in November 2005.[2]
While it was endorsed by every major newspaper in the state as well as the state Chamber of Commerce, it was nevertheless controversial. Owens served as Vice Chair and Chair of the Republican Governors Association, and was elected by his colleagues as Chair of the Western Governors Association.
He debated public policy in person including well publicized debates with Democratic Chair Howard Dean on the Patriot Act before the ACLU National Convention in San Francisco; with Dr. Larry Summers at the Aspen Institute; with former Illinois Governor George Ryan on the death penalty at Michigan State University; with ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero on the Patriot Act at Northwestern State University; and with Justice Adrian Hardiman, the former Chief Justice of the Irish Supreme Court on the death penalty at the University College Dublin, Ireland.
Owens was a regular participant and panelist at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, appearing in 2005 on a panel debating U.S. foreign policy with Senators Joe Biden and Chris Dodd.
Soviet Union/Russia[edit]
Owens has been a student of the Soviet Union and Russia since the 1980s. He was a group leader for People to People International, leading groups to the Soviet Union and Russia in the 1980s and 1990s, briefing the participants on Russian politics, history, and economics. He has spoken on U.S. foreign policy at Moscow State University, Russia New University (Moscow), Kazan State University in Tatarstan, and the Kazakh-British Technical University in Almaty, Kazakhstan.
He addressed the Kazakh Senate at Astana, Kazakhstan, in 2003 and was the keynote speaker at the RAND US/Russia Business Leaders Forum in Moscow in 2004. Owens served five years on the Board of Directors and as Chair of the Strategy Committee of Far Eastern Shipping Company, a Moscow-based rail, port and container company which is listed on the Moscow exchange.
Owens has served on the Advisory Board and Chair of the Strategy and Finance Committee of the Credit Bank of Moscow.
After politics[edit]
Owens has built a successful post-politics career in the private sector. He serves as a Senior Director at the international law firm of Greenberg Traurig, LLP where he works on public policy and regulatory issues. He is on a number of public boards including Key Energy (NYSE:KEG); Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE); Bill Barrett Corporation (NYSE:BBG) and Federal Signal (NYSE:FSS). Owens served from 2007-2012 on the Supervisory Board of Russia's second largest railroad, FESCO (the Far Eastern Shipping Company) and today serves as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Credit Bank of Moscow, a $20 billion in assets Moscow-based bank which counts the World Bank and European Bank of Reconstruction and Development as shareholders.
Owens joined the University of Denver's Institute for Public Policy Studies in January 2007 as a senior fellow.
Owens was an early supporter of Mitt Romney's 2008 Presidential campaign.[6] After Romney dropped out of the race, Owens worked actively for John McCain's campaign. He endorsed Romney again for the 2012 Republican nomination and served as Co-Chair of Romney's Colorado campaign.
Family life[edit]
Owens and his wife Frances married in January 1975 and divorced in 2010. They have three children, Monica (born in 1983), Mark (born in 1986), and Brett (born in 1991).[2]

Early life[edit]
William Ryan Owens was born March 5, 1980 in Peoria, Illinois.[1] He grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Chillicothe, Illinois, northeast of Peoria.[1][2] According to the Miami Herald, his parents worked at the Fort Lauderdale Police Department, where his father was a policeman and his mother was a detective.[2] Owens attended Illinois Valley Central High School, and graduated in 1998.[1]
Career[edit]
Owens joined the United States Navy on August 24, 1998.[1][3] He served in the Office of Naval Intelligence in Suitland, Maryland, and joined the Navy SEALs in 2002.[3] He was on five tours of duty during the course of his career as a Navy SEAL.[3] He became a chief petty officer in 2009,[3] and he was promoted to senior chief petty officer a week after his death.[4]
Owens was the recipient of two Bronze Star Medals, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Achievement Medal, the Commendation Medal, the Sea Service Ribbon, and three Presidential Unit Citations.[3][5]
Death[edit]
Owens died of wounds as a result of the Yakla raid, a U.S.-led Special Operations Forces attack in Al Bayda province in central Yemen,[6] a terrorism-related mission during the Yemeni Civil War, on January 29, 2017.[7][1][3][1] He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery[8]
Tributes and controversy[edit]
On hearing of his death, Rear Admiral Timothy Szymanski, Commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, called Owens "an exceptional SEAL—an experienced warrior and a highly respected teammate who served silently, nobly and bravely through several combat deployments." He went on to express that "Ryan's legacy strengthens our own resolve and commitment to this crucial fight. We hope his family can find comfort in the love and support of Family, Friends and Teammates."[1] President Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka Trump paid their respects on the arrival of Owens' remains at the Dover Air Force Base.[2][5] The President said, "My deepest thoughts and humblest prayers are with the family of this fallen service member."[1]
President Trump paid tribute to Owens during his address to a joint session of Congress on February 28, 2017, saying, "Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity."[9]
Owen's father, William Owens, who is a military veteran, refused to meet with President Trump and asked for an investigation into his son's death. He stated "I didn't want to make a scene about it, but my conscience wouldn't let me talk to him [Trump]."[10] He also criticized Trump for refusing to order an investigation saying "Don't hide behind my son's death to prevent an investigation."[10]
Ryan had become friends with San Francisco Giants pitcher Javier Lopez during a spring training visit. Javier Lopez described Ryan as "his counselor". His family collectively threw out the first pitch before the Giants 2017 home opener.
Personal life[edit]
Owens was married to Carryn Owens and they had three children together.[1][2]

Early life[edit]
William Ryan Owens was born March 5, 1980 in Peoria, Illinois.[1] He grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Chillicothe, Illinois, northeast of Peoria.[1][2] According to the Miami Herald, his parents worked at the Fort Lauderdale Police Department, where his father was a policeman and his mother was a detective.[2] Owens attended Illinois Valley Central High School, and graduated in 1998.[1]
Career[edit]
Owens joined the United States Navy on August 24, 1998.[1][3] He served in the Office of Naval Intelligence in Suitland, Maryland, and joined the Navy SEALs in 2002.[3] He was on five tours of duty during the course of his career as a Navy SEAL.[3] He became a chief petty officer in 2009,[3] and he was promoted to senior chief petty officer a week after his death.[4]
Owens was the recipient of two Bronze Star Medals, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Achievement Medal, the Commendation Medal, the Sea Service Ribbon, and three Presidential Unit Citations.[3][5]
Death[edit]
Owens died of wounds as a result of the Yakla raid, a U.S.-led Special Operations Forces attack in Al Bayda province in central Yemen,[6] a terrorism-related mission during the Yemeni Civil War, on January 29, 2017.[7][1][3][1] He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery[8]
Tributes and controversy[edit]
On hearing of his death, Rear Admiral Timothy Szymanski, Commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, called Owens "an exceptional SEAL—an experienced warrior and a highly respected teammate who served silently, nobly and bravely through several combat deployments." He went on to express that "Ryan's legacy strengthens our own resolve and commitment to this crucial fight. We hope his family can find comfort in the love and support of Family, Friends and Teammates."[1] President Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka Trump paid their respects on the arrival of Owens' remains at the Dover Air Force Base.[2][5] The President said, "My deepest thoughts and humblest prayers are with the family of this fallen service member."[1]
President Trump paid tribute to Owens during his address to a joint session of Congress on February 28, 2017, saying, "Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity."[9]
Owen's father, William Owens, who is a military veteran, refused to meet with President Trump and asked for an investigation into his son's death. He stated "I didn't want to make a scene about it, but my conscience wouldn't let me talk to him [Trump]."[10] He also criticized Trump for refusing to order an investigation saying "Don't hide behind my son's death to prevent an investigation."[10]
Ryan had become friends with San Francisco Giants pitcher Javier Lopez during a spring training visit. Javier Lopez described Ryan as "his counselor". His family collectively threw out the first pitch before the Giants 2017 home opener.
Personal life[edit]
Owens was married to Carryn Owens and they had three children together.[1][2]

Early life[edit]
William Ryan Owens was born March 5, 1980 in Peoria, Illinois.[1] He grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Chillicothe, Illinois, northeast of Peoria.[1][2] According to the Miami Herald, his parents worked at the Fort Lauderdale Police Department, where his father was a policeman and his mother was a detective.[2] Owens attended Illinois Valley Central High School, and graduated in 1998.[1]
Career[edit]
Owens joined the United States Navy on August 24, 1998.[1][3] He served in the Office of Naval Intelligence in Suitland, Maryland, and joined the Navy SEALs in 2002.[3] He was on five tours of duty during the course of his career as a Navy SEAL.[3] He became a chief petty officer in 2009,[3] and he was promoted to senior chief petty officer a week after his death.[4]
Owens was the recipient of two Bronze Star Medals, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Achievement Medal, the Commendation Medal, the Sea Service Ribbon, and three Presidential Unit Citations.[3][5]
Death[edit]
Owens died of wounds as a result of the Yakla raid, a U.S.-led Special Operations Forces attack in Al Bayda province in central Yemen,[6] a terrorism-related mission during the Yemeni Civil War, on January 29, 2017.[7][1][3][1] He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery[8]
Tributes and controversy[edit]
On hearing of his death, Rear Admiral Timothy Szymanski, Commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, called Owens "an exceptional SEAL—an experienced warrior and a highly respected teammate who served silently, nobly and bravely through several combat deployments." He went on to express that "Ryan's legacy strengthens our own resolve and commitment to this crucial fight. We hope his family can find comfort in the love and support of Family, Friends and Teammates."[1] President Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka Trump paid their respects on the arrival of Owens' remains at the Dover Air Force Base.[2][5] The President said, "My deepest thoughts and humblest prayers are with the family of this fallen service member."[1]
President Trump paid tribute to Owens during his address to a joint session of Congress on February 28, 2017, saying, "Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity."[9]
Owen's father, William Owens, who is a military veteran, refused to meet with President Trump and asked for an investigation into his son's death. He stated "I didn't want to make a scene about it, but my conscience wouldn't let me talk to him [Trump]."[10] He also criticized Trump for refusing to order an investigation saying "Don't hide behind my son's death to prevent an investigation."[10]
Ryan had become friends with San Francisco Giants pitcher Javier Lopez during a spring training visit. Javier Lopez described Ryan as "his counselor". His family collectively threw out the first pitch before the Giants 2017 home opener.
Personal life[edit]
Owens was married to Carryn Owens and they had three children together.[1][2]
