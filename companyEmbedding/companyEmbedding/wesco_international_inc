History[edit]
In 1922, WESCO Distribution was formed as a subsidiary of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation also based in Pittsburgh. It had existed for decades within Westinghouse as the subsidiary charged with selling and distributing company components in the electrical and industrial fields. WESCO maintained close ties to its parent. In 1994, the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) arranged for the purchase of WESCO from Westinghouse.
CD & R sold WESCO to The Cypress Group for $1.1 billion in June 1998. This group formed WESCO International, Inc., which is the current owner of WESCO Distribution.[3]
On May 12, 1999, WESCO held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, selling 9.72 million shares for $18 per share, raising $175 million.
In 2008, the company was recognized for "environmentally sustainable business practices" through an Environmental Stewardship Award from Veolia ES Technical Solutions.[4][notes 1]
In November 2010 the company acquired TVC Communications, a "distributor of broadband communications network infrastructure" for about US$250,000,000.[5]
In June, 2012 the company acquired Conney Safety for an undisclosed sum.[6][7]

History[edit]
In 1922, WESCO Distribution was formed as a subsidiary of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation also based in Pittsburgh. It had existed for decades within Westinghouse as the subsidiary charged with selling and distributing company components in the electrical and industrial fields. WESCO maintained close ties to its parent. In 1994, the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) arranged for the purchase of WESCO from Westinghouse.
CD & R sold WESCO to The Cypress Group for $1.1 billion in June 1998. This group formed WESCO International, Inc., which is the current owner of WESCO Distribution.[3]
On May 12, 1999, WESCO held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, selling 9.72 million shares for $18 per share, raising $175 million.
In 2008, the company was recognized for "environmentally sustainable business practices" through an Environmental Stewardship Award from Veolia ES Technical Solutions.[4][notes 1]
In November 2010 the company acquired TVC Communications, a "distributor of broadband communications network infrastructure" for about US$250,000,000.[5]
In June, 2012 the company acquired Conney Safety for an undisclosed sum.[6][7]

History[edit]
In 1922, WESCO Distribution was formed as a subsidiary of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation also based in Pittsburgh. It had existed for decades within Westinghouse as the subsidiary charged with selling and distributing company components in the electrical and industrial fields. WESCO maintained close ties to its parent. In 1994, the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) arranged for the purchase of WESCO from Westinghouse.
CD & R sold WESCO to The Cypress Group for $1.1 billion in June 1998. This group formed WESCO International, Inc., which is the current owner of WESCO Distribution.[3]
On May 12, 1999, WESCO held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, selling 9.72 million shares for $18 per share, raising $175 million.
In 2008, the company was recognized for "environmentally sustainable business practices" through an Environmental Stewardship Award from Veolia ES Technical Solutions.[4][notes 1]
In November 2010 the company acquired TVC Communications, a "distributor of broadband communications network infrastructure" for about US$250,000,000.[5]
In June, 2012 the company acquired Conney Safety for an undisclosed sum.[6][7]

PITTSBURGH, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE:   WCC), a leading provider of electrical, industrial, and communications MRO and OEM products, construction materials, and advanced supply chain management and logistics services, announces its results for the second quarter of 2017.








Mr. John J. Engel, WESCO's Chairman, President and CEO, commented, "Our second quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in April. Notably, we returned to organic sales growth in the quarter, after eight consecutive quarters of sales declines, driven by growth in our Industrial and CIG end markets as well as in our Canadian and International businesses. Our sales momentum accelerated as the quarter progressed, and this trend has continued into July, with all geographies growing to start the third quarter. Backlog grew sequentially in the quarter versus the typical seasonal decline, with June marking the highest monthly backlog since 2012. Operating margin was also in line with our expectations, as we continue to execute our cost management and supply chain initiatives to mitigate the effects of a still-challenging and demand-constrained pricing environment. Additionally, during the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of shares, while remaining within our targeted financial leverage band.
The first half has developed as we expected, and we are encouraged with the improving momentum of our business. Our technical capabilities and service offerings promote loyal customer relationships and growth. In the second half, as our expected growth accelerates, we plan to invest to strengthen our differentiated business model and improve our competitive advantage in 2018 and beyond. Based upon our first half results and our plan for the second half, we have narrowed our full-year expectations for sales to be up 1% to 3%, operating margin to be 4.1% to 4.3%, and EPS to be $3.60 to $3.90 per diluted share with an effective tax rate of approximately 27%. We continue to expect free cash flow generation for the year to be at least 90% of net income."
The following are results for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016:

Net sales were $1.91 billion for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016. Organic sales for the second quarter of 2017 grew by 1.0% as foreign exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 1.1%. Sequentially, net sales increased 7.7% and organic sales increased 8.0%. 
Cost of goods sold for the second quarter of 2017 was $1.54 billion and gross profit was $366.1 million, compared to cost of goods sold and gross profit of $1.53 billion and $379.5 million for the second quarter of 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 19.2% and 19.9% for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $267.3 million, or 14.0% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $274.5 million, or 14.4% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2016. 
Operating profit was $83.1 million for the current quarter, compared to $88.0 million for the second quarter of 2016. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 4.4% for the second quarter of 2017, compared to 4.6% for the second quarter of 2016. 
Interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 was $16.8 million, compared to $19.5 million for the second quarter of 2016. Non-cash interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, which includes amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing fees, and interest related to uncertain tax positions, was $1.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively. 
The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 25.3%, compared to 27.3% for the prior year second quarter. The lower effective tax rate in the current quarter as compared to the prior year's comparable quarter is primarily the result of favorable discrete items and the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 
Net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was $49.5 million and $49.8 million for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Earnings per diluted share was $1.02 for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, based on 48.8 million and 48.6 million diluted shares, respectively. 
Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2017 was $19.1 million, compared to $60.0 million for the second quarter of 2016. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2017 was $13.8 million, or 28% of net income, compared to $56.5 million, or 113% of net income, for the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, the Company completed $50 million of share repurchases in the second quarter.

The following are results for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016:

Net sales were $3.68 billion for the first six months of 2017, compared to $3.69 billion for the first six months of 2016, a decrease of 0.1%. Acquisitions had a positive impact on net sales of 0.4% and were partially offset by a 0.2% negative impact from foreign exchange rates, resulting in a 0.3% decrease in organic sales for the first six months of 2017. 
Cost of goods sold for the first six months of 2017 was $2.97 billion and gross profit was $716.1 million, compared to cost of goods sold and gross profit of $2.95 billion and $734.6 million for the first six months of 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 19.4% and 19.9% for the first six months of 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $534.3 million, or 14.5% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017, compared to $543.8 million, or 14.7% of net sales, for the first six months of 2016. 
Operating profit was $150.2 million for the first six months of 2017, compared to $157.5 million for the first six months of 2016. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 4.1% for the first six months of 2017, compared to 4.3% for the first six months of 2016. 
Interest expense for the first six months of 2017 was $33.5 million, compared to $38.3 million for the first six months of 2016. Non-cash interest expense for the first six months of 2017 and 2016, which includes amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing fees, and interest related to uncertain tax positions, was $2.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively. 
The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2017 was 25.1%, compared to 29.2% for the first six months of 2016. The current year's effective tax rate is lower than the prior year primarily due to favorable discrete items, including a benefit from the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards, as well as the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 
Net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was $87.3 million for the first six months of 2017, compared to $85.9 million for the first six months of 2016. 
Earnings per diluted share for the first six months of 2017 was $1.78, based on 49.1 million diluted shares, compared to $1.79 for the first six months of 2016, based on 47.8 million diluted shares. 
Operating cash flow for the first six months of 2017 was $66.8 million, compared to $138.6 million for the first six months of 2016. Free cash flow for the first six months of 2017 was $57.0 million, or 65% of net income, compared to $131.5 million, or 156% of net income, for the first six months of 2016.

Mr. Engel continued, "We remain focused on executing our strategies to deliver above-market sales growth, improve profitability, generate strong cash flow, and increase shareholder value. The free cash flow generation capability of our business supports continued investment in our differentiated, services-oriented business model and One WESCO growth initiatives, including acquisitions, while providing us with the ability to return capital to our shareholders. Our efforts remain centered on providing excellent customer service and delivering value to our customers' operations and supply chains by providing comprehensive product and service solutions that meet their capital project, MRO, and OEM needs."

PITTSBURGH, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE:   WCC), a leading provider of electrical, industrial, and communications MRO and OEM products, construction materials, and advanced supply chain management and logistics services, announces its results for the second quarter of 2017.








Mr. John J. Engel, WESCO's Chairman, President and CEO, commented, "Our second quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in April. Notably, we returned to organic sales growth in the quarter, after eight consecutive quarters of sales declines, driven by growth in our Industrial and CIG end markets as well as in our Canadian and International businesses. Our sales momentum accelerated as the quarter progressed, and this trend has continued into July, with all geographies growing to start the third quarter. Backlog grew sequentially in the quarter versus the typical seasonal decline, with June marking the highest monthly backlog since 2012. Operating margin was also in line with our expectations, as we continue to execute our cost management and supply chain initiatives to mitigate the effects of a still-challenging and demand-constrained pricing environment. Additionally, during the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of shares, while remaining within our targeted financial leverage band.
The first half has developed as we expected, and we are encouraged with the improving momentum of our business. Our technical capabilities and service offerings promote loyal customer relationships and growth. In the second half, as our expected growth accelerates, we plan to invest to strengthen our differentiated business model and improve our competitive advantage in 2018 and beyond. Based upon our first half results and our plan for the second half, we have narrowed our full-year expectations for sales to be up 1% to 3%, operating margin to be 4.1% to 4.3%, and EPS to be $3.60 to $3.90 per diluted share with an effective tax rate of approximately 27%. We continue to expect free cash flow generation for the year to be at least 90% of net income."
The following are results for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016:

Net sales were $1.91 billion for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016. Organic sales for the second quarter of 2017 grew by 1.0% as foreign exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 1.1%. Sequentially, net sales increased 7.7% and organic sales increased 8.0%. 
Cost of goods sold for the second quarter of 2017 was $1.54 billion and gross profit was $366.1 million, compared to cost of goods sold and gross profit of $1.53 billion and $379.5 million for the second quarter of 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 19.2% and 19.9% for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $267.3 million, or 14.0% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $274.5 million, or 14.4% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2016. 
Operating profit was $83.1 million for the current quarter, compared to $88.0 million for the second quarter of 2016. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 4.4% for the second quarter of 2017, compared to 4.6% for the second quarter of 2016. 
Interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 was $16.8 million, compared to $19.5 million for the second quarter of 2016. Non-cash interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, which includes amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing fees, and interest related to uncertain tax positions, was $1.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively. 
The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 25.3%, compared to 27.3% for the prior year second quarter. The lower effective tax rate in the current quarter as compared to the prior year's comparable quarter is primarily the result of favorable discrete items and the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 
Net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was $49.5 million and $49.8 million for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Earnings per diluted share was $1.02 for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, based on 48.8 million and 48.6 million diluted shares, respectively. 
Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2017 was $19.1 million, compared to $60.0 million for the second quarter of 2016. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2017 was $13.8 million, or 28% of net income, compared to $56.5 million, or 113% of net income, for the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, the Company completed $50 million of share repurchases in the second quarter.

The following are results for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016:

Net sales were $3.68 billion for the first six months of 2017, compared to $3.69 billion for the first six months of 2016, a decrease of 0.1%. Acquisitions had a positive impact on net sales of 0.4% and were partially offset by a 0.2% negative impact from foreign exchange rates, resulting in a 0.3% decrease in organic sales for the first six months of 2017. 
Cost of goods sold for the first six months of 2017 was $2.97 billion and gross profit was $716.1 million, compared to cost of goods sold and gross profit of $2.95 billion and $734.6 million for the first six months of 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 19.4% and 19.9% for the first six months of 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $534.3 million, or 14.5% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017, compared to $543.8 million, or 14.7% of net sales, for the first six months of 2016. 
Operating profit was $150.2 million for the first six months of 2017, compared to $157.5 million for the first six months of 2016. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 4.1% for the first six months of 2017, compared to 4.3% for the first six months of 2016. 
Interest expense for the first six months of 2017 was $33.5 million, compared to $38.3 million for the first six months of 2016. Non-cash interest expense for the first six months of 2017 and 2016, which includes amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing fees, and interest related to uncertain tax positions, was $2.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively. 
The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2017 was 25.1%, compared to 29.2% for the first six months of 2016. The current year's effective tax rate is lower than the prior year primarily due to favorable discrete items, including a benefit from the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards, as well as the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 
Net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was $87.3 million for the first six months of 2017, compared to $85.9 million for the first six months of 2016. 
Earnings per diluted share for the first six months of 2017 was $1.78, based on 49.1 million diluted shares, compared to $1.79 for the first six months of 2016, based on 47.8 million diluted shares. 
Operating cash flow for the first six months of 2017 was $66.8 million, compared to $138.6 million for the first six months of 2016. Free cash flow for the first six months of 2017 was $57.0 million, or 65% of net income, compared to $131.5 million, or 156% of net income, for the first six months of 2016.

Mr. Engel continued, "We remain focused on executing our strategies to deliver above-market sales growth, improve profitability, generate strong cash flow, and increase shareholder value. The free cash flow generation capability of our business supports continued investment in our differentiated, services-oriented business model and One WESCO growth initiatives, including acquisitions, while providing us with the ability to return capital to our shareholders. Our efforts remain centered on providing excellent customer service and delivering value to our customers' operations and supply chains by providing comprehensive product and service solutions that meet their capital project, MRO, and OEM needs."

History[edit]
In 1922, WESCO Distribution was formed as a subsidiary of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation also based in Pittsburgh. It had existed for decades within Westinghouse as the subsidiary charged with selling and distributing company components in the electrical and industrial fields. WESCO maintained close ties to its parent. In 1994, the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) arranged for the purchase of WESCO from Westinghouse.
CD & R sold WESCO to The Cypress Group for $1.1 billion in June 1998. This group formed WESCO International, Inc., which is the current owner of WESCO Distribution.[3]
On May 12, 1999, WESCO held its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, selling 9.72 million shares for $18 per share, raising $175 million.
In 2008, the company was recognized for "environmentally sustainable business practices" through an Environmental Stewardship Award from Veolia ES Technical Solutions.[4][notes 1]
In November 2010 the company acquired TVC Communications, a "distributor of broadband communications network infrastructure" for about US$250,000,000.[5]
In June, 2012 the company acquired Conney Safety for an undisclosed sum.[6][7]

PITTSBURGH, April 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE:   WCC), a leading provider of electrical, industrial, and communications MRO and OEM products, construction materials, and advanced supply chain management and logistics services, announces its results for the first quarter of 2017.








Mr. John J. Engel, WESCO's Chairman, President and CEO, commented, "Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and the outlook we provided in January. Our sales results reflect improving momentum in our business, driven by a return to growth in Industrial and in Canada. Operating margin was also in line with our expectations, as we continue to execute our cost management and supply chain initiatives in a still-challenging and demand-constrained pricing environment. Net income grew in the quarter, and we once again delivered strong free cash flow, enabling us to reduce our debt and further improve our financial leverage ratio. Based upon our first quarter results, we reaffirm our full-year expectations of sales in the range of flat to up 4%, EPS of $3.60 to $4.00 per diluted share, and free cash flow generation of at least 90% of net income."
The following are results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016:

Net sales were $1.77 billion for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.78 billion for the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 0.2%. Acquisitions and foreign exchange rates had positive impacts on net sales of 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively, resulting in a 1.7% decrease in organic sales. 


Cost of goods sold for both the first quarter of 2017 and 2016 was $1.42 billion. Gross profit was $350.0 million and $355.2 million for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 19.7% and 20.0% for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. 


Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $266.9 million, or 15.1% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $269.3 million, or 15.2% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2016. 


Operating profit was $67.1 million for the current quarter, compared to $69.5 million for the first quarter of 2016. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 3.8% for the first quarter of 2017, compared to 3.9% for the first quarter of 2016. 


Interest expense for the first quarter of 2017 was $16.7 million, compared to $18.8 million for the first quarter of 2016. Non-cash interest expense for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, which includes amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing fees, and interest related to uncertain tax positions, was $1.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively.


The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 25.0%, compared to 31.9% for the prior year first quarter. In the current quarter, the application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 resulted in a discrete benefit from the exercise of stock-based awards, which lowered the effective tax rate by 3.1 percentage points. In the first quarter of 2016, the settlement of an outstanding tax matter increased the effective tax rate by 3.4 percentage points.


Net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was $37.7 million and $36.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. 


Earnings per diluted share was $0.76 for the first quarter of 2017, based on 49.4 million diluted shares, compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.77 for the first quarter of 2016, based on 46.8 million diluted shares. 


Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 was $47.6 million, compared to $78.6 million for the first quarter of 2016. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 was $43.1 million, or 114% of net income, compared to $75.0 million, or 217% of net income for the first quarter of 2016.

Mr. Engel continued, "We remain focused on executing our strategies to deliver above-market sales growth, improve profitability, generate strong cash flow, and increase shareholder value. The free cash flow generation capability of our business supports continued investment in our One WESCO growth initiatives, including acquisitions, while providing us with the ability to return capital to our shareholders. Our efforts remain centered on providing excellent customer service and delivering value to our customers' operations and supply chains by providing comprehensive product and service solutions, which meet their capital project, MRO, and OEM needs."

PITTSBURGH, Jan. 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE: WCC), a leading provider of electrical, industrial, and communications MRO and OEM products, construction materials, and advanced supply chain management and logistics services, announces its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016.



Mr. John J. Engel, WESCO's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations, and results for the full year were within the outlook range provided in December 2015. Normalized organic sales declined versus prior year but grew sequentially, reflecting improving momentum in our business, and our first Q4 sequential sales growth in five years. Operating margin was also in line with our expectations, as we took additional actions to reduce our costs and improve productivity. Free cash flow generation remained strong, enabling us to reduce our debt and get back within our target financial leverage range."
The following are results for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015:

Net sales were $1.79 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $1.86 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of 3.7%. Acquisitions had a 1.8% positive impact on net sales and were offset by a 1.6% impact from number of workdays and a 0.3% impact from foreign exchange rates, resulting in a 3.6% decrease in normalized organic sales. Sequentially, net sales decreased 3.3% and normalized organic sales increased 0.3%. 

Cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $1.44 billion and gross profit was $348.6 million, compared to cost of goods sold and gross profit of $1.50 billion and $363.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 19.4% and 19.5% for the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $249.9 million, or 13.9% of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $256.9 million, or 13.8% of net sales, for the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Operating profit was $82.1 million for the current quarter, compared to $90.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 4.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to 4.8% for the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $17.5 million, compared to $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Non-cash interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015, which includes amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing fees, and interest related to uncertain tax positions, was expense of $1.7 million and income of $6.5 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the resolution of transfer pricing matters associated with previously filed tax positions resulted in non-cash interest income. 

The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 26.0%, compared to 39.3% for the prior year fourth quarter. The resolution of the transfer pricing matter described above increased the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was $47.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to net income of $48.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Earnings per diluted share was $0.96 for the fourth quarter of 2016, based on 49.2 million diluted shares, compared to earnings per diluted share of $1.03 for the fourth quarter of 2015, based on 47.2 million diluted shares. 

Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $83.0 million, compared to $107.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $78.2 million, or 164% of net income, compared to $101.6 million, or 209% of net income for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
The following are results for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015:

Net sales were $7.34 billion for 2016, compared to $7.52 billion for 2015, a decrease of 2.4%. Acquisitions and number of workdays had positive impacts on net sales of 3.1% and 0.4%, respectively, and were partially offset by a 1.0% impact from foreign exchange rates, resulting in a 4.9% decrease in normalized organic sales.

Cost of goods sold for 2016 was $5.89 billion and gross profit was $1.45 billion, compared to cost of goods sold and gross profit of $6.02 billion and $1.49 billion for 2015, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 19.7% and 19.9% for 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $1.0 billion, or 14.3% of net sales for 2016, compared to $1.1 billion, or 14.0% of net sales, for 2015. 

Operating profit was $332.0 million for 2016, compared to $373.7 million for 2015. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 4.5% for 2016, compared to 5.0% for 2015. 

Interest expense for 2016 was $76.6 million, compared to $69.8 million for 2015. Non-cash interest expense for 2016 and 2015, which includes amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing fees, and interest related to uncertain tax positions, was $7.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively. In 2015, the resolution of transfer pricing matters associated with previously filed tax positions resulted in non-cash interest income.

Loss on debt redemption of $123.9 million for 2016 was the result of a non-cash charge from the early redemption of the Company's 6.0% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2029 in the third quarter of 2016.

The effective tax rate for 2016 was 23.1%, compared to 31.4% for 2015. The effective tax rate for the current year was positively impacted by the loss on debt redemption, whereas the resolution of the transfer pricing matter described above resulted in incremental income tax expense in 2015.

Earnings per diluted share for 2016 was $2.10 per share, based on 48.3 million diluted shares, compared to $4.18 per share for 2015, based on 50.4 million diluted shares. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2016 was $3.80.

Operating cash flow for 2016 was $300.2 million, compared to $283.1 million for 2015. Free cash flow for 2016 of $282.2 million, or 154% of adjusted net income, compared to $261.4 million, or 125% of net income for 2015. 
Mr. Engel continued, "On a full year basis, our 2016 results reflect the challenging economic and end market environment, as well as the impact of political uncertainty on spending in the industries we serve. We responded to these challenges by reducing our costs and streamlining our organization while ensuring continued strong free cash flow generation. These actions partially mitigated the impact of lower sales and business mix on earnings per share. We remain focused on executing our One WESCO strategy, and as a result of our organizational changes and continued execution of our business initiatives, we are entering 2017 with a stronger team focused on driving increased profitability as our end markets return to growth. The free cash flow generation capability of our business supports continued investment in our One WESCO growth initiatives, including acquisitions, along with our other cash allocation priorities. We reaffirm our expectation of 2017 sales in the range of flat to up 4%, EPS of $3.60 to $4.00 per diluted share, and free cash flow generation of at least 90% of net income, as we outlined in our investor outlook call in December."
Mr. Engel added, "After two years of industry sales declines and talk of an industrial recession, we are pleased to hear increased optimism from customers and see the beginning signs of a recovery. In this period of change and uncertainty, customers and suppliers need strong and reliable supply chain partners. WESCO provides leading supply chain solutions supported by our broad portfolio of products and value-added services. Our efforts are centered on providing outstanding customer service and delivering value to our customers' operations and supply chains. I am very proud of the extra effort demonstrated by all WESCO associates in serving our customers last year, and I am confident in our team's ability to improve our performance in 2017."

(1)    The Company early adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17 , Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, on a prospective basis during the first quarter of 2016. This guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.





(2)    The Company adopted ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation  of Debt Issuance Costs, and ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, on a retrospective basis during the first quarter of 2016. These ASUs simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. As a result of adopting this guidance, the Company reclassified approximately $17.7 million of deferred financing fees from other noncurrent assets to long-term debt in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
This earnings release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include normalized organic sales change, gross profit, financial leverage, free cash flow, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in order to provide a better understanding of the Company's organic sales trends, capital structure position and liquidity on a comparable basis. Additionally, certain of the aforementioned non-GAAP measures either focus on or exclude transactions impacting comparability of results, allowing investors to more easily compare the Company's financial performance from period to period. Management does not use these non-GAAP financial measures for any purpose other than the reasons stated above.

Reports Second Quarter 2017 ResultsPR NewswireJuly 27, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareSecond quarter highlights:- Consolidated net sales of $1.91 billion- Operating profit of $83.1 million- Earnings per diluted share of $1.02- Repurchased $50 million of sharesPITTSBURGH, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WESCO International, Inc. (WCC), a leading provider of electrical, industrial, and communications MRO and OEM products, construction materials, and advanced supply chain management and logistics services, announces its results for the second quarter of 2017.WESCO International, Inc. LogoMoreMr. John J. Engel, WESCO's Chairman, President and CEO, commented, "Our second quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in April. Notably, we returned to organic sales growth in the quarter, after eight consecutive quarters of sales declines, driven by growth in our Industrial and CIG end markets as well as in our Canadian and International businesses. Our sales momentum accelerated as the quarter progressed, and this trend has continued into July, with all geographies growing to start the third quarter. Backlog grew sequentially in the quarter versus the typical seasonal decline, with June marking the highest monthly backlog since 2012. Operating margin was also in line with our expectations, as we continue to execute our cost management and supply chain initiatives to mitigate the effects of a still-challenging and demand-constrained pricing environment. Additionally, during the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of shares, while remaining within our targeted financial leverage band.The first half has developed as we expected, and we are encouraged with the improving momentum of our business. Our technical capabilities and service offerings promote loyal customer relationships and growth. In the second half, as our expected growth accelerates, we plan to invest to strengthen our differentiated business model and improve our competitive advantage in 2018 and beyond. Based upon our first half results and our plan for the second half, we have narrowed our full-year expectations for sales to be up 1% to 3%, operating margin to be 4.1% to 4.3%, and EPS to be $3.60 to $3.90 per diluted share with an effective tax rate of approximately 27%. We continue to expect free cash flow generation for the year to be at least 90% of net income."The following are results for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016:Net sales were $1.91 billion for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016. Organic sales for the second quarter of 2017 grew by 1.0% as foreign exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 1.1%. Sequentially, net sales increased 7.7% and organic sales increased 8.0%. Cost of goods sold for the second quarter of 2017 was $1.54 billion and gross profit was $366.1 million, compared to cost of goods sold and gross profit of $1.53 billion and $379.5 million for the second quarter of 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 19.2% and 19.9% for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $267.3 million, or 14.0% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $274.5 million, or 14.4% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2016. Operating profit was $83.1 million for the current quarter, compared to $88.0 million for the second quarter of 2016. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 4.4% for the second quarter of 2017, compared to 4.6% for the second quarter of 2016. Interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 was $16.8 million, compared to $19.5 million for the second quarter of 2016. Non-cash interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, which includes amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing fees, and interest related to uncertain tax positions, was $1.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 25.3%, compared to 27.3% for the prior year second quarter. The lower effective tax rate in the current quarter as compared to the prior year's comparable quarter is primarily the result of favorable discrete items and the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was $49.5 million and $49.8 million for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Earnings per diluted share was $1.02 for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, based on 48.8 million and 48.6 million diluted shares, respectively. Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2017 was $19.1 million, compared to $60.0 million for the second quarter of 2016. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2017 was $13.8 million, or 28% of net income, compared to $56.5 million, or 113% of net income, for the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, the Company completed $50 million of share repurchases in the second quarter.The following are results for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016:Net sales were $3.68 billion for the first six months of 2017, compared to $3.69 billion for the first six months of 2016, a decrease of 0.1%. Acquisitions had a positive impact on net sales of 0.4% and were partially offset by a 0.2% negative impact from foreign exchange rates, resulting in a 0.3% decrease in organic sales for the first six months of 2017. Cost of goods sold for the first six months of 2017 was $2.97 billion and gross profit was $716.1 million, compared to cost of goods sold and gross profit of $2.95 billion and $734.6 million for the first six months of 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 19.4% and 19.9% for the first six months of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $534.3 million, or 14.5% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017, compared to $543.8 million, or 14.7% of net sales, for the first six months of 2016. Operating profit was $150.2 million for the first six months of 2017, compared to $157.5 million for the first six months of 2016. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 4.1% for the first six months of 2017, compared to 4.3% for the first six months of 2016. Interest expense for the first six months of 2017 was $33.5 million, compared to $38.3 million for the first six months of 2016. Non-cash interest expense for the first six months of 2017 and 2016, which includes amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing fees, and interest related to uncertain tax positions, was $2.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2017 was 25.1%, compared to 29.2% for the first six months of 2016. The current year's effective tax rate is lower than the prior year primarily due to favorable discrete items, including a benefit from the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards, as well as the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was $87.3 million for the first six months of 2017, compared to $85.9 million for the first six months of 2016. Earnings per diluted share for the first six months of 2017 was $1.78, based on 49.1 million diluted shares, compared to $1.79 for the first six months of 2016, based on 47.8 million diluted shares. Operating cash flow for the first six months of 2017 was $66.8 million, compared to $138.6 million for the first six months of 2016. Free cash flow for the first six months of 2017 was $57.0 million, or 65% of net income, compared to $131.5 million, or 156% of net income, for the first six months of 2016.Mr. Engel continued, "We remain focused on executing our strategies to deliver above-market sales growth, improve profitability, generate strong cash flow, and increase shareholder value. The free cash flow generation capability of our business supports continued investment in our differentiated, services-oriented business model and One WESCO growth initiatives, including acquisitions, while providing us with the ability to return capital to our shareholders. Our efforts remain centered on providing excellent customer service and delivering value to our customers' operations and supply chains by providing comprehensive product and service solutions that meet their capital project, MRO, and OEM needs."Read MoreWebcast and Teleconference AccessWESCO will conduct a webcast and teleconference to discuss the second quarter earnings as described in this News Release on Thursday, July 27, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. E.T.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

WESCO International, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results - Jul 27, 2017




































News Releases 










WESCO International, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results
Second quarter highlights:- Consolidated net sales of $1.91 billion- Operating profit of $83.1 million- Earnings per diluted share of $1.02- Repurchased $50 million of shares


PITTSBURGH, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE: WCC), a leading provider of electrical, industrial, and communications MRO and OEM products, construction materials, and advanced supply chain management and logistics services, announces its results for the second quarter of 2017.



Mr. John J. Engel, WESCO's Chairman, President and CEO, commented, "Our second quarter results were in line with the outlook we provided in April. Notably, we returned to organic sales growth in the quarter, after eight consecutive quarters of sales declines, driven by growth in our Industrial and CIG end markets as well as in our Canadian and International businesses. Our sales momentum accelerated as the quarter progressed, and this trend has continued into July, with all geographies growing to start the third quarter. Backlog grew sequentially in the quarter versus the typical seasonal decline, with June marking the highest monthly backlog since 2012. Operating margin was also in line with our expectations, as we continue to execute our cost management and supply chain initiatives to mitigate the effects of a still-challenging and demand-constrained pricing environment. Additionally, during the quarter, we repurchased $50 million of shares, while remaining within our targeted financial leverage band.
The first half has developed as we expected, and we are encouraged with the improving momentum of our business. Our technical capabilities and service offerings promote loyal customer relationships and growth. In the second half, as our expected growth accelerates, we plan to invest to strengthen our differentiated business model and improve our competitive advantage in 2018 and beyond. Based upon our first half results and our plan for the second half, we have narrowed our full-year expectations for sales to be up 1% to 3%, operating margin to be 4.1% to 4.3%, and EPS to be $3.60 to $3.90 per diluted share with an effective tax rate of approximately 27%. We continue to expect free cash flow generation for the year to be at least 90% of net income."
The following are results for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016:

Net sales were $1.91 billion for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016. Organic sales for the second quarter of 2017 grew by 1.0% as foreign exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 1.1%. Sequentially, net sales increased 7.7% and organic sales increased 8.0%.
Cost of goods sold for the second quarter of 2017 was $1.54 billion and gross profit was $366.1 million, compared to cost of goods sold and gross profit of $1.53 billion and $379.5 million for the second quarter of 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 19.2% and 19.9% for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $267.3 million, or 14.0% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $274.5 million, or 14.4% of net sales, for the second quarter of 2016.
Operating profit was $83.1 million for the current quarter, compared to $88.0 million for the second quarter of 2016. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 4.4% for the second quarter of 2017, compared to 4.6% for the second quarter of 2016.
Interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 was $16.8 million, compared to $19.5 million for the second quarter of 2016. Non-cash interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, which includes amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing fees, and interest related to uncertain tax positions, was $1.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 25.3%, compared to 27.3% for the prior year second quarter. The lower effective tax rate in the current quarter as compared to the prior year's comparable quarter is primarily the result of favorable discrete items and the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.
Net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was $49.5 million and $49.8 million for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Earnings per diluted share was $1.02 for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, based on 48.8 million and 48.6 million diluted shares, respectively.
Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2017 was $19.1 million, compared to $60.0 million for the second quarter of 2016. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2017 was $13.8 million, or 28% of net income, compared to $56.5 million, or 113% of net income, for the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, the Company completed $50 million of share repurchases in the second quarter.
The following are results for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016:

Net sales were $3.68 billion for the first six months of 2017, compared to $3.69 billion for the first six months of 2016, a decrease of 0.1%. Acquisitions had a positive impact on net sales of 0.4% and were partially offset by a 0.2% negative impact from foreign exchange rates, resulting in a 0.3% decrease in organic sales for the first six months of 2017.
Cost of goods sold for the first six months of 2017 was $2.97 billion and gross profit was $716.1 million, compared to cost of goods sold and gross profit of $2.95 billion and $734.6 million for the first six months of 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was 19.4% and 19.9% for the first six months of 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $534.3 million, or 14.5% of net sales, for the first six months of 2017, compared to $543.8 million, or 14.7% of net sales, for the first six months of 2016.
Operating profit was $150.2 million for the first six months of 2017, compared to $157.5 million for the first six months of 2016. Operating profit as a percentage of net sales was 4.1% for the first six months of 2017, compared to 4.3% for the first six months of 2016.
Interest expense for the first six months of 2017 was $33.5 million, compared to $38.3 million for the first six months of 2016. Non-cash interest expense for the first six months of 2017 and 2016, which includes amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing fees, and interest related to uncertain tax positions, was $2.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the first six months of 2017 was 25.1%, compared to 29.2% for the first six months of 2016. The current year's effective tax rate is lower than the prior year primarily due to favorable discrete items, including a benefit from the exercise and vesting of stock-based awards, as well as the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.
Net income attributable to WESCO International, Inc. was $87.3 million for the first six months of 2017, compared to $85.9 million for the first six months of 2016.
Earnings per diluted share for the first six months of 2017 was $1.78, based on 49.1 million diluted shares, compared to $1.79 for the first six months of 2016, based on 47.8 million diluted shares.
Operating cash flow for the first six months of 2017 was $66.8 million, compared to $138.6 million for the first six months of 2016. Free cash flow for the first six months of 2017 was $57.0 million, or 65% of net income, compared to $131.5 million, or 156% of net income, for the first six months of 2016.
