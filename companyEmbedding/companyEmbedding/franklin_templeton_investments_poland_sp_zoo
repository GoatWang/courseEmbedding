Franklin Templeton IndiaFranklin Templeton's association with India dates back to over 2 decades as an investor. As part of the group's major thrust on investing in markets around the world, the India office was set up in 1996 as Templeton Asset Management India Pvt. Limited. It flagged off the mutual fund business with the launch of Templeton India Growth Fund in September 1996, and since then the business has grown at a steady pace.Trusted Partner in Asset ManagementOur Core Values
At Franklin Templeton, we understand that the strength of our business relationships is a key point of differentiation for us as a company, along with the trust that our business partners and clients have in us. Throughout the company’s history, a strong commitment to corporate values has guided our decision making and has been a roadmap for our success.  These values, and our unique perspective, help us achieve our mission by offering high quality investment solutions, providing outstanding service, and attracting, motivating and retaining talented people.

Key Points from the Topic Paper
This paper, "Global Growth: Headwinds or Tailwinds?," aims to provide an objective analysis of the main trends shaping the global economy in 2015.
Global Economic Pessimism Unwarranted
Excessive pessimism characterizes the current view on the global growth outlook, with some of this sentiment due to a mistaken interpretation of the reasons behind the recent sharp decline in oil prices. We see the decline in oil prices as being largely due to a positive supply shock, rather than a weakening of oil demand. A positive supply shock that drives down the price of oil provides a significant boost to global growth, though we think there will also be winners and losers.
US Economy Keeps Rolling
The US economy benefits significantly from lower oil prices and is currently in a kind of "goldilocks" scenario: The recovery has firmed while receiving a boost from lower oil prices; those lower oil prices are helping keep inflationary pressures muted, thus allowing the Federal Reserve to maintain very low interest rates. However, base effects on energy prices will be much less favorable down the road and, combined with a tighter labor market and faster economic growth, could result in a meaningful acceleration in inflation pressures. At that point we might see a sudden upward adjustment in bond yields. This growth and inflation outlook also implies that current US dollar strength still has longer to run.
Europe Benefitting From Tailwinds
The eurozone economy relies to a very important extent on exports and should benefit from several strong tailwinds largely being ignored by the financial markets. First, robust growth in the US, particularly in terms of consumer demand, should provide solid support for eurozone exports to the US. Second, the European Central Bank's effectively open-ended stimulus program will put further downward pressure on the euro, also boosting exports. Third, the decline in oil prices will support growth, adding to the potential for European growth to surprise to the upside this year.
Abenomics Positive, But Not Final
Japan appears to have exited the cycle of deflation and contraction in nominal growth since the launch of "Abenomics." However, Japan now needs decisive action to raise its potential growth path, consolidate the positive inflation dynamics and improve revenue collection. All three conditions are needed to secure stronger growth and debt sustainability. Progress in 2015 will be the key test.
China Rebalancing
China, as the world's largest importer of oil, will also be an important beneficiary of lower energy prices, which would help mitigate the country's mild and healthy slowdown. However, some observers have argued the China's growth rate is actually much lower than indicated by official statistics. We believe this argument simply does not stand up to scrutiny, and we think the rebalancing of China's economy might be further along than is commonly believed. Overall, we see the dynamics at play as meaning that the country can support a gradual rebalancing at a more moderate, sustainable pace of growth that can still contribute strongly to global growth.
Oil Impact on Emerging Markets Differentiated
Markets perceive the sharp reduction in oil prices as a net negative for all emerging markets, rather than a major source of differentiation. The emerging-markets world includes some of the world's largest oil producers but also some of its largest oil consumers. We believe the oil price decline is likely to further accentuate the differentiation between the world's strong and poor performers, particularly among emerging markets.
Our view is that the overall outlook is sufficiently supportive to allow countries with sound policies to thrive. We will likely see great differentiation in cross-country performances, making fundamentals-based investment strategies critical.

Franklin Templeton Investments Poland Sp. z o.o. praca

















































 


Who We AreFranklin Resources, Inc. is a global investment management organization known as Franklin Templeton Investments. Our headquarters are located just south of San Francisco, in San Mateo, California. We have offices in over 30 countries around the world, offering investment solutions and services in more than 150 countries and maintain over 200,000 advisor relationships.
What We Do
We offer investment products primarily under the Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series brand names and manage investment vehicles for individuals, institutions, pension plans, trusts, partnerships and other clients.
We take a long-term, strategic approach to investing that has helped us thrive through the many ups and downs of market cycles over the past 65 years. Franklin Templeton has sought out opportunities by adhering to these principles: Don’t follow the crowd. Buy when markets are down. Hunt for value and bargains. Search worldwide. And evaluate each investment based on strict criteria. These principles have helped us build an enviable record of performance, achieve the goals of millions of investors and made Franklin Templeton one of the largest, most respected mutual fund companies in the world.
Fiscal responsibility is embedded in all aspects of our business. At Franklin Resources, Inc. (operating as Franklin Templeton Investments), our solid financial track record includes conservative balance sheet management practices, substantial liquid cash and investments and access to additional liquidity. Furthermore, our credit ratings are among the highest of any asset management company.
In much the same way that portfolio diversification reduces risk, our asset base, diversified by investment objective and sales region, has served as a key strength, particularly during challenging market conditions. In fact, coming out of the recent global recession—the worst economic crisis since the creation of mutual funds—we emerged stronger than ever.
 
Think Global, Act Local
As the global economy has become increasingly more complex and interconnected, the nature of global investing continues to change. True global diversification requires more than analyzing international markets from afar; it requires firsthand knowledge and an understanding of local market nuances. 
Our global perspective is built on decades of first-hand experience navigating the world’s local markets. A pioneer in global investing, we have developed an extensive network of research offices, trading platforms and investment professionals working in offices around the world.
