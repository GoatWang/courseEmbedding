 Educational Background



JD, cum laude 
Class of 1979 


University of Notre Dame - The Law School

                  In the practice of law, the same ethical standards must be met whether you are a graduate of Notre Dame or any other university. So, what is it that makes our graduates unique? We believe it can be found in our ultimate goal. Beyond striving for professional achievement, a Notre Dame lawyer fundamentally acts in service to others. Our approach seeks to do more than train students in a profession; it seeks to help them discover their lives as a vocation. A different kind of lawyer is one who realizes the practice of law is not an end in itself. It’s the beginning of a new, highly specialized way of giving back.                




BA, magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa 
Class of 1976 


Hofstra University

                  Hofstra University is a private, nonsectarian institution of higher learning located in the Village of Hempstead, New York, United States, about 7 miles (11 km) east of New York City. It originated in 1935 as an extension of New York University (NYU) called "Nassau College – Hofstra Memorial of New York University at Hempstead, Long Island";[4] in 1937, the institution separated from NYU and gained independence as Hofstra College,[5] and in 1963, Hofstra College gained university status. Comprising ten schools, including a School of Medicine and a School of Law, Hofstra is noted for a series of prominent Presidential conferences, as well as being selected to host a United States Presidential Debate in 2008 and 2012. The university organizes a wide range of other international academic conferences (many under the aegis of the Hofstra Cultural Center), holds an annual Shakespeare festival in its own replica of the Globe Theatre, and has both an arboretum and bird sanctuary.
