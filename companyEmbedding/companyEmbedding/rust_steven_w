Serious Customer Service Problems
“Their customer service is the absolute worst. I did a trial membership and cancelled it long ago and then out of the blue I get an email message saying I'm going to be charged a membership fee. I immediately sent a message saying no thanks but they charged my card anyway. They have serious problems with customer service.”
