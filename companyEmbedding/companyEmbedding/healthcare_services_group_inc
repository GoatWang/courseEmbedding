Overall a decent place to work.ConsThe cons of the job are dealing with sometimes disgruntled employees. There needs to be a more openness towards the pattern of growth for even front line staff. If we could promise them pay raises at 6 months, 1 year, 2 year etc I think that employee retention rates would sky rocket. It would give more moral to staff as well.Advice to ManagementCome up with some new ideas for contract negotiations so that we could be more competitive with pay as other cleaning companies.

GlobeNewswire



Jul 11, 2017 4:15 PM EDT













 




























































 BENSALEM, Pa., July 11, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Healthcare Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HCSG) reported that revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 increased approximately 22% to $470.9 million. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $22.6 million, or $0.31 per basic and $0.30 per diluted common share, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 net income of $18.8 million, or $0.26 per basic and diluted common share. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased approximately 13% to $875.4 million. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $44.6 million, or $0.61 per basic and $0.60 per diluted common share, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016 net income of $37.4 million, or $0.52 per basic and $0.51 per diluted common share. In addition, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18875 per common share, payable on September 22, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 18, 2017. This represents the 57th consecutive quarterly cash dividend payment, as well as the 56th consecutive increase since our initiation of quarterly cash dividend payments in 2003. The Company will host a conference call on Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The call may be accessed via phone at 800-893-5360. The call will be simultaneously webcast under the "Events & Presentations" section of the investor relations page on our website, www.hcsg.com. A replay of the earnings call may be accessed through the phone number above through approximately 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, July 12, 2017. The webcast will also be available on our website for one year following the date of the earnings call.  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This release and any schedules incorporated by reference into it may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), as amended, which are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and industry, and our beliefs and assumptions. Words such as "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," " will," "goal," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The inclusion of forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that any of our plans will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Such forward-looking information is also subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, risks arising from our providing services exclusively to the health care industry, primarily providers of long-term care; having one client which accounted for 12.9% of our total consolidated revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017; credit and collection risks associated with this industry; our claims experience related to workers' compensation and general liability insurance; the effects of changes in, or interpretations of laws and regulations governing the industry, our workforce and services provided, including state and local regulations pertaining to the taxability of our services and other labor related matters such as minimum wage increases; tax benefits arising from our corporate reorganization and self-funded health insurance program transition; risks associated with the reorganization of our corporate structure; perceived or real risks related to the food industry; and the risk factors described in our Form 10-K  filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2016 in Part I thereof under "Government Regulation of Clients," "Competition'' and "Service Agreements/Collections," and under Item IA "Risk Factors."   These factors, in addition to delays in payments from clients, have resulted in, and could continue to result in, significant additional bad debts in the near future. Additionally, our operating results would be adversely affected if unexpected increases in the costs of labor and labor-related costs, materials, supplies and equipment used in performing services could not be passed on to our clients.  In addition, we believe that to improve our financial performance we must continue to obtain service agreements with new clients, retain and provide new services to existing clients, achieve modest price increases on current service agreements with existing clients and maintain internal cost reduction strategies at our various operational levels. Furthermore, we believe that our ability to sustain the internal development of managerial personnel is an important factor impacting future operating results and the successful execution of our projected growth strategies.  Healthcare Services Group, Inc. is the largest national provider of professional housekeeping, laundry and dietary services to long-term care and related health care facilities.

Come Grow With Us
Company Growth
Since its inception, Healthcare Services Group has doubled in size nearly every 5 years. That growth has resulted in the doubling of our middle and upper management positions in that same time period. Taking into account the “graying of America,” we see that trend continuing, creating growth potential for our management personnel unlike any other industry.

Career Opportunities
The ability to attract and develop individuals with a strong entrepreneurial spirit has enabled us to dominate an industry traditionally not known for its professional management structure. A structured 90-day training program prepares our managers for an entry level role as an account manager. This position is the door that opens to all middle and upper management positions in operations, training and sales.
Opportunities For Growth
Healthcare Services Group believes in life-long learning and performance-based promotions. We also firmly believe in promoting from within our organization and that there is no substitute for learning the business “from the ground up”. We reward those individuals, who have dedicated the time to learn our culture and business practices, with truly unlimited career-growth opportunities.

Come Grow With Us
Company Growth
Since its inception, Healthcare Services Group has doubled in size nearly every 5 years. That growth has resulted in the doubling of our middle and upper management positions in that same time period. Taking into account the “graying of America,” we see that trend continuing, creating growth potential for our management personnel unlike any other industry.

Career Opportunities
The ability to attract and develop individuals with a strong entrepreneurial spirit has enabled us to dominate an industry traditionally not known for its professional management structure. A structured 90-day training program prepares our managers for an entry level role as an account manager. This position is the door that opens to all middle and upper management positions in operations, training and sales.
Opportunities For Growth
Healthcare Services Group believes in life-long learning and performance-based promotions. We also firmly believe in promoting from within our organization and that there is no substitute for learning the business “from the ground up”. We reward those individuals, who have dedicated the time to learn our culture and business practices, with truly unlimited career-growth opportunities.
