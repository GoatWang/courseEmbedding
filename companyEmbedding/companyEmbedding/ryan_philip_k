Phil Ryan was born just a few blocks from the White House in Washington D.C. while his father served in the armed services. Phil worked his way through law school attending classes at night while working during the day yet still managed to graduate number four in his class.
As an attorney, Phil has represented the State of Oklahoma liquidating insolvent insurance companies on behalf of the Oklahoma Insurance Department, participated in jury trials in both the federal and state court systems, and represented thousands of injured workers in trials before the Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Court. Phil presently concentrates his practice on Social Security disability cases, and has appeared at over two thousand hearings before federal judges assigned to the Social Security Administration in Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas.
In 1997, Phil served on the Lieutenant Governor’s Commission on Workers’ Compensation Reform. In 2010, Phil was appointed by Governor Brad Henry to serve as his representative on the Task Force on Vocational Rehabilitation for Injured Workers. Phil is an active member of Lawyers for Working Oklahomans (an organization made up of the most prominent attorneys representing injured Oklahoma workers). From 2005 through 2009 Phil served on LWO's board of directors and in 2010 he was elected President of this important organization. He is also a sustaining member of the National Organization of Social Security Claimant Representatives.
Phil serves on the Board of Directors of The Twelve Foundation, an organization dedicated to promoting youth recovery. He also serves on the Phi Delta Theta Alumni Advisory Board at Oklahoma State University. He has traveled to Northern Peru on three mission trips building homes and delivering food to the needy.
Phil loves spending time with his children and family. Phil is an avid cyclist and spends much of his spring and summer competing in regional road races and time trials.

 					15 August 2012, New York				
Swiss Re today announced the appointment of Philip K. Ryan as Chairman of the Swiss Re America Holding Corporation board, effective 1 October 2012. In this function, he succeeds Walter A. Bell, who has served as the holding company board's chairman since 2 September 2008.
Until May 2012, Ryan was Chief Financial Officer of Power Financial and Power Corporation of Canada, a diversified management and holding company with interests primarily in life insurance, asset management and financial advisory services.  Ryan has also held various leadership positions in his 22 years with Credit Suisse in the US, Switzerland and the UK; most notably, Chairman of the Financial Institutions Group and Chief Financial Officer of Credit Suisse Group.
"We're excited Philip has agreed to lead the holding company as chairman of its board," said Group Chairman Walter Kielholz. "Philip joins a high performing team that is focused on growing Swiss Re in the Americas, and maneuvering the business through a complex economic and regulatory environment."
"My familiarity with, and admiration for, Swiss Re goes back many years," said Philip Ryan, who has been a member of the Swiss Re America Holding Corp. board since 2010. "I look forward to lending my expertise to help the holding company expand its reputation in the Americas, and attract the talent and clients we need to sustain our growth."
In addition, Ryan will help Swiss Re focus on its strategic priorities in the Americas, while ensuring matters related to regulation, financial performance, and sustainability/resilience are supported.
Once Ryan officially becomes Chairman of Swiss Re America Holding Corporation in October, Walter Bell will remain on as a director, formally retiring from the holding company board by April 2013.
Bell has been integral in establishing Swiss Re's leadership in using insurance to help governments and NGOs adapt to the consequences of climate change while building financial resilience to the impact of natural catastrophes.  This includes forging partnerships between Swiss Re and USAID, as well as pioneering a parametric hurricane insurance cover for state governments.  
"We are extremely grateful for Walter's contributions to Swiss Re's continued leadership in America," said Kielholz. "Since joining as Chairman in 2008, Walter has guided the holding company through unprecedented change in the world markets. We deeply appreciate Walter's steadfastness and advocacy during that critical period."
