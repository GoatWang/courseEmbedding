What is OCC?
A World Class Clearing Organization
OCC, founded in 1973, is the world's largest equity derivatives clearing organization. OCC is dedicated to promoting stability and financial integrity in the marketplaces that it serves by focusing on sound risk management principles. By acting as guarantor, OCC ensures that the obligations of the contracts it clears are fulfilled.
As the marketplace evolves, so do the clearing capabilities at OCC. Although OCC began as a clearinghouse for listed equity options, it has grown into a globally recognized entity that clears a multitude of diverse and sophisticated products. OCC operates under the jurisdiction of both the SEC and the CFTC. As a registered clearing agency under SEC jurisdiction, OCC clears transactions for exchange-listed options, security futures and OTC options. As a registered derivatives clearing organization under CFTC jurisdiction, OCC offers clearing and settlement services for transactions in futures and options on futures.   OCC also provides central counterparty clearing and settlement services for securities lending transactions. In addition, OCC has been designated as a "systemically important" financial market utility under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act.
The management of OCC's business affairs is vested in its Board of Directors which includes diverse representation from exchanges, clearing members, public directors and management. OCC receives most of its revenue from clearing fees charged to its members. OCC offers volume discounts on fees and, as applicable, refunds excess fees to its clearing members.
The Exchanges and Markets We Serve
OCC's participant exchanges include: BATS Exchange, Inc., BOX Options Exchange LLC, C2 Options Exchange, Incorporated, Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated, EDGX Exchange, Inc., Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC, MIAX PEARL, LLC, Nasdaq GEMX, LLC, Nasdaq ISE, LLC, Nasdaq BX, Inc., Nasdaq MRX, LLC, Nasdaq  PHLX, LLC, Nasdaq Options Market, LLC, NYSE Amex Options, LLC, and NYSE Arca, Inc. OCC's clearing members serve both professional traders and public customers and comprise approximately 115 of the largest U.S. broker-dealers, futures commission merchants and non-U.S. securities firms. OCC's goal is to service clearing members and the exchanges through an operating plan that emphasizes timely, reliable and cost-efficient clearing operations.
OCC also serves other markets, including those trading commodity futures, commodity options, and security futures. OCC clears futures contracts traded on CBOE Futures Exchange, LLC, ELX Futures, LP, and Nasdaq Futures, Inc., as well as security futures contracts traded on OneChicago, LLC. In addition, OCC provides central counterparty services for two securities lending market structures, OCC's OTC Stock Loan Program and Automated Equity Finance Markets, Inc. (AQS), an automated marketplace for securities lending and borrowing.
