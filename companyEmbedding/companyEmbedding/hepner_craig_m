PrePaidLegal.com

















Ive been involved in the Home Based Business
        industry now for nine years, full time. 
        I love the concept of working from home, representing a real
        company with a great product, perfect timing, and incredible residual
        income.

Not
        knowing any better to begin with, I got involved with one start-up
        company after another  for a total of four  before our team
        leaders
        decided to take some appropriate time to find a long-term company with
        tremendous growth potential.  We couldn't afford to pour all our
        efforts into companies which were bound to fail, like most start-ups
        are. 
        
We
        saw Pre-Paid Legal's opportunity immediately, during the acquisition of
        TPN, in October of 1998.  We made the commitment as a team to work
        together and get to the top as soon as possible.  Because of the
        fabulous team I have the privilege of working with, I achieved the level
        of Executive Director my first 30 days, and Platinum within 24
        months.  After 26 months we now have dozens of Executive Directors,
        and we'll soon have dozens of ring earners as well!  We are absolutely overwhelmed
        with excitement and gratitude for what Pre-Paid Legal has given back to
        all of us -- our life.
When
        we started, my girlfriend, Tara Paustenbach, and I, along with our good
        friend Ben Kane, all had to share a two-bedroom apartment 
        -- and none of us had a car.  We
        were so broke.  It's amazing we were able to get caught up so
        quickly.  A year later, we moved into a four-bedroom home
        and purchased a brand new Ford
        Expedition (Ben got a 7 series BMW) . . . not to mention getting caught up
        on all sorts of bills!  My
        three sons, Joshua, Jeremy, and Julian, have
        witnessed how Pre-Paid Legal has changed our lives for the better --
        and I look forward to traveling this country with all of them, helping
        as many people as possible with this product and opportunity, while
        building a permanent, financial wall around my family.
My
        parents, Terry and Maxine Hepner, are my sponsors in PPL, and Ive been able to watch them
        achieve tremendous success as well.  Its a wonderful feeling to know youre helping to put
        your parents into a very strong retirement! 
        In the first 20 days of 2000, my
        parents earned more in overrides from their PPL business than what
        social security paid them all year long!

Our
        philosophy for success is to first surround yourself with
        successful people in this business, then do what they do. 
        PPL is the perfect business for someone who has no
        experience because new people can simply copy what the top earners
        are doing to achieve the same results.  Second, utilize the tools (Get Paid Daily CD, our PPL
        personal websites, videos, conference calls) to
        explain PPL.  The
        simpler you keep it, the more people can see themselves doing it, and
        duplicate it. 
        Third, attend all events. 
        Theres nothing like the feeling you have as you leave an
        International Convention, charged up and ready to recruit the world!




For
        us, PPL has truly changed our lives. 
        The future looks extremely bright, and were all dreaming about
        a fantastic life again.  Our
        attitude is great, and when that happens, everything else seems to
        fall into place!

CRAIG HEPNER
Home Based Business
NEWPORT COAST, CA
























For approximately the last 25 years, I've made my career in the home-based business industry; however, not until I joined LegalShield in October 1998, did I find the personal rewards and financial success I was seeking. After enduring the failure of five different start-up companies, it was very exciting to align myself with a long-term company poised for all out massive momentum. With LegalShield soon becoming a household name, there will be no limits to our ability to deliver affordable legal services while achieving personal and financial goals. 
At the time that LegalShield was introduced to me, I found myself in a place in life I never, ever thought I would be. After those five start-up companies failed in their first couple of years, all of a sudden I found myself with no car, no credit cards, no checking or savings account, no driver's license, and no place to call my own. I was approximately $200,000 in debt. With LegalShield, however, I managed to pull myself out of the hole. 
When I joined LegalShield, with the help of my parents and sponsors, Terry and Maxine Hepner, and the hard work of an incredible team, I achieved the Executive Director level in 30 days. In about a year, I earned my $100,000 ring. Now, I’ve also earned the $250,000, $300,000 and $400,000 rings. I was inducted into the Millionaire Club my fifth year in the business. 
With the phenomenal leadership and friendship of Sean and Loren Mikael, Kai Deering, Bill and Yadira Butkovich, Tara Paustenbach, Tony Agurs, Debra Otten, Michael Swanson, Lisa Melville, Annesah and Zarinah Nadir, Jerri Harris, Brandon and Terrie Beals, Julian Hepner, and Sanela Hadzihasanovich and their amazing teams, our organization has thousands of people earning great extra income from home, dozens of whom have earned the six-figure ring, and half dozen who are in the Millionaire Club. It's been exciting to see so many friends and family members get out of debt, send their children to quality schools, go on vacations and purchase cars and homes. Most importantly, we now have the time to do the things in life that are most meaningful and rewarding including spending quality time with family and friends. 
For so many of us, this business is truly a dream come true! The aspect of LegalShield that I value most is how it empowers all of us to give back more to our communities and take back our equal rights and justice. Throughout the 1980's and early 1990's, I was involved in several efforts aimed at securing universal human and civil rights and alleviating poverty in our own country and throughout the world. Because of the opportunity this company has given me, I am once again able to participate in these causes. Through the life examples of my inspirations, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X., John Lennon, Bob Marley, and Gandhi, we have the ability to offer social justice in the marketplace with our product while providing economic justice at home with our business opportunity! But there is even more that we can do. Working together, our goals can be much higher and accomplishments much greater. We can make a difference! As the acclaimed anthropologist Margaret Mead once said, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever does.”
