Background and training[edit]
He finished the MD–PhD program at Harvard University in six years.[1]
Career[edit]
He worked at McKinsey & Company for two years after getting his degrees.[1]
From 2000 to 2005 he was a partner at Polaris Venture Partners, a venture capital firm.[2]
Work at Polaris[edit]
In 2001, he worked with Robert Langer and other scientists to found Mimeon based on work by Langer on glycoengineering; the company changed its name to Momenta Pharmaceuticals the next year and went public in 2004.[2][3][4] Westphal was the founding CEO.[4] Momenta brought the first generic, low-molecular-weight heparin to market.[3]
In 2002 he co-founded Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which was built to discover and develop drugs and reagents based on RNA interference based on work done by scientists Phillip Sharp, Paul Schimmel, David Bartel, and Thomas Tuschl; John Maraganore was the founding CEO.[5][6] The company held its IPO in 2004, one of the few biotech companies able to do so in a down market.[7] As of 2016 Alnylam remained the dominant company in the RNAi field.[8][9]
In 2003 he co-founded Acceleron Pharma with scientists Jasbir Seehra, Tom Maniatis, Mark Ptashne, Wylie Vale, and scientific advisor Joan Massague, and John Knopf; Westphal served as founding CEO.[10][11] The company was founded to discover and develop drugs based on the scientific discoveries of the scientific founders in the field of growth factors and transforming growth factors in the fields of metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and muscle-wasting conditions.[12][13] The company went public in September 2013.[14]
In 2004, he co-founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals with Harvard biologist David Sinclair, serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel.[15][16] The company focused on resveratrol formulations and derivatives as activators of the SIRT1 enzyme.[15][15][17] The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of reservatrol.[18] Westphal and Sinclair aggressively marketed investment in the company as an anti-aging opportunity, which was controversial[15][19] but effective; Westphal raised $100 million in 2006.[19] In 2005 Westphal recruited Michelle Dipp to join the team at Sirtris; she would work with him in several subsequent ventures.[20]
Work after Polaris[edit]
In 2006, Westphal worked with Aldrich and Roger Tung to found and get seed funding for Concert Pharmaceuticals based on Tung's ideas about using deuterium to make deuterated drugs.[21] Westphal was not involved in the company by the time it went public in 2014.[22]
Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million.[23] GSK paid $22.50/share, when Sirtris's stock was trading at $12/share, down 45% from its highest price of the previous year.[24] Westphal was made CEO of the subsidiary and appointed Senior Vice President of GSK's Center of Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD) unit. Sirtris' science and claims were controversial; studies published in 2009 and early 2010 by scientists from Amgen and Pfizer cast doubt on whether SIRT1 was directly activated by resveratrol and showed that the apparent activity was actually due to a fluorescent reagent used in the experiments, and were widely discussed.[25][26][27][28]
In 2008, Westphal worked with Dipp, Aldrich, and Alexey Margolin to found Alnara Pharmaceuticals, which was created to develop ways to formulate biopharmaceuticals so they could be taken by mouth, instead of by injection.[20][29] Margolin had been CEO of Altus Therapeutics, which had been developing liprotamase, which it had licensed from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, but ran out of money. Alnara acquired the license and focused its resources on further developing liprotamase; Eli Lilly and Company acquired Alnara in July 2010 on the promise of that data acquired by Alnara.[30] Lilly submitted a new drug application to the FDA in 2011, which the FDA rejected, finding no clear benefit over existing products and requiring an additional clinical trial.[31] Lilly took a $122.6 million write-down on the value of the asset, and then sold it to Anthera Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[31]
In February 2010, Westphal formed a new venture fund called Longwood Founders Fund, together with Aldrich and Dipp.[32][33]
In April 2010, Westphal stepped down as CEO of Sirtris and as Senior VP of GSK's CEEDD and Dipp took over those roles; Westphal took over leadership of GSK's venture unit, SR One.[34][20]
In August 2010, a nonprofit called the Healthy Lifespan Institute, which had been formed the year before by Westphal and Dipp, began selling SRT501 as a dietary supplement online;[18] when this become public GSK required Westphal and Dipp, who were still GSK employees, to resign from the nonprofit.[35][36][37]
GSK/Sirtris terminated development of SRT501 in late 2010.[38][39] In 2013 GSK shut down Sirtris and its development candidates were absorbed into GSK, where research and development continued.[23][40][41]
Also in August 2010, the Longwood team co-founded VeraStem by providing seed funding and office space in its own offices, with Westphal serving as CEO and chairman of the board; Verastem aimed to isolate cancer stem cells and then discover drugs that would selectively kill them.[42][43] He brought the company public in 2012 and stepped down as CEO in 2013, as the company was getting ready to start a clinical trial of its lead product, a drug intended to treat mesothelioma.[43]
In April 2011, Westphal left SR One to focus on Longwood; news reports said that Dipp would soon leave GSK in order to focus on Longwood as well.[44]
In 2011, Westphal, Dipp. and Aldrich co-founded OvaScience with Jonathan Tilly and Sinclair, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian oogonial stem cells and work on mitochondria by Sinclair.[45][46] Tilly's work was controversial, with some groups unable to replicate it.[47][48] The company's claims about its services were controversial from their first announcements.[49] The company's A financing round was $6 million and it raised a $37 million B round in early 2012; Longwood participated in both rounds.[50] OvaScience held its public offering in 2012, and part of its pitch to investors was that its services would probably not be regulated by the FDA so it would probably be able to start generating significant revenue in the US by the end of 2013, but in 2013 the FDA ruled that it would need to file an investigational new drug application before it could start marketing the service; OvaScience's shares fell 40% in response.[51] By September 2016 OvaScience had raised and spent around $228 million.[52] In early December its shares were trading at around $3; in mid-December 2016 the company's shares fell around 50% when it announced layoffs and the departure of its CEO and chief operating officer in the face of sales continuing to fall below expectations.[53]
In 2014, he co-founded Flex Pharma with Jennifer Cermak (from Sirtris) based on work by scientific co-founders Roderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University and Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School.[54] MacKinnon and Bean invented a dietary supplement for treating and preventing muscle cramps in athletes that contained ginger extract, cinnamon extract and capsicum, and tested it in clinical trials.[55][56] In 2014 the company described itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders, pursuing treatments muscle cramping across a range of conditions including multiple sclerosis, ALS, and cramping in athletes, based on MacKinnon's Nobel Prize winning work on ion channels, and raised a $40 million Series A round.[54][57] The company had a $86 million initial public offering in 2015 and revealed the dietary supplement product and its intent to go to market as a dietary supplement company at that time.[56] The similarities with Sirtris' emphasis on reservatrol were noted at the time.[56] In 2016, Flex Pharma released the consumer product "HotShot" as a dietary supplement for endurance athletes.[58] In October 2016 the company released data from a clinical trial of its lead drug candidate for nocturnal leg cramps FLX-787, in which FLX-787 failed to meet the primary endpoints.[59][60] Westphal stepped down as CEO in June 2017 to return to working at Longwood fulltime; he retained the board chairmanship.[59]
Board positions[edit]
Westphal serves on the Board of Directors of Flex Pharma (Nasdaq FLKS) and the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School, the Board of Overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the board of Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), and he is a member of the Boston Commercial Club.[citation needed]
Media appearances[edit]
Westphal has been featured on 60 Minutes with Morley Safer,[61] CNN’s Vital Signs with Dr. Sanjay Gupta,[62] an ABC News Special hosted by Barbara Walters,[63] and as the subject of a Fortune cover article.[64]

In 2014, he co-founded Flex Pharma with Jennifer Cermak (from Sirtris) based on work by scientific co-founders Roderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University and Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School.[54] MacKinnon and Bean invented a dietary supplement for treating and preventing muscle cramps in athletes that contained ginger extract, cinnamon extract and capsicum, and tested it in clinical trials.[55][56] In 2014 the company described itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders, pursuing treatments muscle cramping across a range of conditions including multiple sclerosis, ALS, and cramping in athletes, based on MacKinnon's Nobel Prize winning work on ion channels, and raised a $40 million Series A round.[54][57] The company had a $86 million initial public offering in 2015 and revealed the dietary supplement product and its intent to go to market as a dietary supplement company at that time.[56] The similarities with Sirtris' emphasis on reservatrol were noted at the time.[56] In 2016, Flex Pharma released the consumer product "HotShot" as a dietary supplement for endurance athletes.[58] In October 2016 the company released data from a clinical trial of its lead drug candidate for nocturnal leg cramps FLX-787, in which FLX-787 failed to meet the primary endpoints.[59][60] Westphal stepped down as CEO in June 2017 to return to working at Longwood fulltime; he retained the board chairmanship.[59]

Westphal serves on the Board of Directors of Flex Pharma (Nasdaq FLKS) and the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School, the Board of Overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the board of Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), and he is a member of the Boston Commercial Club.[citation needed]

Background and training[edit]
He finished the MD–PhD program at Harvard University in six years.[1]
Career[edit]
He worked at McKinsey & Company for two years after getting his degrees.[1]
From 2000 to 2005 he was a partner at Polaris Venture Partners, a venture capital firm.[2]
Work at Polaris[edit]
In 2001, he worked with Robert Langer and other scientists to found Mimeon based on work by Langer on glycoengineering; the company changed its name to Momenta Pharmaceuticals the next year and went public in 2004.[2][3][4] Westphal was the founding CEO.[4] Momenta brought the first generic, low-molecular-weight heparin to market.[3]
In 2002 he co-founded Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which was built to discover and develop drugs and reagents based on RNA interference based on work done by scientists Phillip Sharp, Paul Schimmel, David Bartel, and Thomas Tuschl; John Maraganore was the founding CEO.[5][6] The company held its IPO in 2004, one of the few biotech companies able to do so in a down market.[7] As of 2016 Alnylam remained the dominant company in the RNAi field.[8][9]
In 2003 he co-founded Acceleron Pharma with scientists Jasbir Seehra, Tom Maniatis, Mark Ptashne, Wylie Vale, and scientific advisor Joan Massague, and John Knopf; Westphal served as founding CEO.[10][11] The company was founded to discover and develop drugs based on the scientific discoveries of the scientific founders in the field of growth factors and transforming growth factors in the fields of metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and muscle-wasting conditions.[12][13] The company went public in September 2013.[14]
In 2004, he co-founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals with Harvard biologist David Sinclair, serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel.[15][16] The company focused on resveratrol formulations and derivatives as activators of the SIRT1 enzyme.[15][15][17] The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of reservatrol.[18] Westphal and Sinclair aggressively marketed investment in the company as an anti-aging opportunity, which was controversial[15][19] but effective; Westphal raised $100 million in 2006.[19] In 2005 Westphal recruited Michelle Dipp to join the team at Sirtris; she would work with him in several subsequent ventures.[20]
Work after Polaris[edit]
In 2006, Westphal worked with Aldrich and Roger Tung to found and get seed funding for Concert Pharmaceuticals based on Tung's ideas about using deuterium to make deuterated drugs.[21] Westphal was not involved in the company by the time it went public in 2014.[22]
Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million.[23] GSK paid $22.50/share, when Sirtris's stock was trading at $12/share, down 45% from its highest price of the previous year.[24] Westphal was made CEO of the subsidiary and appointed Senior Vice President of GSK's Center of Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD) unit. Sirtris' science and claims were controversial; studies published in 2009 and early 2010 by scientists from Amgen and Pfizer cast doubt on whether SIRT1 was directly activated by resveratrol and showed that the apparent activity was actually due to a fluorescent reagent used in the experiments, and were widely discussed.[25][26][27][28]
In 2008, Westphal worked with Dipp, Aldrich, and Alexey Margolin to found Alnara Pharmaceuticals, which was created to develop ways to formulate biopharmaceuticals so they could be taken by mouth, instead of by injection.[20][29] Margolin had been CEO of Altus Therapeutics, which had been developing liprotamase, which it had licensed from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, but ran out of money. Alnara acquired the license and focused its resources on further developing liprotamase; Eli Lilly and Company acquired Alnara in July 2010 on the promise of that data acquired by Alnara.[30] Lilly submitted a new drug application to the FDA in 2011, which the FDA rejected, finding no clear benefit over existing products and requiring an additional clinical trial.[31] Lilly took a $122.6 million write-down on the value of the asset, and then sold it to Anthera Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[31]
In February 2010, Westphal formed a new venture fund called Longwood Founders Fund, together with Aldrich and Dipp.[32][33]
In April 2010, Westphal stepped down as CEO of Sirtris and as Senior VP of GSK's CEEDD and Dipp took over those roles; Westphal took over leadership of GSK's venture unit, SR One.[34][20]
In August 2010, a nonprofit called the Healthy Lifespan Institute, which had been formed the year before by Westphal and Dipp, began selling SRT501 as a dietary supplement online;[18] when this become public GSK required Westphal and Dipp, who were still GSK employees, to resign from the nonprofit.[35][36][37]
GSK/Sirtris terminated development of SRT501 in late 2010.[38][39] In 2013 GSK shut down Sirtris and its development candidates were absorbed into GSK, where research and development continued.[23][40][41]
Also in August 2010, the Longwood team co-founded VeraStem by providing seed funding and office space in its own offices, with Westphal serving as CEO and chairman of the board; Verastem aimed to isolate cancer stem cells and then discover drugs that would selectively kill them.[42][43] He brought the company public in 2012 and stepped down as CEO in 2013, as the company was getting ready to start a clinical trial of its lead product, a drug intended to treat mesothelioma.[43]
In April 2011, Westphal left SR One to focus on Longwood; news reports said that Dipp would soon leave GSK in order to focus on Longwood as well.[44]
In 2011, Westphal, Dipp. and Aldrich co-founded OvaScience with Jonathan Tilly and Sinclair, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian oogonial stem cells and work on mitochondria by Sinclair.[45][46] Tilly's work was controversial, with some groups unable to replicate it.[47][48] The company's claims about its services were controversial from their first announcements.[49] The company's A financing round was $6 million and it raised a $37 million B round in early 2012; Longwood participated in both rounds.[50] OvaScience held its public offering in 2012, and part of its pitch to investors was that its services would probably not be regulated by the FDA so it would probably be able to start generating significant revenue in the US by the end of 2013, but in 2013 the FDA ruled that it would need to file an investigational new drug application before it could start marketing the service; OvaScience's shares fell 40% in response.[51] By September 2016 OvaScience had raised and spent around $228 million.[52] In early December its shares were trading at around $3; in mid-December 2016 the company's shares fell around 50% when it announced layoffs and the departure of its CEO and chief operating officer in the face of sales continuing to fall below expectations.[53]
In 2014, he co-founded Flex Pharma with Jennifer Cermak (from Sirtris) based on work by scientific co-founders Roderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University and Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School.[54] MacKinnon and Bean invented a dietary supplement for treating and preventing muscle cramps in athletes that contained ginger extract, cinnamon extract and capsicum, and tested it in clinical trials.[55][56] In 2014 the company described itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders, pursuing treatments muscle cramping across a range of conditions including multiple sclerosis, ALS, and cramping in athletes, based on MacKinnon's Nobel Prize winning work on ion channels, and raised a $40 million Series A round.[54][57] The company had a $86 million initial public offering in 2015 and revealed the dietary supplement product and its intent to go to market as a dietary supplement company at that time.[56] The similarities with Sirtris' emphasis on reservatrol were noted at the time.[56] In 2016, Flex Pharma released the consumer product "HotShot" as a dietary supplement for endurance athletes.[58] In October 2016 the company released data from a clinical trial of its lead drug candidate for nocturnal leg cramps FLX-787, in which FLX-787 failed to meet the primary endpoints.[59][60] Westphal stepped down as CEO in June 2017 to return to working at Longwood fulltime; he retained the board chairmanship.[59]

Westphal serves on the Board of Directors of Flex Pharma (Nasdaq FLKS) and the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School, the Board of Overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the board of Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), and he is a member of the Boston Commercial Club.[citation needed]

Background and training[edit]
He finished the MD–PhD program at Harvard University in six years.[1]
Career[edit]
He worked at McKinsey & Company for two years after getting his degrees.[1]
From 2000 to 2005 he was a partner at Polaris Venture Partners, a venture capital firm.[2]
Work at Polaris[edit]
In 2001, he worked with Robert Langer and other scientists to found Mimeon based on work by Langer on glycoengineering; the company changed its name to Momenta Pharmaceuticals the next year and went public in 2004.[2][3][4] Westphal was the founding CEO.[4] Momenta brought the first generic, low-molecular-weight heparin to market.[3]
In 2002 he co-founded Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which was built to discover and develop drugs and reagents based on RNA interference based on work done by scientists Phillip Sharp, Paul Schimmel, David Bartel, and Thomas Tuschl; John Maraganore was the founding CEO.[5][6] The company held its IPO in 2004, one of the few biotech companies able to do so in a down market.[7] As of 2016 Alnylam remained the dominant company in the RNAi field.[8][9]
In 2003 he co-founded Acceleron Pharma with scientists Jasbir Seehra, Tom Maniatis, Mark Ptashne, Wylie Vale, and scientific advisor Joan Massague, and John Knopf; Westphal served as founding CEO.[10][11] The company was founded to discover and develop drugs based on the scientific discoveries of the scientific founders in the field of growth factors and transforming growth factors in the fields of metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and muscle-wasting conditions.[12][13] The company went public in September 2013.[14]
In 2004, he co-founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals with Harvard biologist David Sinclair, serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel.[15][16] The company focused on resveratrol formulations and derivatives as activators of the SIRT1 enzyme.[15][15][17] The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of reservatrol.[18] Westphal and Sinclair aggressively marketed investment in the company as an anti-aging opportunity, which was controversial[15][19] but effective; Westphal raised $100 million in 2006.[19] In 2005 Westphal recruited Michelle Dipp to join the team at Sirtris; she would work with him in several subsequent ventures.[20]
Work after Polaris[edit]
In 2006, Westphal worked with Aldrich and Roger Tung to found and get seed funding for Concert Pharmaceuticals based on Tung's ideas about using deuterium to make deuterated drugs.[21] Westphal was not involved in the company by the time it went public in 2014.[22]
Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million.[23] GSK paid $22.50/share, when Sirtris's stock was trading at $12/share, down 45% from its highest price of the previous year.[24] Westphal was made CEO of the subsidiary and appointed Senior Vice President of GSK's Center of Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD) unit. Sirtris' science and claims were controversial; studies published in 2009 and early 2010 by scientists from Amgen and Pfizer cast doubt on whether SIRT1 was directly activated by resveratrol and showed that the apparent activity was actually due to a fluorescent reagent used in the experiments, and were widely discussed.[25][26][27][28]
In 2008, Westphal worked with Dipp, Aldrich, and Alexey Margolin to found Alnara Pharmaceuticals, which was created to develop ways to formulate biopharmaceuticals so they could be taken by mouth, instead of by injection.[20][29] Margolin had been CEO of Altus Therapeutics, which had been developing liprotamase, which it had licensed from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, but ran out of money. Alnara acquired the license and focused its resources on further developing liprotamase; Eli Lilly and Company acquired Alnara in July 2010 on the promise of that data acquired by Alnara.[30] Lilly submitted a new drug application to the FDA in 2011, which the FDA rejected, finding no clear benefit over existing products and requiring an additional clinical trial.[31] Lilly took a $122.6 million write-down on the value of the asset, and then sold it to Anthera Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[31]
In February 2010, Westphal formed a new venture fund called Longwood Founders Fund, together with Aldrich and Dipp.[32][33]
In April 2010, Westphal stepped down as CEO of Sirtris and as Senior VP of GSK's CEEDD and Dipp took over those roles; Westphal took over leadership of GSK's venture unit, SR One.[34][20]
In August 2010, a nonprofit called the Healthy Lifespan Institute, which had been formed the year before by Westphal and Dipp, began selling SRT501 as a dietary supplement online;[18] when this become public GSK required Westphal and Dipp, who were still GSK employees, to resign from the nonprofit.[35][36][37]
GSK/Sirtris terminated development of SRT501 in late 2010.[38][39] In 2013 GSK shut down Sirtris and its development candidates were absorbed into GSK, where research and development continued.[23][40][41]
Also in August 2010, the Longwood team co-founded VeraStem by providing seed funding and office space in its own offices, with Westphal serving as CEO and chairman of the board; Verastem aimed to isolate cancer stem cells and then discover drugs that would selectively kill them.[42][43] He brought the company public in 2012 and stepped down as CEO in 2013, as the company was getting ready to start a clinical trial of its lead product, a drug intended to treat mesothelioma.[43]
In April 2011, Westphal left SR One to focus on Longwood; news reports said that Dipp would soon leave GSK in order to focus on Longwood as well.[44]
In 2011, Westphal, Dipp. and Aldrich co-founded OvaScience with Jonathan Tilly and Sinclair, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian oogonial stem cells and work on mitochondria by Sinclair.[45][46] Tilly's work was controversial, with some groups unable to replicate it.[47][48] The company's claims about its services were controversial from their first announcements.[49] The company's A financing round was $6 million and it raised a $37 million B round in early 2012; Longwood participated in both rounds.[50] OvaScience held its public offering in 2012, and part of its pitch to investors was that its services would probably not be regulated by the FDA so it would probably be able to start generating significant revenue in the US by the end of 2013, but in 2013 the FDA ruled that it would need to file an investigational new drug application before it could start marketing the service; OvaScience's shares fell 40% in response.[51] By September 2016 OvaScience had raised and spent around $228 million.[52] In early December its shares were trading at around $3; in mid-December 2016 the company's shares fell around 50% when it announced layoffs and the departure of its CEO and chief operating officer in the face of sales continuing to fall below expectations.[53]
In 2014, he co-founded Flex Pharma with Jennifer Cermak (from Sirtris) based on work by scientific co-founders Roderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University and Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School.[54] MacKinnon and Bean invented a dietary supplement for treating and preventing muscle cramps in athletes that contained ginger extract, cinnamon extract and capsicum, and tested it in clinical trials.[55][56] In 2014 the company described itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders, pursuing treatments muscle cramping across a range of conditions including multiple sclerosis, ALS, and cramping in athletes, based on MacKinnon's Nobel Prize winning work on ion channels, and raised a $40 million Series A round.[54][57] The company had a $86 million initial public offering in 2015 and revealed the dietary supplement product and its intent to go to market as a dietary supplement company at that time.[56] The similarities with Sirtris' emphasis on reservatrol were noted at the time.[56] In 2016, Flex Pharma released the consumer product "HotShot" as a dietary supplement for endurance athletes.[58] In October 2016 the company released data from a clinical trial of its lead drug candidate for nocturnal leg cramps FLX-787, in which FLX-787 failed to meet the primary endpoints.[59][60] Westphal stepped down as CEO in June 2017 to return to working at Longwood fulltime; he retained the board chairmanship.[59]
Board positions[edit]
Westphal serves on the Board of Directors of Flex Pharma (Nasdaq FLKS) and the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School, the Board of Overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the board of Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), and he is a member of the Boston Commercial Club.[citation needed]
Media appearances[edit]
Westphal has been featured on 60 Minutes with Morley Safer,[61] CNN’s Vital Signs with Dr. Sanjay Gupta,[62] an ABC News Special hosted by Barbara Walters,[63] and as the subject of a Fortune cover article.[64]

Background and training[edit]
He finished the MD–PhD program at Harvard University in six years.[1]
Career[edit]
He worked at McKinsey & Company for two years after getting his degrees.[1]
From 2000 to 2005 he was a partner at Polaris Venture Partners, a venture capital firm.[2]
Work at Polaris[edit]
In 2001, he worked with Robert Langer and other scientists to found Mimeon based on work by Langer on glycoengineering; the company changed its name to Momenta Pharmaceuticals the next year and went public in 2004.[2][3][4] Westphal was the founding CEO.[4] Momenta brought the first generic, low-molecular-weight heparin to market.[3]
In 2002 he co-founded Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which was built to discover and develop drugs and reagents based on RNA interference based on work done by scientists Phillip Sharp, Paul Schimmel, David Bartel, and Thomas Tuschl; John Maraganore was the founding CEO.[5][6] The company held its IPO in 2004, one of the few biotech companies able to do so in a down market.[7] As of 2016 Alnylam remained the dominant company in the RNAi field.[8][9]
In 2003 he co-founded Acceleron Pharma with scientists Jasbir Seehra, Tom Maniatis, Mark Ptashne, Wylie Vale, and scientific advisor Joan Massague, and John Knopf; Westphal served as founding CEO.[10][11] The company was founded to discover and develop drugs based on the scientific discoveries of the scientific founders in the field of growth factors and transforming growth factors in the fields of metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and muscle-wasting conditions.[12][13] The company went public in September 2013.[14]
In 2004, he co-founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals with Harvard biologist David Sinclair, serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel.[15][16] The company focused on resveratrol formulations and derivatives as activators of the SIRT1 enzyme.[15][15][17] The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of reservatrol.[18] Westphal and Sinclair aggressively marketed investment in the company as an anti-aging opportunity, which was controversial[15][19] but effective; Westphal raised $100 million in 2006.[19] In 2005 Westphal recruited Michelle Dipp to join the team at Sirtris; she would work with him in several subsequent ventures.[20]
Work after Polaris[edit]
In 2006, Westphal worked with Aldrich and Roger Tung to found and get seed funding for Concert Pharmaceuticals based on Tung's ideas about using deuterium to make deuterated drugs.[21] Westphal was not involved in the company by the time it went public in 2014.[22]
Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million.[23] GSK paid $22.50/share, when Sirtris's stock was trading at $12/share, down 45% from its highest price of the previous year.[24] Westphal was made CEO of the subsidiary and appointed Senior Vice President of GSK's Center of Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD) unit. Sirtris' science and claims were controversial; studies published in 2009 and early 2010 by scientists from Amgen and Pfizer cast doubt on whether SIRT1 was directly activated by resveratrol and showed that the apparent activity was actually due to a fluorescent reagent used in the experiments, and were widely discussed.[25][26][27][28]
In 2008, Westphal worked with Dipp, Aldrich, and Alexey Margolin to found Alnara Pharmaceuticals, which was created to develop ways to formulate biopharmaceuticals so they could be taken by mouth, instead of by injection.[20][29] Margolin had been CEO of Altus Therapeutics, which had been developing liprotamase, which it had licensed from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, but ran out of money. Alnara acquired the license and focused its resources on further developing liprotamase; Eli Lilly and Company acquired Alnara in July 2010 on the promise of that data acquired by Alnara.[30] Lilly submitted a new drug application to the FDA in 2011, which the FDA rejected, finding no clear benefit over existing products and requiring an additional clinical trial.[31] Lilly took a $122.6 million write-down on the value of the asset, and then sold it to Anthera Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[31]
In February 2010, Westphal formed a new venture fund called Longwood Founders Fund, together with Aldrich and Dipp.[32][33]
In April 2010, Westphal stepped down as CEO of Sirtris and as Senior VP of GSK's CEEDD and Dipp took over those roles; Westphal took over leadership of GSK's venture unit, SR One.[34][20]
In August 2010, a nonprofit called the Healthy Lifespan Institute, which had been formed the year before by Westphal and Dipp, began selling SRT501 as a dietary supplement online;[18] when this become public GSK required Westphal and Dipp, who were still GSK employees, to resign from the nonprofit.[35][36][37]
GSK/Sirtris terminated development of SRT501 in late 2010.[38][39] In 2013 GSK shut down Sirtris and its development candidates were absorbed into GSK, where research and development continued.[23][40][41]
Also in August 2010, the Longwood team co-founded VeraStem by providing seed funding and office space in its own offices, with Westphal serving as CEO and chairman of the board; Verastem aimed to isolate cancer stem cells and then discover drugs that would selectively kill them.[42][43] He brought the company public in 2012 and stepped down as CEO in 2013, as the company was getting ready to start a clinical trial of its lead product, a drug intended to treat mesothelioma.[43]
In April 2011, Westphal left SR One to focus on Longwood; news reports said that Dipp would soon leave GSK in order to focus on Longwood as well.[44]
In 2011, Westphal, Dipp. and Aldrich co-founded OvaScience with Jonathan Tilly and Sinclair, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian oogonial stem cells and work on mitochondria by Sinclair.[45][46] Tilly's work was controversial, with some groups unable to replicate it.[47][48] The company's claims about its services were controversial from their first announcements.[49] The company's A financing round was $6 million and it raised a $37 million B round in early 2012; Longwood participated in both rounds.[50] OvaScience held its public offering in 2012, and part of its pitch to investors was that its services would probably not be regulated by the FDA so it would probably be able to start generating significant revenue in the US by the end of 2013, but in 2013 the FDA ruled that it would need to file an investigational new drug application before it could start marketing the service; OvaScience's shares fell 40% in response.[51] By September 2016 OvaScience had raised and spent around $228 million.[52] In early December its shares were trading at around $3; in mid-December 2016 the company's shares fell around 50% when it announced layoffs and the departure of its CEO and chief operating officer in the face of sales continuing to fall below expectations.[53]
In 2014, he co-founded Flex Pharma with Jennifer Cermak (from Sirtris) based on work by scientific co-founders Roderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University and Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School.[54] MacKinnon and Bean invented a dietary supplement for treating and preventing muscle cramps in athletes that contained ginger extract, cinnamon extract and capsicum, and tested it in clinical trials.[55][56] In 2014 the company described itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders, pursuing treatments muscle cramping across a range of conditions including multiple sclerosis, ALS, and cramping in athletes, based on MacKinnon's Nobel Prize winning work on ion channels, and raised a $40 million Series A round.[54][57] The company had a $86 million initial public offering in 2015 and revealed the dietary supplement product and its intent to go to market as a dietary supplement company at that time.[56] The similarities with Sirtris' emphasis on reservatrol were noted at the time.[56] In 2016, Flex Pharma released the consumer product "HotShot" as a dietary supplement for endurance athletes.[58] In October 2016 the company released data from a clinical trial of its lead drug candidate for nocturnal leg cramps FLX-787, in which FLX-787 failed to meet the primary endpoints.[59][60] Westphal stepped down as CEO in June 2017 to return to working at Longwood fulltime; he retained the board chairmanship.[59]
Board positions[edit]
Westphal serves on the Board of Directors of Flex Pharma (Nasdaq FLKS) and the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School, the Board of Overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the board of Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), and he is a member of the Boston Commercial Club.[citation needed]
Media appearances[edit]
Westphal has been featured on 60 Minutes with Morley Safer,[61] CNN’s Vital Signs with Dr. Sanjay Gupta,[62] an ABC News Special hosted by Barbara Walters,[63] and as the subject of a Fortune cover article.[64]

In 2014, he co-founded Flex Pharma with Jennifer Cermak (from Sirtris) based on work by scientific co-founders Roderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University and Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School.[54] MacKinnon and Bean invented a dietary supplement for treating and preventing muscle cramps in athletes that contained ginger extract, cinnamon extract and capsicum, and tested it in clinical trials.[55][56] In 2014 the company described itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders, pursuing treatments muscle cramping across a range of conditions including multiple sclerosis, ALS, and cramping in athletes, based on MacKinnon's Nobel Prize winning work on ion channels, and raised a $40 million Series A round.[54][57] The company had a $86 million initial public offering in 2015 and revealed the dietary supplement product and its intent to go to market as a dietary supplement company at that time.[56] The similarities with Sirtris' emphasis on reservatrol were noted at the time.[56] In 2016, Flex Pharma released the consumer product "HotShot" as a dietary supplement for endurance athletes.[58] In October 2016 the company released data from a clinical trial of its lead drug candidate for nocturnal leg cramps FLX-787, in which FLX-787 failed to meet the primary endpoints.[59][60] Westphal stepped down as CEO in June 2017 to return to working at Longwood fulltime; he retained the board chairmanship.[59]
Board positions[edit]
Westphal serves on the Board of Directors of Flex Pharma (Nasdaq FLKS) and the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School, the Board of Overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the board of Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), and he is a member of the Boston Commercial Club.[citation needed]
Media appearances[edit]
Westphal has been featured on 60 Minutes with Morley Safer,[61] CNN’s Vital Signs with Dr. Sanjay Gupta,[62] an ABC News Special hosted by Barbara Walters,[63] and as the subject of a Fortune cover article.[64]

            To Fight Cramps, Christoph Westphal Taps Boston All-Stars for $40M

Boston         — 
      
Serial biotech executive Christoph Westphal looks to have found his latest target: muscle cramps.
Westphal, perhaps best known as the one-time CEO of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, is now chairman and CEO of a new startup called Flex Pharma. He’s gone through the rolodex to put together $40 million in private financing from a diverse list of big-name investors: venture firms, biotech executives, even the owners of the Hub’s local sports teams.
Among Flex’s backers are Westphal’s own venture fund (Longwood Fund): VC firms such as Lightstone Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, City Hill Ventures, and EcoR1 Capital; the owners of two of Boston’s professional sports teams (the Kraft Group, owned by Patriots owner Bob Kraft; and Celtics CEO and managing partner Wyc Grousbeck); former Apple CEO John Sculley and his wife Diane; and current Alnylam Pharmaceuticals CEO John Maraganore.
Flex officials couldn’t be immediately reached for comment late Monday, and it hasn’t divulged much information, but it bills itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders and says it’s advancing a treatment to prevent muscle cramps. One of Flex’s scientific founders, Harvard Medical School professor Bruce Bean, says in a video on the company’s site that the company is looking at treatments for “all forms of muscle cramps,” including those experienced by athletes, elderly folks who get cramps at night, and those attributed to diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis.
For cramps brought on by disease, Flex appears to be developing prescription drugs. For athletes suffering from cramps, the targeted product seems to be medical foods.
The general idea, according to the website, is to stimulate nerve endings in the mouth and esophagus, which should affect the activity of alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord. Those are the neurons responsible for muscle contractions that cause cramps when they excessively fire.
Flex says it’s basing its products on new research that shows that cramps begin in the nerves, not the muscles. Therefore it claims most common remedies like bananas and sports drinks don’t usually work. The company says it will reveal data from two small studies testing its theory at a future medical meeting, and that it plans to run efficacy studies in 2015.
Christoph Westphal
Westphal founded the company with Rockefeller University professor Roderick MacKinnon (who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2003 for work he did in ion channel activation), Bean, and former Sirtris colleague Jennifer Cermak, the vice president of program management at the company. Longtime Westphal comrades Rich Aldrich and Michelle Dipp (now the CEO of OvaScience) are listed as advisors, along with Maraganore, and Bain Capital and Celtics managing partner Steve Pagliuca.
It’s no surprise that Flex has raised cash from such big-name sources with Westphal at the helm. He helped found companies like Alnylam (NASDAQ: ALNY), Momenta Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MNTA), Acceleron Pharma (NASDAQ: XLRN), and Verastem (NASDAQ: VSTM) all of which are now publicly traded. He also founded and ran Sirtris, the controversial anti-aging biotech firm that GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) bought in 2008 for $720 million (and later shuttered in 2013).
Westphal began his entrepreneurial career at Polaris Partners in 2000, the platform for several of his startups. After the Sirtris sale, he stayed on at GSK to run its SR One venture arm, then stepped down to start the Longwood Fund with Dipp and Aldrich. He stepped down as Verastem’s CEO in June 2013, but remains the company’s executive chairman and is still a major stockholder.

Background and training[edit]
He finished the MD–PhD program at Harvard University in six years.[1]
Career[edit]
He worked at McKinsey & Company for two years after getting his degrees.[1]
From 2000 to 2005 he was a partner at Polaris Venture Partners, a venture capital firm.[2]
Work at Polaris[edit]
In 2001, he worked with Robert Langer and other scientists to found Mimeon based on work by Langer on glycoengineering; the company changed its name to Momenta Pharmaceuticals the next year and went public in 2004.[2][3][4] Westphal was the founding CEO.[4] Momenta brought the first generic, low-molecular-weight heparin to market.[3]
In 2002 he co-founded Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which was built to discover and develop drugs and reagents based on RNA interference based on work done by scientists Phillip Sharp, Paul Schimmel, David Bartel, and Thomas Tuschl; John Maraganore was the founding CEO.[5][6] The company held its IPO in 2004, one of the few biotech companies able to do so in a down market.[7] As of 2016 Alnylam remained the dominant company in the RNAi field.[8][9]
In 2003 he co-founded Acceleron Pharma with scientists Jasbir Seehra, Tom Maniatis, Mark Ptashne, Wylie Vale, and scientific advisor Joan Massague, and John Knopf; Westphal served as founding CEO.[10][11] The company was founded to discover and develop drugs based on the scientific discoveries of the scientific founders in the field of growth factors and transforming growth factors in the fields of metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and muscle-wasting conditions.[12][13] The company went public in September 2013.[14]
In 2004, he co-founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals with Harvard biologist David Sinclair, serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel.[15][16] The company focused on resveratrol formulations and derivatives as activators of the SIRT1 enzyme.[15][15][17] The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of reservatrol.[18] Westphal and Sinclair aggressively marketed investment in the company as an anti-aging opportunity, which was controversial[15][19] but effective; Westphal raised $100 million in 2006.[19] In 2005 Westphal recruited Michelle Dipp to join the team at Sirtris; she would work with him in several subsequent ventures.[20]
Work after Polaris[edit]
In 2006, Westphal worked with Aldrich and Roger Tung to found and get seed funding for Concert Pharmaceuticals based on Tung's ideas about using deuterium to make deuterated drugs.[21] Westphal was not involved in the company by the time it went public in 2014.[22]
Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million.[23] GSK paid $22.50/share, when Sirtris's stock was trading at $12/share, down 45% from its highest price of the previous year.[24] Westphal was made CEO of the subsidiary and appointed Senior Vice President of GSK's Center of Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD) unit. Sirtris' science and claims were controversial; studies published in 2009 and early 2010 by scientists from Amgen and Pfizer cast doubt on whether SIRT1 was directly activated by resveratrol and showed that the apparent activity was actually due to a fluorescent reagent used in the experiments, and were widely discussed.[25][26][27][28]
In 2008, Westphal worked with Dipp, Aldrich, and Alexey Margolin to found Alnara Pharmaceuticals, which was created to develop ways to formulate biopharmaceuticals so they could be taken by mouth, instead of by injection.[20][29] Margolin had been CEO of Altus Therapeutics, which had been developing liprotamase, which it had licensed from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, but ran out of money. Alnara acquired the license and focused its resources on further developing liprotamase; Eli Lilly and Company acquired Alnara in July 2010 on the promise of that data acquired by Alnara.[30] Lilly submitted a new drug application to the FDA in 2011, which the FDA rejected, finding no clear benefit over existing products and requiring an additional clinical trial.[31] Lilly took a $122.6 million write-down on the value of the asset, and then sold it to Anthera Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[31]
In February 2010, Westphal formed a new venture fund called Longwood Founders Fund, together with Aldrich and Dipp.[32][33]
In April 2010, Westphal stepped down as CEO of Sirtris and as Senior VP of GSK's CEEDD and Dipp took over those roles; Westphal took over leadership of GSK's venture unit, SR One.[34][20]
In August 2010, a nonprofit called the Healthy Lifespan Institute, which had been formed the year before by Westphal and Dipp, began selling SRT501 as a dietary supplement online;[18] when this become public GSK required Westphal and Dipp, who were still GSK employees, to resign from the nonprofit.[35][36][37]
GSK/Sirtris terminated development of SRT501 in late 2010.[38][39] In 2013 GSK shut down Sirtris and its development candidates were absorbed into GSK, where research and development continued.[23][40][41]
Also in August 2010, the Longwood team co-founded VeraStem by providing seed funding and office space in its own offices, with Westphal serving as CEO and chairman of the board; Verastem aimed to isolate cancer stem cells and then discover drugs that would selectively kill them.[42][43] He brought the company public in 2012 and stepped down as CEO in 2013, as the company was getting ready to start a clinical trial of its lead product, a drug intended to treat mesothelioma.[43]
In April 2011, Westphal left SR One to focus on Longwood; news reports said that Dipp would soon leave GSK in order to focus on Longwood as well.[44]
In 2011, Westphal, Dipp. and Aldrich co-founded OvaScience with Jonathan Tilly and Sinclair, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian oogonial stem cells and work on mitochondria by Sinclair.[45][46] Tilly's work was controversial, with some groups unable to replicate it.[47][48] The company's claims about its services were controversial from their first announcements.[49] The company's A financing round was $6 million and it raised a $37 million B round in early 2012; Longwood participated in both rounds.[50] OvaScience held its public offering in 2012, and part of its pitch to investors was that its services would probably not be regulated by the FDA so it would probably be able to start generating significant revenue in the US by the end of 2013, but in 2013 the FDA ruled that it would need to file an investigational new drug application before it could start marketing the service; OvaScience's shares fell 40% in response.[51] By September 2016 OvaScience had raised and spent around $228 million.[52] In early December its shares were trading at around $3; in mid-December 2016 the company's shares fell around 50% when it announced layoffs and the departure of its CEO and chief operating officer in the face of sales continuing to fall below expectations.[53]
In 2014, he co-founded Flex Pharma with Jennifer Cermak (from Sirtris) based on work by scientific co-founders Roderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University and Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School.[54] MacKinnon and Bean invented a dietary supplement for treating and preventing muscle cramps in athletes that contained ginger extract, cinnamon extract and capsicum, and tested it in clinical trials.[55][56] In 2014 the company described itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders, pursuing treatments muscle cramping across a range of conditions including multiple sclerosis, ALS, and cramping in athletes, based on MacKinnon's Nobel Prize winning work on ion channels, and raised a $40 million Series A round.[54][57] The company had a $86 million initial public offering in 2015 and revealed the dietary supplement product and its intent to go to market as a dietary supplement company at that time.[56] The similarities with Sirtris' emphasis on reservatrol were noted at the time.[56] In 2016, Flex Pharma released the consumer product "HotShot" as a dietary supplement for endurance athletes.[58] In October 2016 the company released data from a clinical trial of its lead drug candidate for nocturnal leg cramps FLX-787, in which FLX-787 failed to meet the primary endpoints.[59][60] Westphal stepped down as CEO in June 2017 to return to working at Longwood fulltime; he retained the board chairmanship.[59]
Board positions[edit]
Westphal serves on the Board of Directors of Flex Pharma (Nasdaq FLKS) and the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School, the Board of Overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the board of Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), and he is a member of the Boston Commercial Club.[citation needed]
Media appearances[edit]
Westphal has been featured on 60 Minutes with Morley Safer,[61] CNN’s Vital Signs with Dr. Sanjay Gupta,[62] an ABC News Special hosted by Barbara Walters,[63] and as the subject of a Fortune cover article.[64]

Background and training[edit]
He finished the MD–PhD program at Harvard University in six years.[1]
Career[edit]
He worked at McKinsey & Company for two years after getting his degrees.[1]
From 2000 to 2005 he was a partner at Polaris Venture Partners, a venture capital firm.[2]
Work at Polaris[edit]
In 2001, he worked with Robert Langer and other scientists to found Mimeon based on work by Langer on glycoengineering; the company changed its name to Momenta Pharmaceuticals the next year and went public in 2004.[2][3][4] Westphal was the founding CEO.[4] Momenta brought the first generic, low-molecular-weight heparin to market.[3]
In 2002 he co-founded Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which was built to discover and develop drugs and reagents based on RNA interference based on work done by scientists Phillip Sharp, Paul Schimmel, David Bartel, and Thomas Tuschl; John Maraganore was the founding CEO.[5][6] The company held its IPO in 2004, one of the few biotech companies able to do so in a down market.[7] As of 2016 Alnylam remained the dominant company in the RNAi field.[8][9]
In 2003 he co-founded Acceleron Pharma with scientists Jasbir Seehra, Tom Maniatis, Mark Ptashne, Wylie Vale, and scientific advisor Joan Massague, and John Knopf; Westphal served as founding CEO.[10][11] The company was founded to discover and develop drugs based on the scientific discoveries of the scientific founders in the field of growth factors and transforming growth factors in the fields of metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and muscle-wasting conditions.[12][13] The company went public in September 2013.[14]
In 2004, he co-founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals with Harvard biologist David Sinclair, serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel.[15][16] The company focused on resveratrol formulations and derivatives as activators of the SIRT1 enzyme.[15][15][17] The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of reservatrol.[18] Westphal and Sinclair aggressively marketed investment in the company as an anti-aging opportunity, which was controversial[15][19] but effective; Westphal raised $100 million in 2006.[19] In 2005 Westphal recruited Michelle Dipp to join the team at Sirtris; she would work with him in several subsequent ventures.[20]
Work after Polaris[edit]
In 2006, Westphal worked with Aldrich and Roger Tung to found and get seed funding for Concert Pharmaceuticals based on Tung's ideas about using deuterium to make deuterated drugs.[21] Westphal was not involved in the company by the time it went public in 2014.[22]
Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million.[23] GSK paid $22.50/share, when Sirtris's stock was trading at $12/share, down 45% from its highest price of the previous year.[24] Westphal was made CEO of the subsidiary and appointed Senior Vice President of GSK's Center of Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD) unit. Sirtris' science and claims were controversial; studies published in 2009 and early 2010 by scientists from Amgen and Pfizer cast doubt on whether SIRT1 was directly activated by resveratrol and showed that the apparent activity was actually due to a fluorescent reagent used in the experiments, and were widely discussed.[25][26][27][28]
In 2008, Westphal worked with Dipp, Aldrich, and Alexey Margolin to found Alnara Pharmaceuticals, which was created to develop ways to formulate biopharmaceuticals so they could be taken by mouth, instead of by injection.[20][29] Margolin had been CEO of Altus Therapeutics, which had been developing liprotamase, which it had licensed from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, but ran out of money. Alnara acquired the license and focused its resources on further developing liprotamase; Eli Lilly and Company acquired Alnara in July 2010 on the promise of that data acquired by Alnara.[30] Lilly submitted a new drug application to the FDA in 2011, which the FDA rejected, finding no clear benefit over existing products and requiring an additional clinical trial.[31] Lilly took a $122.6 million write-down on the value of the asset, and then sold it to Anthera Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[31]
In February 2010, Westphal formed a new venture fund called Longwood Founders Fund, together with Aldrich and Dipp.[32][33]
In April 2010, Westphal stepped down as CEO of Sirtris and as Senior VP of GSK's CEEDD and Dipp took over those roles; Westphal took over leadership of GSK's venture unit, SR One.[34][20]
In August 2010, a nonprofit called the Healthy Lifespan Institute, which had been formed the year before by Westphal and Dipp, began selling SRT501 as a dietary supplement online;[18] when this become public GSK required Westphal and Dipp, who were still GSK employees, to resign from the nonprofit.[35][36][37]
GSK/Sirtris terminated development of SRT501 in late 2010.[38][39] In 2013 GSK shut down Sirtris and its development candidates were absorbed into GSK, where research and development continued.[23][40][41]
Also in August 2010, the Longwood team co-founded VeraStem by providing seed funding and office space in its own offices, with Westphal serving as CEO and chairman of the board; Verastem aimed to isolate cancer stem cells and then discover drugs that would selectively kill them.[42][43] He brought the company public in 2012 and stepped down as CEO in 2013, as the company was getting ready to start a clinical trial of its lead product, a drug intended to treat mesothelioma.[43]
In April 2011, Westphal left SR One to focus on Longwood; news reports said that Dipp would soon leave GSK in order to focus on Longwood as well.[44]
In 2011, Westphal, Dipp. and Aldrich co-founded OvaScience with Jonathan Tilly and Sinclair, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian oogonial stem cells and work on mitochondria by Sinclair.[45][46] Tilly's work was controversial, with some groups unable to replicate it.[47][48] The company's claims about its services were controversial from their first announcements.[49] The company's A financing round was $6 million and it raised a $37 million B round in early 2012; Longwood participated in both rounds.[50] OvaScience held its public offering in 2012, and part of its pitch to investors was that its services would probably not be regulated by the FDA so it would probably be able to start generating significant revenue in the US by the end of 2013, but in 2013 the FDA ruled that it would need to file an investigational new drug application before it could start marketing the service; OvaScience's shares fell 40% in response.[51] By September 2016 OvaScience had raised and spent around $228 million.[52] In early December its shares were trading at around $3; in mid-December 2016 the company's shares fell around 50% when it announced layoffs and the departure of its CEO and chief operating officer in the face of sales continuing to fall below expectations.[53]
In 2014, he co-founded Flex Pharma with Jennifer Cermak (from Sirtris) based on work by scientific co-founders Roderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University and Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School.[54] MacKinnon and Bean invented a dietary supplement for treating and preventing muscle cramps in athletes that contained ginger extract, cinnamon extract and capsicum, and tested it in clinical trials.[55][56] In 2014 the company described itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders, pursuing treatments muscle cramping across a range of conditions including multiple sclerosis, ALS, and cramping in athletes, based on MacKinnon's Nobel Prize winning work on ion channels, and raised a $40 million Series A round.[54][57] The company had a $86 million initial public offering in 2015 and revealed the dietary supplement product and its intent to go to market as a dietary supplement company at that time.[56] The similarities with Sirtris' emphasis on reservatrol were noted at the time.[56] In 2016, Flex Pharma released the consumer product "HotShot" as a dietary supplement for endurance athletes.[58] In October 2016 the company released data from a clinical trial of its lead drug candidate for nocturnal leg cramps FLX-787, in which FLX-787 failed to meet the primary endpoints.[59][60] Westphal stepped down as CEO in June 2017 to return to working at Longwood fulltime; he retained the board chairmanship.[59]
Board positions[edit]
Westphal serves on the Board of Directors of Flex Pharma (Nasdaq FLKS) and the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School, the Board of Overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the board of Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), and he is a member of the Boston Commercial Club.[citation needed]
Media appearances[edit]
Westphal has been featured on 60 Minutes with Morley Safer,[61] CNN’s Vital Signs with Dr. Sanjay Gupta,[62] an ABC News Special hosted by Barbara Walters,[63] and as the subject of a Fortune cover article.[64]

Background and training[edit]
He finished the MD–PhD program at Harvard University in six years.[1]
Career[edit]
He worked at McKinsey & Company for two years after getting his degrees.[1]
From 2000 to 2005 he was a partner at Polaris Venture Partners, a venture capital firm.[2]
Work at Polaris[edit]
In 2001, he worked with Robert Langer and other scientists to found Mimeon based on work by Langer on glycoengineering; the company changed its name to Momenta Pharmaceuticals the next year and went public in 2004.[2][3][4] Westphal was the founding CEO.[4] Momenta brought the first generic, low-molecular-weight heparin to market.[3]
In 2002 he co-founded Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which was built to discover and develop drugs and reagents based on RNA interference based on work done by scientists Phillip Sharp, Paul Schimmel, David Bartel, and Thomas Tuschl; John Maraganore was the founding CEO.[5][6] The company held its IPO in 2004, one of the few biotech companies able to do so in a down market.[7] As of 2016 Alnylam remained the dominant company in the RNAi field.[8][9]
In 2003 he co-founded Acceleron Pharma with scientists Jasbir Seehra, Tom Maniatis, Mark Ptashne, Wylie Vale, and scientific advisor Joan Massague, and John Knopf; Westphal served as founding CEO.[10][11] The company was founded to discover and develop drugs based on the scientific discoveries of the scientific founders in the field of growth factors and transforming growth factors in the fields of metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and muscle-wasting conditions.[12][13] The company went public in September 2013.[14]
In 2004, he co-founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals with Harvard biologist David Sinclair, serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel.[15][16] The company focused on resveratrol formulations and derivatives as activators of the SIRT1 enzyme.[15][15][17] The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of reservatrol.[18] Westphal and Sinclair aggressively marketed investment in the company as an anti-aging opportunity, which was controversial[15][19] but effective; Westphal raised $100 million in 2006.[19] In 2005 Westphal recruited Michelle Dipp to join the team at Sirtris; she would work with him in several subsequent ventures.[20]
Work after Polaris[edit]
In 2006, Westphal worked with Aldrich and Roger Tung to found and get seed funding for Concert Pharmaceuticals based on Tung's ideas about using deuterium to make deuterated drugs.[21] Westphal was not involved in the company by the time it went public in 2014.[22]
Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million.[23] GSK paid $22.50/share, when Sirtris's stock was trading at $12/share, down 45% from its highest price of the previous year.[24] Westphal was made CEO of the subsidiary and appointed Senior Vice President of GSK's Center of Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD) unit. Sirtris' science and claims were controversial; studies published in 2009 and early 2010 by scientists from Amgen and Pfizer cast doubt on whether SIRT1 was directly activated by resveratrol and showed that the apparent activity was actually due to a fluorescent reagent used in the experiments, and were widely discussed.[25][26][27][28]
In 2008, Westphal worked with Dipp, Aldrich, and Alexey Margolin to found Alnara Pharmaceuticals, which was created to develop ways to formulate biopharmaceuticals so they could be taken by mouth, instead of by injection.[20][29] Margolin had been CEO of Altus Therapeutics, which had been developing liprotamase, which it had licensed from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, but ran out of money. Alnara acquired the license and focused its resources on further developing liprotamase; Eli Lilly and Company acquired Alnara in July 2010 on the promise of that data acquired by Alnara.[30] Lilly submitted a new drug application to the FDA in 2011, which the FDA rejected, finding no clear benefit over existing products and requiring an additional clinical trial.[31] Lilly took a $122.6 million write-down on the value of the asset, and then sold it to Anthera Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[31]
In February 2010, Westphal formed a new venture fund called Longwood Founders Fund, together with Aldrich and Dipp.[32][33]
In April 2010, Westphal stepped down as CEO of Sirtris and as Senior VP of GSK's CEEDD and Dipp took over those roles; Westphal took over leadership of GSK's venture unit, SR One.[34][20]
In August 2010, a nonprofit called the Healthy Lifespan Institute, which had been formed the year before by Westphal and Dipp, began selling SRT501 as a dietary supplement online;[18] when this become public GSK required Westphal and Dipp, who were still GSK employees, to resign from the nonprofit.[35][36][37]
GSK/Sirtris terminated development of SRT501 in late 2010.[38][39] In 2013 GSK shut down Sirtris and its development candidates were absorbed into GSK, where research and development continued.[23][40][41]
Also in August 2010, the Longwood team co-founded VeraStem by providing seed funding and office space in its own offices, with Westphal serving as CEO and chairman of the board; Verastem aimed to isolate cancer stem cells and then discover drugs that would selectively kill them.[42][43] He brought the company public in 2012 and stepped down as CEO in 2013, as the company was getting ready to start a clinical trial of its lead product, a drug intended to treat mesothelioma.[43]
In April 2011, Westphal left SR One to focus on Longwood; news reports said that Dipp would soon leave GSK in order to focus on Longwood as well.[44]
In 2011, Westphal, Dipp. and Aldrich co-founded OvaScience with Jonathan Tilly and Sinclair, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian oogonial stem cells and work on mitochondria by Sinclair.[45][46] Tilly's work was controversial, with some groups unable to replicate it.[47][48] The company's claims about its services were controversial from their first announcements.[49] The company's A financing round was $6 million and it raised a $37 million B round in early 2012; Longwood participated in both rounds.[50] OvaScience held its public offering in 2012, and part of its pitch to investors was that its services would probably not be regulated by the FDA so it would probably be able to start generating significant revenue in the US by the end of 2013, but in 2013 the FDA ruled that it would need to file an investigational new drug application before it could start marketing the service; OvaScience's shares fell 40% in response.[51] By September 2016 OvaScience had raised and spent around $228 million.[52] In early December its shares were trading at around $3; in mid-December 2016 the company's shares fell around 50% when it announced layoffs and the departure of its CEO and chief operating officer in the face of sales continuing to fall below expectations.[53]
In 2014, he co-founded Flex Pharma with Jennifer Cermak (from Sirtris) based on work by scientific co-founders Roderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University and Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School.[54] MacKinnon and Bean invented a dietary supplement for treating and preventing muscle cramps in athletes that contained ginger extract, cinnamon extract and capsicum, and tested it in clinical trials.[55][56] In 2014 the company described itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders, pursuing treatments muscle cramping across a range of conditions including multiple sclerosis, ALS, and cramping in athletes, based on MacKinnon's Nobel Prize winning work on ion channels, and raised a $40 million Series A round.[54][57] The company had a $86 million initial public offering in 2015 and revealed the dietary supplement product and its intent to go to market as a dietary supplement company at that time.[56] The similarities with Sirtris' emphasis on reservatrol were noted at the time.[56] In 2016, Flex Pharma released the consumer product "HotShot" as a dietary supplement for endurance athletes.[58] In October 2016 the company released data from a clinical trial of its lead drug candidate for nocturnal leg cramps FLX-787, in which FLX-787 failed to meet the primary endpoints.[59][60] Westphal stepped down as CEO in June 2017 to return to working at Longwood fulltime; he retained the board chairmanship.[59]
Board positions[edit]
Westphal serves on the Board of Directors of Flex Pharma (Nasdaq FLKS) and the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School, the Board of Overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the board of Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), and he is a member of the Boston Commercial Club.[citation needed]
Media appearances[edit]
Westphal has been featured on 60 Minutes with Morley Safer,[61] CNN’s Vital Signs with Dr. Sanjay Gupta,[62] an ABC News Special hosted by Barbara Walters,[63] and as the subject of a Fortune cover article.[64]

Background and training[edit]
He finished the MD–PhD program at Harvard University in six years.[1]
Career[edit]
He worked at McKinsey & Company for two years after getting his degrees.[1]
From 2000 to 2005 he was a partner at Polaris Venture Partners, a venture capital firm.[2]
Work at Polaris[edit]
In 2001, he worked with Robert Langer and other scientists to found Mimeon based on work by Langer on glycoengineering; the company changed its name to Momenta Pharmaceuticals the next year and went public in 2004.[2][3][4] Westphal was the founding CEO.[4] Momenta brought the first generic, low-molecular-weight heparin to market.[3]
In 2002 he co-founded Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, which was built to discover and develop drugs and reagents based on RNA interference based on work done by scientists Phillip Sharp, Paul Schimmel, David Bartel, and Thomas Tuschl; John Maraganore was the founding CEO.[5][6] The company held its IPO in 2004, one of the few biotech companies able to do so in a down market.[7] As of 2016 Alnylam remained the dominant company in the RNAi field.[8][9]
In 2003 he co-founded Acceleron Pharma with scientists Jasbir Seehra, Tom Maniatis, Mark Ptashne, Wylie Vale, and scientific advisor Joan Massague, and John Knopf; Westphal served as founding CEO.[10][11] The company was founded to discover and develop drugs based on the scientific discoveries of the scientific founders in the field of growth factors and transforming growth factors in the fields of metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, and muscle-wasting conditions.[12][13] The company went public in September 2013.[14]
In 2004, he co-founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals with Harvard biologist David Sinclair, serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel.[15][16] The company focused on resveratrol formulations and derivatives as activators of the SIRT1 enzyme.[15][15][17] The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of reservatrol.[18] Westphal and Sinclair aggressively marketed investment in the company as an anti-aging opportunity, which was controversial[15][19] but effective; Westphal raised $100 million in 2006.[19] In 2005 Westphal recruited Michelle Dipp to join the team at Sirtris; she would work with him in several subsequent ventures.[20]
Work after Polaris[edit]
In 2006, Westphal worked with Aldrich and Roger Tung to found and get seed funding for Concert Pharmaceuticals based on Tung's ideas about using deuterium to make deuterated drugs.[21] Westphal was not involved in the company by the time it went public in 2014.[22]
Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million.[23] GSK paid $22.50/share, when Sirtris's stock was trading at $12/share, down 45% from its highest price of the previous year.[24] Westphal was made CEO of the subsidiary and appointed Senior Vice President of GSK's Center of Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD) unit. Sirtris' science and claims were controversial; studies published in 2009 and early 2010 by scientists from Amgen and Pfizer cast doubt on whether SIRT1 was directly activated by resveratrol and showed that the apparent activity was actually due to a fluorescent reagent used in the experiments, and were widely discussed.[25][26][27][28]
In 2008, Westphal worked with Dipp, Aldrich, and Alexey Margolin to found Alnara Pharmaceuticals, which was created to develop ways to formulate biopharmaceuticals so they could be taken by mouth, instead of by injection.[20][29] Margolin had been CEO of Altus Therapeutics, which had been developing liprotamase, which it had licensed from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, but ran out of money. Alnara acquired the license and focused its resources on further developing liprotamase; Eli Lilly and Company acquired Alnara in July 2010 on the promise of that data acquired by Alnara.[30] Lilly submitted a new drug application to the FDA in 2011, which the FDA rejected, finding no clear benefit over existing products and requiring an additional clinical trial.[31] Lilly took a $122.6 million write-down on the value of the asset, and then sold it to Anthera Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[31]
In February 2010, Westphal formed a new venture fund called Longwood Founders Fund, together with Aldrich and Dipp.[32][33]
In April 2010, Westphal stepped down as CEO of Sirtris and as Senior VP of GSK's CEEDD and Dipp took over those roles; Westphal took over leadership of GSK's venture unit, SR One.[34][20]
In August 2010, a nonprofit called the Healthy Lifespan Institute, which had been formed the year before by Westphal and Dipp, began selling SRT501 as a dietary supplement online;[18] when this become public GSK required Westphal and Dipp, who were still GSK employees, to resign from the nonprofit.[35][36][37]
GSK/Sirtris terminated development of SRT501 in late 2010.[38][39] In 2013 GSK shut down Sirtris and its development candidates were absorbed into GSK, where research and development continued.[23][40][41]
Also in August 2010, the Longwood team co-founded VeraStem by providing seed funding and office space in its own offices, with Westphal serving as CEO and chairman of the board; Verastem aimed to isolate cancer stem cells and then discover drugs that would selectively kill them.[42][43] He brought the company public in 2012 and stepped down as CEO in 2013, as the company was getting ready to start a clinical trial of its lead product, a drug intended to treat mesothelioma.[43]
In April 2011, Westphal left SR One to focus on Longwood; news reports said that Dipp would soon leave GSK in order to focus on Longwood as well.[44]
In 2011, Westphal, Dipp. and Aldrich co-founded OvaScience with Jonathan Tilly and Sinclair, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian oogonial stem cells and work on mitochondria by Sinclair.[45][46] Tilly's work was controversial, with some groups unable to replicate it.[47][48] The company's claims about its services were controversial from their first announcements.[49] The company's A financing round was $6 million and it raised a $37 million B round in early 2012; Longwood participated in both rounds.[50] OvaScience held its public offering in 2012, and part of its pitch to investors was that its services would probably not be regulated by the FDA so it would probably be able to start generating significant revenue in the US by the end of 2013, but in 2013 the FDA ruled that it would need to file an investigational new drug application before it could start marketing the service; OvaScience's shares fell 40% in response.[51] By September 2016 OvaScience had raised and spent around $228 million.[52] In early December its shares were trading at around $3; in mid-December 2016 the company's shares fell around 50% when it announced layoffs and the departure of its CEO and chief operating officer in the face of sales continuing to fall below expectations.[53]
In 2014, he co-founded Flex Pharma with Jennifer Cermak (from Sirtris) based on work by scientific co-founders Roderick MacKinnon of Rockefeller University and Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School.[54] MacKinnon and Bean invented a dietary supplement for treating and preventing muscle cramps in athletes that contained ginger extract, cinnamon extract and capsicum, and tested it in clinical trials.[55][56] In 2014 the company described itself as a developer of drugs for neuromuscular disorders, pursuing treatments muscle cramping across a range of conditions including multiple sclerosis, ALS, and cramping in athletes, based on MacKinnon's Nobel Prize winning work on ion channels, and raised a $40 million Series A round.[54][57] The company had a $86 million initial public offering in 2015 and revealed the dietary supplement product and its intent to go to market as a dietary supplement company at that time.[56] The similarities with Sirtris' emphasis on reservatrol were noted at the time.[56] In 2016, Flex Pharma released the consumer product "HotShot" as a dietary supplement for endurance athletes.[58] In October 2016 the company released data from a clinical trial of its lead drug candidate for nocturnal leg cramps FLX-787, in which FLX-787 failed to meet the primary endpoints.[59][60] Westphal stepped down as CEO in June 2017 to return to working at Longwood fulltime; he retained the board chairmanship.[59]
Board positions[edit]
Westphal serves on the Board of Directors of Flex Pharma (Nasdaq FLKS) and the Board of Fellows of Harvard Medical School, the Board of Overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the board of Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), and he is a member of the Boston Commercial Club.[citation needed]
Media appearances[edit]
Westphal has been featured on 60 Minutes with Morley Safer,[61] CNN’s Vital Signs with Dr. Sanjay Gupta,[62] an ABC News Special hosted by Barbara Walters,[63] and as the subject of a Fortune cover article.[64]

Following the positive results of our extract formulation in our electrically induced cramp model, we analyzed the extract formulation and identified two compounds, FLX-787 and FLX-788, as the likely active components of the extract formulation, both of which activate the TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion channels. We then tested the safety and efficacy of FLX-787 and FLX-788 using our electrically induced cramp model.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
