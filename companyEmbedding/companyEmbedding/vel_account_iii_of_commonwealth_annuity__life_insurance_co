AMENDED AND RESTATED PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT
Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance Products Trust
 Franklin/Templeton Distributors, Inc.
 Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company

Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance Products Trust (the "Trust"),   
Franklin/Templeton Distributors, Inc. (the "Underwriter," and together with the 
Trust, "we" or "us"), Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (the      
"Company" or "you"), on your behalf and on behalf of certain Accounts, have     
previously entered into a Participation Agreement dated September 25, 2006 (the 
"Agreement"). The parties now desire to amend the Agreement by this amendment   
(the "Amendment").                                                              

    Except as modified hereby, all other terms and conditions of the Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms    
defined in the Agreement shall have the same meaning in this Amendment.         

 AMENDMENT

For good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby   
acknowledged, the parties agree to amend the Agreement as follows:              

1.   Section 1 and Section 2.2.1 are hereby each amended to reflect that        
Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance Products Trust (the "Trust") is 
 organized as a statutory trust under the laws of the State of Delaware.

2.   Section 3.1.3 is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:          

 "3.1.3 We agree that shares of the Trust will be sold only to: (i) life
   insurance companies which have entered into fund participation agreements
 with the Trust ("Participating Insurance Companies") and their separate
  accounts or to qualified pension and retirement plans in accordance with
     the terms of the Shared Funding Order; and (ii) investment companies in the
form of funds of funds. No shares of any Portfolio will be sold to the
general public."                                                      

3.   Section 5.2 is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:            

  "5.2 If and to the extent required by law, you shall: (i) solicit voting
     instructions from Contract owners; (ii) vote the Trust shares in accordance
   with the instructions received from Contract owners; and (iii) vote Trust
  shares owned by subaccounts for which no instructions have been received
from Contract owners in the same proportion as Trust shares of such   
   Portfolio for which instructions have been received from Contract owners;
   so long as and to the extent that the SEC continues to interpret the 1940
     Act to require pass-through voting privileges for variable contract owners.
    You reserve the right to vote Trust shares held in any Account in your own
right, to the extent permitted by law."

4.   Schedules B, C and D of the Agreement are deleted and replaced in their    
entirety with the Schedules B, C and D attached hereto, respectively. 

5.   All other terms and provisions of the Agreement not amended herein shall   
remain in full force and effect.                                      

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused its duly authorized officers 
to execute this Amendment effective as of June 5, 2007.

Applicants' Representations
1. Commonwealth is a life insurance company engaged in the business of writing individual and group annuity contracts and life insurance policies. Commonwealth was originally organized under the laws of Delaware in July 1974 and was subsequently re-domiciled in the state of Massachusetts effective December 31, 2002.
2. Prior to December 30, 2005, Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Annuity Company) was an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group (“THG”), formerly Allmerica Financial Corporation. On that date, THG completed the closing of the sale of Commonwealth to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Goldman Sachs”). Effective September 1, 2006, Commonwealth changed its name from Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Start Printed Page 20666Annuity Company to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs completed the transfer of the common stock of Commonwealth to Global Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited. Effective January 2, 2014, Forethought Services LLC acquired ownership of 79% of the shares of Commonwealth. Forethought Services LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forethought Financial Group, Inc., which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin) Company. As of December 31, 2015, Goldman Sachs owns a total of approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of Global Atlantic; and other investors, none of whom own more than 9.9%, own the remaining 78% of the outstanding ordinary shares.
3. Each of the Separate Accounts meets the definition of “separate account,” as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act and Rule 0-1(e) thereunder. The Separate Accounts are registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The assets of the Separate Accounts support the Contracts and interests in the Separate Accounts offered through such Contracts. Commonwealth is the legal owner of the assets in the Separate Accounts. The Separate Accounts are segmented into subaccounts, and each subaccount invests in an underlying registered open-end management investment company or a series thereof. A subaccount of one or more of the Separate Accounts corresponds to each of the Existing Portfolios. The business and affairs of the Separate Accounts, as unit investment trusts, are conducted by Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.
4. The Contracts are each registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable. Each of the Contracts has particular fees, charges, and investment options, as described in the Contracts' respective registration statements.
5. The Contracts are individual or group deferred variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance policies. As set forth in the prospectuses for the Contracts, Commonwealth reserves the right to substitute shares of another registered investment company for the shares of any registered investment company already purchased or to be purchased in the future by the Separate Accounts.
6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolios for shares of the Existing Portfolios (“Substitutions”):

7. The Replacement Portfolios are all series of the Trust. The Trust is an insurance-dedicated Delaware statutory trust that was organized on June 17, 2013. The Trust is registered with the Commission as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-22865) and its shares are registered under the 1933 Act (File No. 333-189870). The Trust is a series investment company and currently has 30 separate portfolios (each, a “Global Atlantic Fund,” and collectively, the “Global Atlantic Funds”). The following 13 Global Atlantic Funds comprise the Replacement Portfolios: Global Atlantic BlackRock Allocation Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock International Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Small Cap Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock U.S. Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Value Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock High Yield Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Core Fixed Income Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Global Equity Insights Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Large Cap Growth Insights Portfolio, and Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value Insights Portfolio.
8. Global Atlantic, an Indiana limited liability company and a registered investment adviser, serves as investment adviser for each of the Global Atlantic Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Global Atlantic Fund, and Global Atlantic.
9. Each Replacement Portfolio is sub-advised by BlackRock Investment Management, LLC (“BlackRock”) or Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”). BlackRock is a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock is a registered investment adviser and a commodity pool operator organized in Princeton, New Jersey. BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates had approximately $4.64 trillion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015. BlackRock is located at 1 University Square, Princeton, NJ 08536. GSAM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. As of December 31, 2015, GSAM, including its investment advisory affiliates, had assets under supervision of approximately $1.08 trillion. GSAM's principal offices are located at 200 West Street, New York, NY 20182.
10. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Portfolios have investment objectives, principal investment strategies, and principle risks, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially similar to, the corresponding Existing Portfolios to make those Replacement Portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes.
11. Information for each Existing Portfolio and Replacement Portfolio, including investment objectives, principal investment strategies, principal risks, and comparative performance history, can be found in the application.
12. Applicants state that in selecting the Replacement Portfolios, Commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and maintaining a high-quality menu of investment options that would offer a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed Substitutions as is currently available under the Contracts. Contract owners with Contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the Existing Portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed Substitutions as before the proposed Substitutions. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Replacement Portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding Existing Portfolio. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of each Existing Portfolio and its corresponding Replacement Portfolio in greater detail.
13. Applicants represent that as of the Substitution Date (defined below), the Separate Accounts will redeem shares of the Existing Portfolios for cash or in-kind. Redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that Contract values will remain fully invested at all times.
14. Each Substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.[2] 

15. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way. Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution. In addition, the Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
16. The Section 26 Applicants agree that, for a period of two years following the implementation of the proposed Substitution (the “Substitution Date”), and for those Contracts with assets allocated to the Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Start Printed Page 20669Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the most recently filed application. Commonwealth will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.
17. From the date the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) through 30 days following the Substitution Date, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in an Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution) to any other available subaccount under the Contract without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Further, on the Substitution Date, Contract values attributable to investments in each Existing Portfolio will be transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio without charge and without being subject to any transfer limitations. Moreover, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
18. At least 30 days prior to the Substitution Date, Contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the Section 26 Applicants received or expect to receive Commission approval of the applicable proposed Substitutions and of the anticipated Substitution Date (the “Pre-Substitution Notice”). Pre-Substitution Notices sent to Contract owners will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 497 under the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution Notice will advise Contract owners that from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice through the date 30 days after the Substitutions, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccounts investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Among other information, the notice will inform affected Contract owners that that, except as described in the disruptive transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, through at least 30 days after the Substitution Date. Additionally, all affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable Replacement Portfolios at least 30 days before the Substitution Date.
19. In addition to the Supplements distributed to the Contract owners, within five business days after the Substitution Date, Contract owners whose assets are allocated to a Replacement Portfolio as part of the proposed Substitutions will be sent a written notice (each, a “Confirmation”) informing them that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified. The Confirmation also will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice. The Confirmation will also reflect the values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
Legal Analysis
1. The Section 26 Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the Commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the 1940 Act.
2. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the Substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that Congress intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include this provision. Applicants state that each Substitution protects the Contract owners who have Contract value allocated to an Existing Portfolio by providing Replacement Portfolios with substantially similar investment objectives, strategies, and risks, and providing Contract owners with investment options that would have total and net annual operating expense ratios that are lower than, or equal to, their corresponding investment options before the Substitutions.
3. Commonwealth has reserved the right under the Contracts to substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current funds offered as an investment option under the Contracts. The Contracts and the Contracts' prospectuses disclose this right.
4. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the proposed Substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the investment line-ups that are available to Contract owners while reducing expenses and continuing to provide Contract owners with a wide array of investment options. The Section 26 Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options and the proposed Substitutions also will permit Commonwealth to present information to its Contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner. The Section 26 Applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed Substitutions, Contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under the Contracts. The Section 26 Applicants also assert that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that Section 26 was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly forced redemption, nor will they affect other aspects of the Contracts. In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not adversely affect any features or riders under the Contracts because none of the features or riders have any investment restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of any proposed Substitution. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect and deter disruptive transfer and other “market timing” activity) that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice (which supplement will be delivered to the Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date. The proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that the Substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts.
5. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit the Section 17 Applicants to carry out some or all of the proposed Substitutions. The Section 17 Start Printed Page 20670Applicants state that because the proposed Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and purchases, the proposed Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons.
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company.
7. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing Portfolios to the Separate Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the Separate Accounts would purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Portfolios. Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants provide that to the extent Commonwealth and the Existing Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act, it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed Substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a). Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants have determined to seek relief from Section 17(a).
8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolios by the Separate Accounts, including the consideration to be paid and received, as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind transactions, including the considered to be paid to each Existing Portfolio and received by each Replacement Portfolio involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contract held by the affected Contract owners. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though the Separate Accounts, Commonwealth and the Trust may not rely on Rule 17a-7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons.
9. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of the Trust and the Replacement Portfolios, as provided in the Trust's registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
Applicants' Conditions
The Section 26 Applicants, and Global Atlantic as applicable, agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The Substitutions will not be effected unless Commonwealth determines that: (i) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by the application; (ii) the Substitutions can be consummated as described in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (iii) any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. After the Substitution Date, Global Atlantic will not change a sub-adviser, add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order (as defined in the application), or any replacement order from the Commission, with respect to any Replacement Portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in sub-adviser, the new sub-adviser, or the Replacement Portfolio's ability to rely on the Manager of Managers Order, or any replacement order from the Commission.
3. Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution.
4. The Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.
5. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
6. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way.
7. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in the Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution Date) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution Date) to any other available investment option under the Contract without charge for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date. Except as described in any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
8. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days before the Substitution Date about: (i) The intended Substitution of Existing Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios; (ii) the intended Substitution Date; and (iii) information with respect to transfers as set forth in Condition 7 Start Printed Page 20671above. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to affected Contract owners, at least thirty days before the Substitution Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio.
9. The Section 26 Applicants will deliver to each affected Contract owner within five business days of the Substitution Date a written confirmation which will include: (i) A confirmation that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (ii) a restatement of the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice; and (iii) values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
10. For a period of two years following the Substitution Date, for Contract owners who were Contract owners as of the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the application. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.

2.
     The Section 26 Applicants state that, because the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants also state that what effect the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the relative future performance of the Existing Portfolios and Replacement Portfolios, which the Section 26 Applicants cannot predict. Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.

 SUMMARY OF RISKS AND BENEFITS

This Summary is intended to provide only a very brief overview of the more      
significant aspects of the Policy. The remainder of this Prospectus offers a    
more complete presentation of the topics presented here, and will help you      
better understand the product. However, the Policy, together with its attached  
application, constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company.      

The Policy is a life insurance contract with death benefits, Policy Value, and  
other features traditionally associated with life insurance. The Policy is      
"variable" because the Policy Value will increase or decrease depending on the  
investment experience of the Sub-Accounts of the Separate Account. Under some   
circumstances, the Death Benefit may vary with the investment experience of the 
Sub-Accounts.                                                                   

Unlike traditional insurance policies, the Policy has no fixed schedule for     
payments. Within limits, you may make payments of any amount and frequency.     
While you may establish a schedule of payments ("planned payments"), the Policy 
will not necessarily lapse if you fail to make planned payments, and making     
planned payments will not guarantee that the Policy will remain in force.       

WHAT ARE THE POLICY'S BENEFITS?                                                 

While the Policy is in force, it will provide:                                  

-    Life insurance coverage on the named Insured                     

-    Policy Value                                                     

-    Surrender rights and partial withdrawal rights                   

-    Loan privileges                                                  

Other benefits previously available through the policy included:                

    -    Waiver of Premium Rider - This Rider provides that, during periods of
        total disability, continuing more than four months, the Company will
       add to the Policy Value each month an amount selected by you or the
       amount needed to pay the Policy charges, whichever is greater. This
   value will be used to keep the Policy in force. This benefit is
         subject to the Company's maximum issue benefits. Its cost will change
yearly.                                                     

   -    Guaranteed Insurability Rider - This rider guarantees that insurance
          may be added at various option dates without Evidence of Insurability.
         This benefit may be exercised on the option dates even if the Insured
is disabled.                                                

     -    Other Insured Rider - This Rider provides a term insurance benefit for
          up to five Insureds. At present this benefit is only available for the
    spouse and children of the primary Insured. The Rider includes a
        feature that allows the "Other Insured" to convert the coverage to a
flexible premium adjustable life insurance Policy.          

     -    Children's Insurance Rider - This rider provides coverage for eligible
     minor children. It also covers future children, including adopted
children and stepchildren.                                  

     -    Accidental Death Benefit Rider - This Rider pays an additional benefit
   for death resulting from a covered accident prior to the Policy
anniversary nearest the Insured's Age 70.                   

 -    Exchange Option Rider - This Rider allows you to use the Policy to
insure a different person, subject to Company guidelines.   

4 

P-->485APOS6th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
   -    Living Benefits Rider - a This Rider permits part of the proceeds of
  the Policy to be available before death if the Insured becomes
terminally ill or is permanently confined to a nursing home.

   -    Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider - This Rider, WHICH IS AVAILABLE ONLY
   AT DATE OF ISSUE, (a) guarantees that the Policy will not lapse
  regardless of the performance of the Separate Account, and (b)
provides a guaranteed net death benefit.                    

WHAT ARE THE POLICY'S RISKS?                                                    

There are certain risks associated with the Policy:                             

 -    There is no guaranteed minimum Policy Value. The value of a Policy
will vary up or down to reflect the investment experience of
          allocations to the Sub-Accounts and the fixed rates of interest earned
        by allocations to the General Account. The Policy Value will also be
        adjusted for other factors, including the amount of charges imposed.
      The Policy will terminate if Policy Value is insufficient to cover
         certain monthly charges plus loan interest accrued, or if Outstanding
          Loans exceed the Policy Value less surrender charges. The Policies are
unsuitable as short-term savings vehicles.                  

     -    The Policy Value may decrease to the point where the Policy will lapse
   and provide no further death benefit without additional premium
        payments, unless the optional Guaranteed Death Benefit is in effect.
    The Guaranteed Death Benefit may not be available in all states.

    -    Taking a loan from your Policy may increase the risk that your Policy
      will lapse, will have a permanent effect on your Policy Value, and
   will reduce the Death Benefit. In addition, if your Policy is a
          modified endowment contract for tax purposes, taking a Policy loan may
have tax consequences.                                      

-    Surrender of the Policy may be subject to a substantial surrender
         charge. Partial Withdrawals may be subject to surrender charges and a
Partial Withdrawal Charge.                                  

  -    A Policy may be considered a "modified endowment contract" if total
          payments during the first seven Policy years (or within seven years of
        a material change in the Policy) exceed the total net level payments
     payable, if the Policy had provided paid-up future benefits after
       seven level annual payments. If the Policy is considered a modified
          endowment contract, all distributions (including Policy loans, partial
withdrawals, surrenders and assignments) will be taxed on an
          "income-first" basis. In addition, a 10% additional penalty tax may be
        imposed on that part of a distribution that is includible in income.

  -    Each Fund is subject to investment risks and other risks. We do not
         promise that the Funds will meet their investment objectives. Amounts
         that you have allocated to Sub-Accounts may grow in value, decline in
    value, or grow less than you expect, depending on the investment
          performance of the Funds in which those Sub-Accounts invest. Your bear
     the investment risk that those Funds possibly will not meet their
  investment objectives. A description of each Fund's investment
         policies and a comprehensive discussion of the risks of each Fund may
by found in the Fund's prospectus.

(1) SURRENDER CHARGES - At any time that the Policy is in effect, a Policyowner 
may elect to surrender the Policy and receive its Surrender Value. A surrender  
charge is calculated upon issuance of the Policy and upon each increase in Face 
Amount. The duration of the surrender charge is 15 years for issue Ages 0       
through 50, grading down to 10 years for issue Ages 55 and above. The surrender 
charge is imposed only if, during its duration, you request a full surrender or 
a decrease in the Face Amount. The maximum surrender charge calculated upon     
issuance of the Policy is equal to the sum of (a) plus (b), where (a) is a      
DEFERRED ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE, and (b) is a DEFERRED SALES CHARGE.             

The DEFERRED ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE is $8.50 per thousand dollars of the initial 
Face Amount or of an increase in the Face Amount. The charge is designed to     
reimburse the Company for administrative costs associated with product research 
and development, underwriting, Policy administration, decreasing the Face       
Amount, and surrendering a Policy. Because the maximum surrender charge reduces 
by 0.5% or more per month (depending on issue Age) after the 40th Policy month  
from the Date of Issue or the effective date of an increase in the Face Amount, 
in certain situations some or all of the deferred administrative charge may not 
be assessed upon surrender of the Policy.                                       

The DEFERRED SALES CHARGE is equal to 49% of premiums received up to a maximum  
number of Guideline Annual Premiums that vary by issue Age. This maximum number 
varies from 1.660714 (for Ages 0 through 55) to 0.948980 (for Age 85). In       
accordance with state insurance regulations, the amount of the maximum surrender
charge will not exceed a specified amount per $1,000 of the initial Face Amount.
The deferred sales charge varies based on individual characteristics (sexes,    
issue ages and underwriting classes) of the Insureds. Considering all possible  
combinations of sexes, issue ages and underwriting classes of the Insureds, the 
minimum is $7.68 (for a Female Standard Smoker Age 0) and the maximum is $38.25 
(for a Male Standard Smoker Age 53) per $1000 of Face Amount.                   

The surrender charge shown in the table may not be representative of the charge 
you would pay. For more information about the surrender charge that would apply 
to your Policy, please contact us at the address or telephone number shown on   
the front cover of this Prospectus or contact your agent.                       

(2) PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS - The Company will reduce the amount of the Policy's    
outstanding Surrender Charge by the amount of the Partial Withdrawal Charge. If 
no Surrender Charges apply to the Policy at the time of a withdrawal, no partial
withdrawal charge will apply to that withdrawal.                                

(3) PROVIDING A PROJECTION OF VALUES - You may request a free personalized      
illustration of death benefits, cash surrender values and cash values once      
annually. The Company may in its discretion provide additional personalized     
illustrations upon request. We currently do not charge for personal             
illustrations, but we reserve the right to charge a fee, not to exceed $25, if  
you request more than one illustration annually.

(1) COST OF INSURANCE - Charges vary based on individual characteristics such as
the age, Policy year, underwriting class, Face Amount and sex of the Insured. We
determine the current cost of insurance rates, but we guarantee that we will    
never charge you a higher cost of insurance rate that the guaranteed rate shown 
in your Policy. We calculate a separate cost of insurance rate for any increase 
in the Face Amount based on the Insured's circumstances at the time of the      
increase. The charges shown in the table may not be representative of the charge
that a particular Policy owner will pay. You may obtain more information about  
the particular charges that apply to you by contacting us at the address or     
telephone number shown on the back cover of this Prospectus or contact your     
agent. For more information about the calculation of the cost of insurance      
charges, see CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS.                                            

Considering all possible combinations of sexes, issue ages and underwriting     
classes of the Insureds, per $1,000 of original Face Amount: the minimum Cost of
Insurance Charge is $0.02 (for Female Preferred Non-Smoker Age 25) and the      
maximum is $83.33 (for a Male Sub-Standard Smoker Rated 500% & $5 Permanent Flat
Extra Age 94).                                                                  

(2) MONTHLY CHARGES FOR OPTIONAL BENEFITS - The charges for these benefits vary 
depending upon the optional benefits selected, and by the individual            
characteristics of the Insureds. The charges shown in the table may not be

 THE COMPANY, THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT AND THE FUNDS
WHO IS THE COMPANY?                                                             

Effective September 1, 2006, Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Annuity     
Company was renamed Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company and the     
principal office was relocated to 132 Turnpike Road, Southborough, MA 01772,    
telephone 508-460-22400. Unless otherwise specified, any reference to the       
"Company" refers to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company             
("Commonwealth Annuity ").                                                      

Commonwealth Annuity is a life insurance company organized under the laws of    
Delaware in July 1974. Prior to December 31, 2002, Commonwealth Annuity was a   
direct subsidiary of First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company, which in 
turn was a direct subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group ("THG," formerly    
Allmerica Financial Corporation). Effective December 31, 2002, Commonwealth     
Annuity became a Massachusetts domiciled insurance company and a direct         
subsidiary of THG. On December 30, 2005, THG completed the closing of the sale  
of the Company to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ("Goldman Sachs"), 85 Broad     
Street, New York, NY 10004.                                                     

As of December 31, 2006, Commonwealth Annuity had over $[XX] billion in         
assets and over $[XX] billion of life insurance in force.                       

Commonwealth Annuity is subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
governing insurance companies and to regulation by the Commissioner of Insurance
of Massachusetts. In addition, it is subject to the insurance laws and          
regulations of other states and jurisdictions in which it is licensed to        
operate.                                                                        

WHAT IS THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT?                                                   

In this prospectus, "Separate Account" refers to the VEL II Account of          
Commonwealth Annuity. The Separate Account is a separate investment account     
compromised of Sub-Accounts. Each Sub-Account invests in a corresponding        
investment portfolio ("Fund") of a management investment company. The assets    
used to fund the variable portion of the Policy are set aside in the Separate   
Account, and are kept separate from the general assets of the Company. Under    
Massachusetts law, assets equal to the reserves and other liabilities of the    
Separate Account may not be charged with any liabilities arising out of any     
other business of the Company. Each Sub-Account is administered and accounted   
for as part of the general business of the Company, but the income, capital     
gains, or capital losses of each Sub-Account are allocated to such Sub-Account, 
without regard to other income, capital gains or capital losses of the Company, 
or the other Sub-Accounts. The Company is obligated to pay all amounts promised 
under the Policies.                                                             

The Company reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to   
change the names of the Separate Account and the Sub-Accounts. The Company may  
also offer other variable life insurance policies investing in the Separate     
Account, which are not discussed in this Prospectus. In addition the Separate   
Account may invest in other underlying funds that are not available to the      
Policies described in this prospectus.                                          

WHAT ARE THE FUNDS?                                                             

Each Sub-Account invests in a corresponding investment portfolio ("Fund") of an 
open-end management investment company. The Funds available through this policy 
are NOT publicly traded. They are only available as variable investment options 
in variable life insurance policies or variable annuity contracts issued by life
insurance companies or, in some cases, through participation in certain         
qualified pension or retirement plans. The investment advisers of the Funds may 
manage publicly traded mutual funds with similar names and objectives. However, 
the Funds are NOT directly related to any publicly traded mutual fund.          
Consequently, the investment performance of the Funds and any similarly named   
publicly traded mutual fund may differ substantially.

A summary of investment objectives of each of the Funds is set forth below.     
Certain Funds have similar investment objectives and/or policies. Therefore, to 
choose the Sub-Accounts which best meet your needs and objectives, carefully    
read the prospectuses of the Funds, along with this Prospectus. There can be no 
assurance that the investment objectives of the Underlying Funds can be achieved
or that the value of the Policy will equal or exceed the aggregate amount of the
purchase payments made under the Policy. Sub-Account values will fluctuate; even
a Sub-Account investing in a money market fund may have negative returns,       
particularly if fees and charges are deducted at the Sub-Account level. In some 
states, insurance regulations may restrict the availability of particular Funds.

MORE DETAILED INFORMATION REGARDING THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RESTRICTIONS AND 
RISKS, EXPENSES PAID BY THE FUNDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE  
FUNDS MAY BE FOUND IN THEIR RESPECTIVE PROSPECTUSES, WHICH SHOULD BE READ

THE POLICY

As of the date of this Prospectus, the Company has effectively ceased issuing   
new Policies, except in connection with certain pre-existing contractual plans  
and programs. This Prospectus provides only a very brief overview of the more   
significant aspects of the Policy and of the Company's administrative procedures
for the benefit of the Company's current Policyowners. The Policy together with 
its attached application constitutes the entire agreement between you and the   
Company.                                                                        

HOW DO I COMMUNICATE WITH THE COMPANY?                                          

You may contacting us at the address or telephone number shown on the back cover
of this Prospectus or by contacting your agent.                                 

EFFECTIVE DATE OF TRANSACTIONS                                                  

Once your Policy is in force, the effective date of payments, forms and requests
you send is usually determined by the day and time we receive the item in good  
order at the mailing address that appears in this Prospectus. "Good order" means
that we have received all information, letters, forms or other documents,       
completed to our satisfaction, which we believe are necessary to process the    
transaction. Premium payments, loan requests, transfer requests, loan payments  
or withdrawal or surrender requests that we receive in good order before the    
close of business (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, or the close of the New York 
Stock Exchange, if earlier) on a business day will normally be effective as of  
the end of that day, unless the transaction is scheduled to occur on another    
business day. If we receive your payment or request after the close of business 
on a business day, your payment or request will be effective as of the end of   
the next business day. If a scheduled transaction falls on a day that is not a  
business day, we'll process it as of the end of the next business day.          

Other forms, notices and requests are normally effective on the day that we     
receive them in good order, unless the transaction is scheduled to occur on     
another business day. Assignments, change of owner and change of beneficiary    
forms are effective as of the day you sign the assignment or form, once we      
receive them in good order.                                                     

WRITTEN REQUESTS 

Whenever this Prospectus refers to a communication as a "written request," it   
means in writing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to us, and      
received at the mailing address indicated on the front cover of this Prospectus.
We will process the transaction when the written request is received in good    
order. For some transactions, including assignments, loans, withdrawals, and    
surrender of the Policy, we require you to use Company forms. You may obtain    
Company forms by calling 1-800-533-7881. You may also obtain Company forms at   
our Company web site: https://cwannuity.se2.com.                                

TELEPHONE REQUESTS                                                              

You have the privilege to make telephone requests. The Company and our agents   
and affiliates will not be responsible for losses resulting from acting upon    
telephone requests reasonably believed to be genuine. We will employ reasonable 
procedures to confirm that instructions communicated by telephone are genuine;  
otherwise, we may be liable for any losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent    
instructions. Such procedures may include, among others things, requiring some  
form of personal identification prior to acting upon instructions received by   
telephone. All transfer instructions by telephone are tape recorded.            

We cannot guarantee that you will always be able to reach us to complete a      
telephone transaction. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the        
privilege to make requests by telephone at any time without prior notice. Under 
these circumstances, you should submit your request in writing or other form    
acceptable to us.                                                               

HOW DO I APPLY FOR A POLICY?                                                    

The Company is not currently issuing new Policies. The following is provided as 
general information concerning the Company's procedures for issuing policies.   

17

P-->485APOS19th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�19th
Upon receipt at its Service Office of a completed application from a prospective
Policyowner, the Company will follow certain insurance underwriting procedures  
designed to determine whether the proposed Insured is insurable. This process   
may involve medical examinations, and may require that further information be   
provided by the proposed Policyowner before a determination of insurability can 
be made. The Company reserves the right to reject an application which does not 
meet its underwriting guidelines, but in underwriting insurance, the Company    
complies with all applicable federal and state prohibitions concerning unfair   
discrimination. If the application is approved and the Policy is issued and     
accepted by you, the initial premium held in the General Account will be        
credited with interest at a specified rate, beginning not later than the date of
receipt of the premium at the Service Office. IF A POLICY IS NOT ISSUED, THE    
PREMIUMS WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU WITHOUT INTEREST.                              

It is possible to obtain life insurance protection during the underwriting      
process through a Conditional Insurance Agreement. If at the time of application
you make a payment equal to at least one minimum monthly payment for the Policy 
as applied for, the Company will provide conditional insurance, subject to the  
terms of the Conditional Insurance Agreement. This coverage generally will      
continue for a maximum of 90 days from the date of the application or the       
completion of a medical exam, should one be required. In no event will any      
insurance proceeds be paid under the Conditional Insurance Agreement if death is
by suicide.                                                                     

CAN I EXAMINE AND CANCEL THE POLICY OR AN INCREASE IN FACE AMOUNT?              

Yes. The Policy provides for an initial "Free-Look" period. You may cancel the  
Policy by mailing or delivering the Policy to the Service Office or an agent of 
the Company on or before the latest of:                                         

-    45 days after the application for the Policy is signed, or       

   -    10 days after you receive the Policy (or longer if required by state
law), or                                                    

 -    10 days after the Company mails or personally delivers a Notice of
Withdrawal Rights to you; or                                

   -    60 days after you receive the Policy, if the Policy was purchased in
New York as a replacement for an existing policy.           

When you return the Policy, the Company will mail a refund to you within seven  
days. The refund of any premium paid by check, however, may be delayed until the
check has cleared your bank.                                                    

Where required by state law, the refund will equal the premiums paid. In all    
other states or if the Policy was issued in New York as a replacement, the      
refund will equal the sum of:                                                   

(1)  the difference between the premiums, including fees and charges paid, and  
any amounts allocated to the Separate Account, plus                   

(2)  the value of the amounts allocated to the Separate Account, plus           

(3)  any fees or charges imposed on the amounts allocated to the Separate       
Account.                                                              

The amount refunded in (1) above includes any premiums allocated to the General 
Account.                                                                        

FREE LOOK WITH FACE AMOUNT INCREASES                                            

After an increase in the Face Amount, the Company will mail or personally       
deliver a notice of a "Free Look" with respect to the increase. You will have   
the right to cancel the increase before the latest of:                          

-    45 days after the application for the increase is signed, or     

    -    10 days after you receive the new specifications pages issued for the
increase (or longer if required by state law), or           

 -    10 days after the Company mails or delivers a Notice of Withdrawal
Rights to you.                                              

Upon canceling the increase, you will receive a credit to your Policy Value of  
charges which would not have been deducted but for the increase. The amount to  
be credited will be refunded if you so request. The Company also will waive any 
surrender charge calculated for the increase.

IS THERE A PAID-UP INSURANCE OPTION?                                            

Upon Written Request, a Policyowner may exercise a paid-up insurance option.    
Paid-up life insurance is fixed insurance, usually having a reduced Face Amount,
for the lifetime of the Insured with no further premiums due. If the Policyowner
elects this option, certain Policyowner rights and benefits may be limited.     

The paid-up fixed insurance will be in the amount that the Surrender Value of   
the Policy can purchase for a net single premium at the Insured's Age and       
Underwriting Class on the date this option is elected. The Company will transfer
any Policy Value in the Separate Account to the General Account on the date it  
receives the Written Request to elect the option. If the Surrender Value exceeds
the net single premium necessary for the fixed insurance, the Company will pay  
the excess to the Policyowner. The net single premium is based on the           
Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables, Smoker or Non-Smoker     
(Table B for unisex Policies) with increases in the tables for non-standard     
risks. Interest will not be less than 4.5%.                                     

IF THE PAID-UP INSURANCE OPTION IS ELECTED, THE FOLLOWING POLICYOWNER RIGHTS AND
BENEFITS WILL BE AFFECTED:                                                      

-    As described above, the paid-up insurance benefit is computed    
         differently from the net death benefit, and the death benefit options
will not apply.                                             

    -    The Company will transfer the Policy Value in the Separate Account to
      the General Account on the date it receives the written request to
          elect the option. The Company will not allow transfers of Policy Value
from the General Account back to the Separate Account.      

-    The Policyowner may not make further premium payments.           

   -    The Policyowner may not increase or decrease the Face Amount or make
partial withdrawals.                                        

-    Riders will continue only with the Company's consent.            

After electing paid-up fixed insurance, the Policyowner may make Policy loans or
surrender the Policy for its net cash value. The cash value is equal to the net 
single premium for paid-up insurance at the Insured's attained age. The net cash
value is the cash value less any outstanding loans.                             

DOES THE COMPANY SUPPORT INCENTIVE FUNDING DISCOUNTING?                         

Yes. The Company will lower the cost of insurance charges by 5% during any      
Policy year for which you qualify for an incentive funding discount. To qualify,
total premiums paid under the Policy, less any debt, withdrawals and withdrawal 
charges, and transfers from other policies issued by the Company, must exceed   
90% of the guideline level premiums (as defined in Section 7702 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), accumulated from the Date of Issue to the    
date of qualification. The incentive funding discount is not available in all   
states.                                                                         

The amount needed to qualify for the incentive funding discount is determined on
the Date of Issue for the first Policy year and on each Policy anniversary for  
each subsequent Policy year. If the Company receives the proceeds from a Policy 
issued by an unaffiliated company to be exchanged for the Policy, however, the  
qualification for the incentive funding discount for the first Policy year will 
be determined on the date the proceeds are received by the Company, and only    
insurance charges becoming due after the date such proceeds are received will be
eligible for the incentive funding discount.

HOW DO I MAKE PAYMENTS?                                                         

Payments are payable to the Company, and may be mailed to the Service Office or 
paid through one of the Company's authorized agents. All premium payments after 
the initial premium payment are credited to the Separate Account or the General 
Account as of date of receipt at the Service Office. Payments received before   
the close of business (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, or the close of the New  
York Stock Exchange, if earlier) on a business day will normally be credited to 
the Variable Account or the Fixed Account as of the end of that day. If we      
receive your payment after the close of business on a business day, your payment
or request will be effective as of the end of the next business day.            

PREMIUM FLEXIBILITY                                                             

Unlike conventional insurance policies, the Policy does not obligate you to pay 
premiums in accordance with a rigid and inflexible premium schedule. You may    
establish a schedule of planned premiums which will be billed by the Company at 
regular intervals. Failure to pay planned premiums will not itself cause the    
Policy to lapse. However, if the optional Guaranteed Death Benefit rider is in  
effect, certain minimum premium payment tests must be met.                      

You also may make unscheduled premium payments at any time prior to the Final   
Premium Payment Date or skip planned premium payments, subject to the maximum   
and minimum premium limitations described below.                                

You also may elect to pay premiums by means of a monthly automatic payment      
procedure. Under this procedure, amounts will be deducted each month from your  
checking account, generally on the Monthly Payment Date, from your checking     
account and applied as a premium under a Policy. The minimum payment permitted  
under this procedure is $50.                                                    

Premiums are not limited as to frequency and number. No premium payment may be  
less than $100, however, without the Company's consent. Moreover, premium       
payments must be sufficient to provide a positive Surrender Value at the end of 
each Policy month, or the Policy may lapse.                                     

MINIMUM MONTHLY FACTOR                                                          

The Minimum Monthly Factor is a monthly premium amount calculated by the Company
and specified in the Policy. If, in the first 48 Policy months following Date of
Issue or the effective date of an increase in the Face Amount or of a Policy    
Change which causes a change in the Minimum Monthly Factor:                     

    -    You make premium payments (less debt, partial withdrawals and partial
        withdrawal charges) at least equal to the sum of the Minimum Monthly
        Factors for the number of months the Policy, increase in Face Amount
or Policy Change has been in force, and                     

-    Debt does not exceed Policy Value less surrender charges, then   

-    the Policy is guaranteed not to lapse during that period.        

EXCEPT FOR THE 48 POLICY MONTH PERIODS, MAKING MONTHLY PAYMENTS AT LEAST EQUAL  
TO THE MINIMUM MONTHLY FACTOR DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE POLICY WILL REMAIN IN 
FORCE.                                                                          

In no event may the total of all premiums paid exceed the current maximum       
premium limitations set forth in the Policy, which are required by federal tax  
laws. These maximum premium limitations will change whenever there is any change
in the Face Amount, the deletion of a rider, or a change in the Sum Insured     
Option. If a premium is paid which would result in total premiums exceeding the 
current maximum premium limitations, the Company will accept only that portion  
of the premiums that shall make total premiums equal the maximum. Any part of   
the premiums in excess of that amount will be returned, and no further premiums 
will be accepted until allowed by the current maximum premium limitation        
prescribed by Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") rules.                           

20

P-->485APOS22nd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
Notwithstanding the current maximum premium limitations, however, the Company   
will accept a premium that is needed in order to prevent a lapse of the Policy  
during a Policy year.                                                           

HOW DO I ALLOCATE MY NET PAYMENTS?                                              

The Net Premium equals the premium paid less the 3.50% tax expense charge. In   
the application for a Policy, you indicate the initial allocation of Net        
Premiums among the General Account and the Sub-Accounts of the Separate Account.
You may allocate premiums to one or more Sub-Accounts, but may not have Policy  
Value in more than 20 Sub-Accounts at any one time. The minimum amount that may 
be allocated to a Sub-Account is 1% of Net Premium paid. Allocation percentages 
must be in whole numbers (for example, 33 1/3% may not be chosen) and must total
100%.                                                                           

FUTURE CHANGES ALLOWED                                                          

You may change the allocation of future Net Premiums by written or telephone    
request. An allocation change will be effective as of the date of receipt of the
request in good order at the Service Office.                                    

INVESTMENT RISK                                                                 

The Policy Value in the Sub-Accounts will vary with their investment experience.
You bear this investment risk. The investment performance may affect the Death  
Proceeds as well. Policyowners should periodically review their allocations of  
premiums and Policy Value in light of market conditions and overall financial   
planning requirements.                                                          

CAN I MAKE TRANSFERS?                                                           

Yes. Subject to the Company's then current rules, you may transfer the Policy   
Value among the Sub-Accounts or between a Sub-Account and the General Account.  
However, the Policy Value held in the General Account to secure a Policy loan   
may not be transferred. If we receive a transfer request after the close of     
business (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time or the close of the New York Stock   
Exchange, if earlier), it will be effected at the end of the next business day. 

IS THE TRANSFER PRIVILEGE SUBJECT TO ANY LIMITATIONS?                           

Yes. The transfer privilege is subject to the Company's consent. The Company    
reserves the right to impose limitations on transfers including, but not limited
to:                                                                             

-    the minimum or maximum amount that may be transferred,           

-    the minimum amount that may remain in a Sub-Account following a  
transfer from that Sub-Account,                             

-    the minimum period of time between transfers, and                

-    the maximum number of transfers in a period.                     

If you request a transfer from a Sub-Account that is higher than your Policy    
Value in the Sub-Account on the valuation date for the transfer request (for    
example, if you request a transfer of $100 from a Sub-Account and the Policy    
Value in the Sub-Account is only $98 on the valuation date), we will transfer   
all of the Policy Value in the Sub-Account.                                     

Currently, transfers to and from the General Account are permitted only if:     

   -    There has been at least a 90-day period since the last transfer from
the General Account, and                                    

    -    the amount transferred from the General Account in each transfer does
     not exceed the lesser of $100,000 or 25% of the Accumulated Value
under the Policy.                                           

21

P-->485APOS23rd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
Currently, the first 12 transfers in a Policy year will be free of a transfer   
charge. Thereafter, a $10 transfer charge will be deducted from the amount      
transferred for each transfer in that Policy year. The Company may increase or  
decrease this charge, but it is guaranteed never to exceed $25. Any transfers   
made with respect to a conversion privilege, Policy loan or material change in  
investment Policy will not count towards the 12 free transfers.                 

These rules are subject to change by the Company.                               

ARE THERE RESTRICTIONS ON DISRUPTIVE TRADING?                                   

This Policy is not designed for use by individuals, professional market timing  
organizations, or other entities that engage in short-term trading, frequent    
transfers, programmed transfers or transfers that are large in relation to the  
total assets of an Underlying Fund (collectively, "Disruptive Trading"). These  
activities may require the Underlying Fund to maintain undesirable large cash   
positions or frequently buy or sell portfolio securities. Such transfers may    
dilute the value of the Underlying Fund's shares, interfere with the efficient  
management of the Underlying Fund's portfolio, and increase brokerage and       
administrative costs of the Underlying Funds. As a result, Disruptive Trading   
may adversely affect an Underlying Fund's ability to invest effectively in      
accordance with its investment objectives and policies, and may harm other      
Policy Owners.                                                                  

In order to protect our Policy Owners and the Underlying Funds from potentially 
harmful trading activity, we utilize certain policies and procedures that are   
designed to detect and prevent disruptive trading among the Underlying Funds    
(the "Disruptive Trading Procedures"). Our Disruptive Trading Procedures        
consider certain factors in order to identify Disruptive Trading activity,      
including the following:                                                        

-    the number of transfers made over a period of time;                        

-    the length of time between transfers;                                      

-    whether the transfers follow a pattern that appears to be designed to take 
  advantage of short term market fluctuations, particularly within certain
Underlying Funds;                                                     

-    the dollar amount(s) requested for transfers; and                          

-    whether the transfers are part of a group of transfers made by a third     
party on behalf of several individual Policy Owners; and              

-    the investment objectives and/or size of the Underlying Funds.             

We may increase our monitoring of Policy Owners who engage in what we perceive  
to be disruptive trading, including investigating the transfer patterns within  
multiple contracts owned by the same Policy Owners. We will also investigate any
patterns of disruptive trading identified by the Underlying Funds that may not  
have been captured by our Disruptive Trading Procedures.                        

Our Disruptive Trading Procedures may vary from Sub-Account to Sub-Account. The 
Disruptive Trading Procedures limit the number of transfers a Policy Owner may  
make during a given period, limit the number of times a Policy Owner may        
transfer into particular funds during a given period, and place restrictions as 
to the time or means of transfers (for example, transfer instructions are       
required by a certain daily time cutoff), among other things. In certain states,
the Disruptive Trading Procedures apply dollar or percentage limitations, rather
than restrictions on the number of transfers. Subject to the terms of the       
Policy, the Company reserves the right to impose, without prior notice,         
additional or alternate restrictions on allocations and transfers that it       
determines, in its sole discretion, will disadvantage or potentially hurt the   
rights or interests of other Policy Owners or other holders of the Underlying   
Funds.                                                                          

In addition, some of the Underlying Funds have reserved the right to temporarily
or permanently refuse payments or transfer requests from the Company if, in the 
judgment of the Underlying Fund's investment adviser, the Underlying Fund would 
be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objective     

22

P-->485APOS24th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
or policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected. If an        
Underlying Fund refuses a transfer request from the Company, the Company may not
be able to effect certain allocations or transfers that a Policy Owner has      
requested. In the future, some Underlying Funds may impose redemption fees on   
short-term trading (i.e., redemptions of mutual fund shares within a certain    
number of business days after purchase). We reserve the right to administer and 
collect any such redemption fees on behalf of the Underlying Funds.             

We apply our Disruptive Trading Procedures consistently without special         
arrangement, waiver, or exception. However, the Company's ability to detect and 
deter Disruptive Trading and to consistently apply the Disruptive Trading       
Procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological limitations. 
Policy Owners seeking to engage in such transfer activities may employ a variety
of strategies to avoid detection. Because identifying Disruptive Trading        
involves judgments that are inherently subjective, the Company cannot provide   
assurances that its Disruptive Trading Procedures will detect every Policy Owner
who engages in disruptive trading. In addition, the terms of some contracts     
previously issued by the Company, historical practices or actions, litigation,  
or certain regulatory restrictions may limit the Company's ability to apply     
transfer or other restrictions.                                                 

If we are unable to detect Disruptive Trading or are unable to restrict         
Disruptive Trading because of contract provisions, you may experience dilution  
in the value of your Underlying Fund shares. There may be increased brokerage   
and administrative costs within the Underlying Funds, which may result in lower 
long-term returns for your investments. Additionally, because other insurance   
companies and/or retirement plans may invest in the Underlying Funds, we cannot 
guarantee that the Underlying Funds will not suffer harm from disruptive trading
within the variable contracts issued by other insurance companies or among      
investment options available to retirement plan participants.                   

Under rules recently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission,         
effective April 16, 2007, we will be required to: (1) enter into a written      
agreement with each Underlying Fund or its principal underwriter that will      
obligate us to provide to the Underlying Fund promptly upon request certain     
information about the trading activity of individual Contract Owners, and (2)   
execute instructions from the Underlying Fund to restrict or prohibit further   
purchases or transfers by specific Contract Owners who violate the frequent     
trading policies established by the Underlying Fund.                            

IS THERE A DOLLAR-COST AVERAGING OPTION OR AUTOMATIC REBALANCING OPTION?        

Yes. You may have automatic transfers of at least $100 a month made on a        
periodic basis:                                                                 

   -    from the Sub-Accounts which invest in the Goldman Sachs Money Market
          Fund and Goldman Sachs Government Income Fund, respectively, to one or
       more of the other Sub-Accounts ("Dollar-Cost Averaging Option"), or

-    to reallocate Policy Value among the Sub-Accounts ("Automatic    
Rebalancing Option").                                       

Automatic transfers may be made on a monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual
or annual schedule. The first automatic transfer counts as one transfer towards 
the 12 free transfers allowed in each Policy year; each subsequent automatic    
transfer is without charge and does not reduce the remaining number of transfers
which may be made free of charge. Generally, all transfers will be processed on 
the 15th of each scheduled month. If the 15th is not a business day, however, or
is the Monthly Payment Date, the automatic transfer will be processed on the    
next business day. The Dollar-Cost Averaging Option and the Automatic           
Rebalancing Option may not be in effect at the same time.                       

If the policy goes into a grace period (see WHAT ARE THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS 
OF THE POLICY? under TERMINATION AND REINSTATEMENT), automatic Dollar Cost      
Averaging and Automatic Account Rebalancing transactions are suspended. If you  
make sufficient payments to keep the policy in force, Dollar Cost Averaging and 
Automatic Account Rebalancing will resume with the next scheduled automatic     
transaction.

P-->485APOS25th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
CAN I MAKE FUTURE CHANGES UNDER MY POLICY?                                      

Yes. There are several changes you can make after receiving your Policy, within 
limits. You may:                                                                

-    Cancel your Policy under its right-to-examine provision          

-    Transfer your ownership to someone else                          

-    Change the beneficiary                                           

-    Change the allocation of payments, with no tax consequences under
current law                                                 

-    Make transfers of Policy Value among the funds                   

   -    Adjust the death benefit by increasing or decreasing the Face Amount

-    Add or remove certain optional insurance benefits                

HOW DO I CHANGE THE FACE AMOUNT OF MY POLICY?                                   

Subject to certain limitations, you may increase or decrease the specified Face 
Amount of a Policy at any time by submitting a Written Request to the Company.  
Any increase or decrease in the specified Face Amount requested by you will     
become effective on the Monthly Payment Date on or next following the date of   
receipt of the request at the Service Office or, if Evidence of Insurability is 
required, the date of approval of the request.                                  

INCREASES IN THE FACE AMOUNT                                                    

Along with the Written Request for an increase, you must submit satisfactory    
Evidence of Insurability. The consent of the Insured also is required whenever  
the Face Amount is increased. A request for an increase in the Face Amount may  
not be less than $10,000. You may not increase the Face Amount after the Insured
reaches Age 85. An increase must be accompanied by an additional premium if the 
Surrender Value is less than $50 plus an amount equal to the sum of two Minimum 
Monthly Factors.                                                                

On the effective date of each increase in the Face Amount, a transaction charge 
of $40 will be deducted from the Policy Value for administrative costs. The     
effective date of the increase will be the first Monthly Payment Date on or     
following the date all of the conditions for the increase are met.              

An increase in the Face Amount generally will affect the Insurance Amount at    
Risk, and may affect the portion of the Insurance Amount at Risk included in    
various Premium Classes (if more than one Premium Class applies), both of which 
may affect the monthly cost of insurance charges. A surrender charge also will  
be calculated for the increase.                                                 

After increasing the Face Amount, you will have the right (1) during a Free-Look
Period, to have the increase canceled and the charges which would not have been 
deducted but for the increase will be credited to the Policy, and (2) during the
first 24 months following the increase, to transfer any or all Policy Value to  
the General Account free of charge. A refund of charges which would not have    
been deducted but for the increase will be made at your request.                

DECREASES IN THE FACE AMOUNT                                                    

The minimum amount for a decrease in the Face Amount is $10,000. The Face Amount
in force after any decrease may not be less than $50,000. If, following a       
decrease in the Face Amount, the Policy would not comply with the maximum       
premium limitation applicable under the IRS Rules, the decrease may be limited  
or Policy Value may be returned to the Policyowner (at your election) to the    
extent necessary to meet the requirements. A return of Policy Value may result  
in tax liability to you.                                                        

A decrease in the Face Amount will affect the total Insurance Amount at Risk and
the portion of the Insurance Amount at Risk covered by various Premium Classes, 
both of which may affect a Policyowner's monthly cost of insurance charges. For 
purposes of determining the cost of insurance charge, any decrease in the Face  
Amount will reduce the Face Amount in the following order:                      

24

P-->485APOS26th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
-    the Face Amount provided by the most recent increase;            

-    the next most recent increases successively; and                 

-    the initial Face Amount.                                         

This order also will be used to determine whether a surrender charge will be    
deducted and in what amount. If you request a decrease in the Face Amount, the  
amount of any surrender charge deducted will reduce the current Policy Value.   
You may specify one Sub-Account from which the surrender charge will be         
deducted. If no specification is provided, the Company will make a Pro-Rata     
Allocation. The current surrender charge will be reduced by the amount deducted.

CAN I CONVERT MY POLICY INTO A FIXED POLICY?                                    

Once during the first 24 months after the Date of Issue or after the effective  
date of an increase in Face Amount (assuming the Policy is in force), you may   
convert your Policy without Evidence of Insurability to a flexible premium      
adjustable life insurance policy with fixed and guaranteed minimum benefits.    
Assuming that there have been no increases in the initial Face Amount, you can  
accomplish this within 24 months after the Date of Issue by transferring,       
without charge, the Policy Value in the Separate Account to the General Account 
and by simultaneously changing your premium allocation instructions to allocate 
future premium payments to the General Account. Within 24 months after the      
effective date of each increase, you can transfer, without charge, all or part  
of the Policy Value in the Separate Account to the General Account and          
simultaneously change your premium allocation instructions to allocate all or   
part of future premium payments to the General Account.                         

Where required by state law, at your request the Company will issue a flexible  
premium adjustable life insurance Policy to you. The new Policy will have the   
same Face Amount, Issue Age, Dates of Issue, and Premium Class as the original  
Policy.                                                                         

CAN I MAKE POLICY LOANS?                                                        

You may borrow against the Policy Value. Policy loans may be obtained by request
to the Company on the sole security of the Policy. The total amount which may be
borrowed is the Loan Value.                                                     

In the first Policy year, the Loan Value is 75% of Policy Value reduced by      
applicable surrender charges, as well as Monthly Deductions and interest on Debt
to the end of the Policy year. The Loan Value in the second Policy year and     
thereafter is 90% of an amount equal to the Policy Value reduced by applicable  
surrender charges. There is no minimum limit on the amount of the loan.         

You must use Company forms to request a loan. You may obtain a Company loan form
by calling 1-800-533-7881. You may also obtain a Company loan form at our       
Company web site, https://cwannuity.se2.com.                                    

The loan amount normally will be paid within seven days after the Company       
receives the written loan request on a Company loan form at the Service Office, 
but the Company may delay payments under certain circumstances.                 

A Policy loan may be allocated among the General Account and one or more        
Sub-Accounts. If you do not make an allocation, the Company will make a Pro-Rata
Allocation based on the amounts in the Accounts on the date the Company receives
the loan request. The Policy Value in each Sub-Account equal to the Policy loan 
allocated to such Sub-Account will be transferred to the General Account as     
security for the loan, and the number of Accumulation Units equal to the Policy 
Value so transferred will be canceled. This will reduce the Policy Value in     
these Sub-Accounts. These transactions are not treated as transfers for purposes
of the transfer charge.                                                         

The Policy loan rights of Policyowners who are participants under Section 403(b)
plans are restricted.

25

P-->485APOS27th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
As long as the Policy is in force, the Policy Value in the General Account that 
is security for the loan amount will be credited with interest at an effective  
annual yield of at least 6.00% per year. NO ADDITIONAL INTEREST WILL BE CREDITED
TO SUCH POLICY VALUE.                                                           
PREFERRED LOAN OPTION                                                           

A preferred loan option is available under the Policy. The preferred loan option
will be available upon written request. It may be revoked by you at any time.   
You may change a preferred loan to a non-preferred loan at any time upon written
request. If this option has been selected, after the tenth Policy anniversary   
the Policy Value in the General Account that is equal to the loan amount will be
credited with interest at an effective annual yield of at least 7.5%. The       
Company's current position is to credit a rate of interest equal to the rate    
being charged for the preferred loan.                                           

There is some uncertainty as to the tax treatment of preferred loans, which may 
be treated as a taxable distribution from the Policy. Consult a qualified tax   
adviser. THE PREFERRED LOAN OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE IN ALL STATES.              

LOAN INTEREST CHARGED                                                           

Outstanding Policy loans are charged interest. Interest accrues daily and is    
payable in arrears at the annual rate of 8%. Interest is due and payable at the 
end of each Policy year or on a pro-rata basis for such shorter period as the   
loan may exist. Interest not paid when due will be added to the loan amount and 
will bear interest at the same rate. If the new loan amount exceeds the Policy  
Value in the General Account after the due and unpaid interest is added to the  
loan amount, the Company will the transfer Policy Value equal to that excess    
loan amount from the Policy Value in each Sub-Account to the General Account as 
security for the excess loan amount. The Company will allocate the amount       
transferred among the Sub-Accounts in the same proportion that the Policy Value 
in each Sub-Account bears to the total Policy Value in all Sub-Accounts.        

REPAYMENT OF LOANS                                                              

Loans may be repaid at any time prior to the lapse of the Policy. Upon repayment
of the Debt, the portion of the Policy Value that is in the General Account     
securing the loan repaid will be allocated to the various Accounts and increase 
the Policy Value in such accounts in accordance with your instructions. If you  
do not make a repayment allocation, the Company will allocate Policy Value in   
accordance with your most recent premium allocation instructions; provided,     
however, that loan repayments allocated to the Separate Account cannot exceed   
the Policy Value previously transferred from the Separate Account to secure the 
Debt.                                                                           

If Debt exceeds the Policy Value less the surrender charge, the Policy will     
terminate. A notice of such pending termination will be mailed to the last known
address of you and any assignee. If you do not make sufficient payment within 62
days after this notice is mailed, the Policy will terminate with no value.      

EFFECT OF POLICY LOANS                                                          

Policy loans may be repaid at any time prior to the lapse of the Policy.        
However, because Policy loans do not participate in the investment experience of
the Separate Account, Policy loans will permanently affect the Policy Value and 
Surrender Value, and may permanently affect the Death Proceeds, whether or not  
the loan is repaid. The effect could be favorable or unfavorable, depending upon
whether the investment performance of the Sub-Account(s) is less than or greater
than the interest credited to the Policy Value in the General Account that is   
security for the loan. Moreover, outstanding Policy loans and the accrued       
interest will be deducted from the proceeds payable upon the death of the       
Insured or surrender.                                                           

ARE POLICY LOANS PERMITTED IF THE POLICY WAS ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH A TSA    
PLAN?                                                                           

If your Policy was issued in connection with a TSA plan, Policy loans are       
permitted in accordance with the terms of the Policy. However, if a Policy loan 
does not comply with the requirements of Code Section 72(p), the TSA plan may   
become disqualified and Policy Values may be includible in your current income. 
Policy loans must meet the following additional requirements:                   

26

P-->485APOS28th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
-    Loans must be repaid within five years, except when the loan is used to    
   acquire any dwelling unit which within a reasonable time is to be used as
the Policy owner's principal residence.                               

-    All Policy loans must be amortized on a level basis with loan repayments   
being made not less frequently than quarterly.                        

-    The sum of all outstanding loan balances for all loans from all of your TSA
plans may not exceed the lesser of:                                   

          -    $50,000 reduced by the excess (if any) of the highest outstanding
              balance of loans from all of the Policy owner's TSA plans during
           the one-year period preceding the date of the loan, minus the
               outstanding balance of loans from the Policy owner's TSA plans on
the date on which such loan was made;             

OR

         -    50% of the Policy owner's non-forfeitable accrued benefit in all
of his/her TSA plans, but not less than $10,000.  

A QUALIFIED TAX ADVISER SHOULD BE CONSULTED BEFORE REQUESTING A POLICY LOAN IN  
CONNECTION WITH A TSA PLAN.                                                     
CAN I SURRENDER THE POLICY?                                                     

Yes. You may surrender the Policy and receive its Surrender Value. You must use 
Company forms to surrender the Policy. You may obtain a Company surrender form  
by calling 1-800-533-7881. The Surrender Value will be calculated as of the     
Valuation Date on which the Policy and completed surrender forms are received in
good order at the Service Office.                                               

The Surrender Value is equal to:                                                

-    the Policy Value, MINUS                                          

-    any Debt and applicable surrender charges.                       

A surrender charge is calculated upon issuance of the Policy and from the       
effective date of any increase in the Face Amount. The duration of the surrender
charge is 15 years for issue Ages 0 through 50, grading down to 10 years for    
issue Ages 55 and above.                                                        

The proceeds on surrender may be paid in a single lump sum or under one of the  
payment options. Normally, the Company will pay the Surrender Value within seven
days following the Company's receipt of the surrender request, but the Company  
may delay payment under the circumstances described under OTHER INFORMATION -   
CAN THE COMPANY DELAY PAYMENTS TO ME?                                           

The surrender rights of Policyowners who are participants under Section 403(b)  
plans or who are participants in the Texas Optional Retirement Program (Texas   
ORP) are restricted.                                                            

For important tax consequences which may result from surrender, see FEDERAL TAX 
CONSIDERATIONS.                                                                 
CAN I MAKE PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS?                                                 

Yes. Any time after the first Policy year, you may withdraw a portion of the    
Surrender Value of your Policy, subject to the limits stated below. You must use
Company forms to request a withdrawal. You may obtain a Company withdrawal form 
by calling 1-800-533-7881. You may also obtain a Company withdrawal form at our 
Company web site, https://cwannuity.se2.com. The written request on a Company   
withdrawal form must indicate the dollar amount you wish to receive and the     
Accounts from which such amount is to be withdrawn. You may allocate the amount 
withdrawn among the Sub-Accounts and the General Account. If you do not provide 
allocation instructions, the Company will make a Pro-Rata Allocation. Each      
partial withdrawal must be in                                                   

27

P-->485APOS29th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
a minimum amount of $500.                                                       

Under Sum Insured Option 1, the Face Amount is reduced by the amount of the     
withdrawal, and a withdrawal will not be allowed if it would reduce the Face    
Amount below $40,000. See THE DEATH BENEFIT.                                    

A withdrawal from a Sub-Account will result in the cancellation of the number of
Accumulation Units equivalent in value to the amount withdrawn. The amount      
withdrawn equals the amount requested by you plus the transaction charge and any
applicable partial withdrawal charge. Normally, the Company will pay the amount 
of the partial withdrawal within seven days following the Company's receipt of  
the partial withdrawal request, but the Company may delay payment under certain 
circumstances.                                                                  

The withdrawal rights of Policyowners who are participants under Section 403(b) 
plans or who are participants in the Texas Optional Retirement Program (Texas   
ORP) are restricted. For important tax consequences which may result from       
partial withdrawals, see FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS.                            

WHAT IS THE POLICY VALUE?                                                       

The Policy Value is the total amount available for investment, and is equal to  
the sum of:                                                                     

-    your accumulation in the General Account, plus                   

-    the value of the Accumulation Units in the Sub-Accounts.         

The Policy Value is used in determining the Surrender Value (the Policy Value   
less any Debt and applicable surrender charges). There is no guaranteed minimum 
Policy Value. Because the Policy Value on any date depends upon a number of     
variables, it cannot be predetermined.                                          

The Policy Value and the Surrender Value will reflect the frequency and amount  
of Net Premiums paid, interest credited to accumulations in the General Account,
the investment performance of the chosen Sub-Accounts, any partial withdrawals, 
any loans, any loan repayments, any loan interest paid or credited, and any     
charges assessed in connection with the Policy.                                 

CALCULATION OF POLICY VALUE                                                     

The Policy Value is determined first on the Date of Issue and thereafter on each
Valuation Date. On the Date of Issue, the Policy Value will be the Net Premiums 
received, plus any interest earned during the underwriting period when premiums 
are held in the General Account (before being transferred to the Separate       
Account) less any Monthly Deductions due. On each Valuation Date after the Date 
of Issue the Policy Value will be:                                              

-    the aggregate of the values in each of the Sub-Accounts on the   
      Valuation Date, determined for each Sub-Account by multiplying the
         value of an Accumulation Unit in that Sub-Account on that date by the
    number of such Accumulations Units allocated to the Policy; plus

     -    the value in the General Account (including any amounts transferred to
the General Account as collateral with respect to a loan).  

Thus, the Policy Value is determined by multiplying the number of Accumulation  
Units in each Sub-Account by the value of the applicable Accumulation Units on  
the particular Valuation Date, adding the products, and adding the amount of the
accumulations in the General Account, if any.                                   

THE ACCUMULATION UNIT                                                           

Each Net Premium is allocated to the Sub-Account(s) selected by you. Allocations
to the Sub-Accounts are credited to the Policy in the form of Accumulation      
Units. Accumulation Units are credited separately for each Sub-Account.         

28

P-->485APOS30th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
The number of Accumulation Units of each Sub-Account credited to the Policy is  
equal to the portion of the Net Premium allocated to the Sub-Account, divided by
the dollar value of the applicable Accumulation Unit as of the Valuation Date   
the payment is received at the Service Office. The number of Accumulation Units 
will remain fixed unless changed by a subsequent split of Accumulation Unit     
value, transfer, partial withdrawal or Policy surrender. In addition, if the    
Company is deducting the Monthly Deduction or other charges from a Sub-Account, 
each such deduction will result in cancellation of a number of Accumulation     
Units equal in value to the amount deducted.                                    

The dollar value of an Accumulation Unit of each Sub-Account varies from        
Valuation Date to Valuation Date based on the investment experience of that     
Sub-Account. That experience, in turn, will reflect the investment performance, 
expenses and charges of the respective Underlying Fund. The value of an         
Accumulation Unit was set at $1.00 on the first Valuation Date for each         
Sub-Account. The dollar value of an Accumulation Unit on a given Valuation Date 
is determined by multiplying the dollar value of the corresponding Accumulation 
Unit as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date by the appropriate net      
investment factor.                                                              

Valuation Dates currently occur on each day on which the New York Stock Exchange
is open for trading, and on such other days (other than a day during which no   
payment, partial withdrawal, or surrender of a Policy is received) when there is
a sufficient degree of trading in an Underlying Fund's securities such that the 
current net asset value of the Sub-Accounts may be affected materially.         

NET INVESTMENT FACTOR                                                           

The net investment factor measures the investment performance of a Sub-Account  
of the Separate Account during the Valuation Period just ended. The net         
investment factor for each Sub-Account is equal to 1.0000 plus the number       
arrived at by dividing (a) by (b) and subtracting (c) and (d) from the result,  
where:                                                                          

(a)  is the investment income of that Sub-Account for the Valuation Period, plus
capital gains, realized or unrealized, credited during the Valuation  
  Period; minus capital losses, realized or unrealized, charged during the
Valuation Period; adjusted for provisions made for taxes, if any;     

(b)  is the value of that Sub-Account's assets at the beginning of the Valuation
Period;                                                               

(c)  is a charge for each day in the Valuation Period equal, on an annual basis,
     to 0.65% of the daily net asset value of that Sub-Account for mortality and
  expense risks. This charge may be increased or decreased by the Company,
but may not exceed 0.90%; and                                         

(d)  is the Separate Account administrative charge for each day in the Valuation
    Period equal, on an annual basis, to 0.15% of the daily net asset value of
   that Sub-Account. The administrative charge may be increased or decreased
  by the Company, but may not exceed 0.25%. This charge is applicable only
during the first ten Policy years.                                    

The net investment factor may be greater or less than one. Therefore, the value 
of an Accumulation Unit may increase or decrease. You bear the investment risk. 

Allocations to the General Account are not converted into Accumulation Units,   
but are credited interest at a rate periodically set by the Company.

 THE DEATH BENEFIT

As long as the Policy remains in force (see TERMINATION AND REINSTATEMENT), upon
due proof of the Insured's death, the Company will pay the Death Proceeds of the
Policy to the named Beneficiary. The Company normally will pay the Death        
Proceeds within seven days of receiving due proof of the Insured's death, but   
the Company may delay payments under certain circumstances. See OTHER           
INFORMATION -- CAN THE COMPANY DELAY PAYMENTS TO ME? The Death Proceeds may be  
received by the Beneficiary in cash or under one or more of the payment options 
set forth in the Policy. See THE DEATH BENEFIT - WHAT ARE THE DEATH PROCEEDS    
PAYMENT OPTIONS?                                                                

Prior to the Final Premium Payment Date, the Death Proceeds are equal to:       

-    the Sum Insured provided under Option 1 or Option 2, whichever is
elected and in effect on the date of death; plus            

 -    any additional insurance on the Insured's life that is provided by
rider; minus                                                

   -    any outstanding Debt, any partial withdrawals and partial withdrawal
         charges, and any Monthly Deductions due and unpaid through the Policy
month in which the Insured dies.                            

After the Final Premium Payment Date, the Death Proceeds equal the Surrender    
Value of the Policy, unless the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is in effect. If 
the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is in effect, the Death Proceed equal the    
greater of the Face Amount or Surrender Value. The amount of Death Proceeds     
payable will be determined as of the date the Company receives due proof of the 
Insured's death for Option 2 and on the date of the Insured's death for Option  
1.                                                                              

WHAT ARE THE SUM INSURED OPTIONS?                                               

The Policy provides two Sum Insured Options: Option 1 and Option 2, as described
below. You designate the desired Sum Insured Option in the application. You may 
change the Option once per Policy year by written request. There is no charge   
for a change in Option.                                                         

Under Option 1, the Sum Insured is equal to the greater of the Face Amount of   
insurance or the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured. Under Option 2, the Sum Insured 
is equal to the greater of the Face Amount of insurance plus the Policy Value or
the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured.                                              

GUIDELINE MINIMUM SUM INSURED                                                   

To remain qualified as "life insurance" for federal tax purposes, federal tax   
law requires that policies have a minimum amount of pure life insurance         
protection in relation to the size of the Policy Value. The Guideline Minimum   
Sum Insured is used to determine compliance with this requirement. So long as   
the Policy qualifies as a life insurance contract, the insurance proceeds will  
be excluded from the gross income of the Beneficiary.

95 and above                                          100%    

For the Ages not listed, the progression between the listed Ages is linear.     

Under both Option 1 and Option 2, the Sum Insured provides insurance protection.
Under Option 1, the Sum Insured remains level unless the applicable percentage  
of Policy Value under the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured exceeds the Face Amount,
in which case the Sum Insured will vary as the Policy Value varies. Under Option
2, the Sum Insured varies as the Policy Value changes.                          

For any Face Amount, the amount of the Sum Insured (and the Death Proceeds) will
be greater under Option 2 than under Option 1. This is because the Policy Value 
is added to the specified Face Amount and included in the Death Proceeds only   
under Option 2. Under Option 2, however, the cost of insurance included in the  
Monthly Deduction will be greater, and the rate at which Policy Value will      
accumulate will be slower (assuming the same specified Face Amount and the same 
actual premiums paid). See CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS --WHAT IS THE MONTHLY         
DEDUCTION?                                                                      

If you desire to have premium payments and investment performance reflected in  
the amount of the Sum Insured, you should choose Option 2. If you desire premium
payments and investment performance reflected to the maximum extent in the      
Policy Value, you should select Option 1.                                       

CAN I CHANGE THE SUM INSURED OPTION?                                            

Generally, the Sum Insured Option in effect may be changed once each Policy year
by sending a Written Request for change to the Service Office. Changing Sum     
Insured Options will not require Evidence of Insurability. The effective date of
any such change will be the Monthly Payment Date on or following the date of    
receipt of the request. No charges will be imposed on changes in Sum Insured    
Options.                                                                        

CHANGE FROM OPTION 1 TO OPTION 2                                                

If the Sum Insured Option is changed from Option 1 to Option 2, the Face Amount 
will be decreased to equal the Sum Insured less the Policy Value on the         
effective date of the change. This change may not be made if it would result in 
a Face Amount of less than $40,000. A change from Option 1 to Option 2 will not 
alter the amount of the Sum Insured at the time of the change, but will affect  
the determination of the Sum Insured from that point on. Because the Policy     
Value will be added to the new specified Face Amount, the Sum Insured will vary 
with the Policy Value. Under Option 2, the Insurance Amount at Risk always will 
equal the Face Amount unless the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured is in effect. The
cost of insurance also may be higher or lower than it otherwise would have been 
without the change in Sum Insured Option. See CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS -- WHAT IS 
THE MONTHLY DEDUCTION?

CHANGE FROM OPTION 2 TO OPTION 1                                                

If the Sum Insured Option is changed from Option 2 to Option 1, the Face Amount 
will be increased to equal the Sum Insured which would have been payable under  
Option 2 on the effective date of the change (i.e., the Face Amount immediately 
prior to the change plus the Policy Value on the date of the change). The amount
of the Sum Insured will not be altered at the time of the change. The change in 
option, however, will affect the determination of the Sum Insured from that     
point on, since the Policy Value no longer will be added to the Face Amount in  
determining the Sum Insured; the Sum Insured will equal the new Face Amount (or,
if higher, the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured). The cost of insurance may be     
higher or lower than it otherwise would have been since any increases or        
decreases in Policy Value will reduce or increase, respectively, the Insurance  
Amount at Risk under Option 1. Assuming a positive net investment return with   
respect to any amounts in the Separate Account, changing the Sum Insured Option 
from Option 2 to Option 1 will reduce the Insurance Amount at Risk and therefore
the cost of insurance charge for all subsequent Monthly Deductions, compared to 
what such charge would have been if no such change were made.                   

A change in Sum Insured Option may result in total premiums paid exceeding the  
then-current maximum premium limitation determined by IRS Rules. In such event, 
the Company will pay the excess to the Policyowner.                             

IS A GUARANTEED DEATH BENEFIT AVAILABLE?                                        

Yes. An optional Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is available only at issue of   
the Policy. If this rider is in effect, the Company:                            

-    guarantees that your Policy will not lapse regardless of the     
investment performance of the Separate Account and          

-    provides a guaranteed death benefit.                             

In order to maintain the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider, certain minimum premium
payment tests must be met on each Policy anniversary and within 48 months       
following the Date of Issue and/or the date of any increase in Face Amount, as  
described below. In addition, a one-time administrative charge of $25 is        
deducted from Policy Value when the Rider is elected. Certain transactions,     
including Policy Loans, partial withdrawals, and changes in Sum Insured Options,
can result in the termination of the rider. If this rider is terminated, it     
cannot be reinstated.                                                           

GUARANTEED DEATH BENEFIT TESTS                                                  

While the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is in effect, the Policy will not lapse
if the following two tests are met:                                             

1.   Within 48 months following the Date of Issue of the Policy or of any       
   increase in the Face Amount, the sum of the premiums paid, less any debt,
partial withdrawals and withdrawal charges, must be greater than the  
   Minimum Monthly Factors (if any) multiplied by the number of months which
     have elapsed since the Date of Issue or the effective date of increase; and

2.   On each Policy anniversary, (a) must exceed (b), where, since the Date of  
Issue:                                                                

    (a)  is the sum of your premiums, less any withdrawals, partial withdrawal
 charges and debt which is classified as a preferred loan; and

    (b)  is the sum of the minimum guaranteed death benefit premiums, as shown
on the specifications page of the Policy.

GUARANTEED DEATH BENEFIT                                                        

If the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is in effect on the Final Premium Payment 
Date, guaranteed Death Proceeds will be provided as long as the rider is in     
force. The Death Proceeds will be the greater of:                               

-    the Face Amount as of the Final Premium Payment Date; or         

    -    the Policy Value as of the date due proof of death is received by the
Company.                                                    

TERMINATION OF THE GUARANTEED DEATH BENEFIT RIDER                               

The Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider will end and may not be reinstated on the    
first to occur of the following:                                                

-    foreclosure of a Policy Loan; or                                 

     -    the date on which the sum of your payments does not meet or exceed the
          applicable Guaranteed Death Benefit test (above); or any Policy change
that results in a negative guideline level premium; or      

-    the effective date of a change from Sum Insured Option 2 to Sum  
        Insured Option I, if such change occurs within 5 Policy years of the
Final Premium Payment Date; or                              

     -    a request for a partial withdrawal or preferred loan is made after the
Final Premium Payment Date.                                 

It is possible that the Policy Value will not be sufficient to keep the Policy  
in force on the first Monthly Payment Date following the date the Rider         
terminates. The net amount payable to keep the Policy in force will never exceed
the surrender charge plus three Monthly Deductions.                             

WHAT ARE THE DEATH PROCEEDS PAYMENT OPTIONS?                                    

During the Insured's lifetime, you may arrange for the Death Proceeds to be paid
in a single sum or under one or more of the available payment options. These    
choices also are available at the Final Premium Payment Date and if the Policy  
is surrendered. The Company may make more payment options available in the      
future.                                                                         

If no election is made, the Company will pay the Death Proceeds in a single sum.
When the Death Proceeds are payable in a single sum, the Beneficiary may, within
one year of the Insured's death, select one or more of the payment options if no
payments have yet been made.                                                    

Upon Written Request, the Surrender Value or all or part of the Death Proceeds  
may be placed under one or more of the payment options below or any other option
offered by the Company. If you do not make an election, the Company will pay the
benefits in a single sum. A certificate will be provided to the payee describing
the payment option selected. If a payment option is selected, the Beneficiary   
may pay to the Company any amount that would otherwise be deducted from the Sum 
Insured.                                                                        

The amounts payable under a payment option for each $1,000 value applied will be
the greater of:                                                                 

-    The rate per $1,000 of value applied based on the Company's      
  non-guaranteed current payment option rates for the Policy, or

-    The rate in the Policy for the applicable payment option.        

The following payment options are currently available. The amounts payable under
these options are paid from the General Account. None is based on the investment
experience of the Separate Account.                                             

33

P-->485APOS35th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
   Option A: PAYMENTS FOR A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF YEARS. The Company will make
               equal payments for any selected number of years (not greater than
             30). Payments may be made annually, semi-annually, quarterly or
monthly.                                          

    Option B: LIFETIME MONTHLY PAYMENTS. Payments are based on the payee's age
      on the date the first payment will be made. One of three
            variations may be chosen. Depending upon this choice, payments
will end:                                         

        (1)  upon the death of the payee, with no further payments due (Life
Annuity), or                                      

   (2)  upon the death of the payee, but not before the sum of the
            payments made first equals or exceeds the amount applied under
    this option (Life Annuity with Installment Refund), or

          (3)  upon the death of the payee, but not before a selected period (5,
             10 or 20 years) has elapsed (Life Annuity with Period Certain).

Option C: INTEREST PAYMENTS. The Company will pay interest at a rate  
             determined by the Company each year, but which will not be less
      than 3.5%. Payments may be made annually, semi-annually,
               quarterly or monthly. Payments will end when the amount left with
        the Company has been withdrawn. However, payments will not
            continue after the death of the payee. Any unpaid balance plus
accrued interest will be paid in a lump sum.      

    Option D: PAYMENTS FOR A SPECIFIED AMOUNT. Payments will be made until the
           unpaid balance is exhausted. Interest will be credited to the
            unpaid balance. The rate of interest will be determined by the
             Company each year, but will not be less than 3.5%. Payments may
        be made annually, semi-annually, quarterly or monthly. The
              payment level selected must provide for the payment each year of
at least 8% of the amount applied.                

     Option E: LIFETIME MONTHLY PAYMENTS FOR TWO PAYEES. One of three variations
        may be chosen. After the death of one payee, payments will
continue to the survivor:                         

(1)  in the same amount as the original amount; or          

(2)  in an amount equal to 2/3 of the original amount; or   

(3)  in an amount equal to 1/2 of the original amount.      

Payments are based on the payees' ages on the date the first payment is due.    
Payments will end upon the death of the surviving payee.                        

SELECTION OF PAYMENT OPTIONS                                                    

The amount applied under any one option for any one payee must be at least      
$5,000. The periodic payment for any one payee must be at least $50. Subject to 
the Owner and/or the Beneficiary provisions of your Policy, any option selection
may be changed before the Death Proceeds become payable. If you make no         
selection, the Beneficiary may select an option when the Death Proceeds become  
payable.                                                                        

If the amount of monthly income payments under Option B(3) for the attained age 
of the payee are the same for different periods certain, the Company will deem  
an election to have been made for the longest period certain which could have   
been elected for such age and amount.                                           

You may give the Beneficiary the right to change from Option C or D to any other
option at any time. If the payee selects Option C or D when the Death Proceeds  
become payable, the payee may reserve the right to change to any other option at
a later date. The payee who elects to change options must also be a payee under 
the new option selected.

ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS                                                             

An additional deposit may be made to any proceeds when they are applied under   
Option B or E. A charge not to exceed 3% will be made. The Company may limit the
amount of this deposit.                                                         

RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS                                                          

A payee does not have the right to assign any amount payable under any option. A
payee does not have the right to commute any amount payable under Option B or E.
A payee will have the right to commute any amount payable under Option A only if
the right is reserved in the Written Request selecting the option. If the right 
to commute is exercised, the commuted values will be computed at the interest   
rates used to calculate the benefits. The amount left under Option C, and any   
unpaid balance under Option D, may be withdrawn by the payee only as set forth  
in the Written Request selecting the option. A corporation or fiduciary payee   
may select only Option A, C or D. Such selection will be subject to the consent 
of the Company.                                                                 

PAYMENT DATES                                                                   

The first payment under any option, except Option C, will be due on the date the
Policy matures by death or otherwise, unless another date is designated.        
Payments under Option C begin at the end of the first payment period.           

The last payment under any option will be made as stated in the description of  
that option. However, should a payee under Option B or E die prior to the due   
date of the second monthly payment, the amount applied less the first monthly   
payment will be paid in a lump sum or under any option other than Option E. A   
lump sum payment will be made to the surviving payee under Option E or the      
succeeding payee under Option B.

 TERMINATION AND REINSTATEMENT
WHAT ARE THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS OF THE POLICY?                              

The failure to make premium payments will not cause the Policy to lapse unless: 

(a)  the Surrender Value is insufficient to cover the next Monthly Deduction    
plus loan interest accrued; or                                        

(b)  the Debt exceeds the Policy Value less surrender charges.                  

If one of these situations occurs, the Policy will be in default. You then will 
have a grace period of 62 days, measured from the date of default, to make      
sufficient payments to prevent termination. On the date of default, the Company 
will send a notice to you and to any assignee of record. The notice will state  
the amount of premium due and the date on which it is due.                      

During the grace period, automatic Dollar Cost Averaging ("DCA") and Automatic  
Account Rebalancing ("AAR") transactions are suspended. If you make sufficient  
payments to keep the policy in force, DCA and AAR will resume with the next     
scheduled automatic transaction.                                                

Failure to make a sufficient payment within the grace period will result in     
termination of the Policy. If the Insured dies during the grace period, the     
Death Proceeds still will be payable, but any Monthly Deductions due and unpaid 
through the Policy month in which the Insured dies, and any other overdue       
charge, will be deducted from the Death Proceeds.                               

LIMITED 48-MONTH GUARANTEE                                                      

Except for the situation described in (b) above, the Policy is guaranteed not to
lapse during the first 48 months after the Date of Issue or the effective date  
of an increase in the Face Amount if you make a minimum amount of premium       
payments. The minimum amount paid, minus the Debt, partial withdrawals and      
partial withdrawal charges, must be at least equal to the sum of the Minimum    
Monthly Factors for the number of months the Policy, increase, or a Policy      
Change which causes a change in the Minimum Monthly Factor has been in force. A 
Policy Change which may cause a change in the amount of the Minimum Monthly     
Factor is a change in the Face Amount or the deletion of a rider.               

Except for the first 48 months after the Date of Issue or the effective date of 
an increase, payments equal to the Minimum Monthly Factor do not guarantee that 
the Policy will remain in force.                                                

WHAT ARE THE REINSTATEMENT PROVISIONS OF THE POLICY?                            

If the Policy has not been surrendered and the Insured is alive, the terminated 
Policy may be reinstated any time within three years after the date of default  
and before the Final Premium Payment Date. The reinstatement will be effective  
on the Monthly Payment Date following the date you submit the following to the  
Company:                                                                        

-    a written application for reinstatement,                         

-    Evidence of Insurability showing that the Insured is insurable   
according to the Company's underwriting rules, and          

-    a premium that, after the deduction of the tax expense charge, is
         large enough to cover the minimum amount payable, as described below.

36

P-->485APOS38th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
MINIMUM AMOUNT PAYABLE                                                          

If reinstatement is requested when fewer than 48 Monthly Deductions have been   
made since the Date of Issue or the effective date of an increase in the Face   
Amount, you must pay the lesser of the amount shown in A or B. Under A, the     
minimum amount payable is the Minimum Monthly Factor for the three-month period 
beginning on the date of reinstatement. Under B, the minimum amount payable is  
the sum of:                                                                     

-    the amount by which the surrender charge as of the date of       
       reinstatement exceeds the Policy Value on the date of default, PLUS

     -    Monthly Deductions for the three-month period beginning on the date of
reinstatement.                                              

If reinstatement is requested after 48 Monthly Deductions have been made since  
the Date of Issue of the Policy or any increase in the Face Amount, you must pay
the amount shown in B above. The Company reserves the right to increase the     
Minimum Monthly Factor upon reinstatement.                                      

SURRENDER CHARGE 

The surrender charge on the date of reinstatement is the surrender charge which 
would have been in effect had the Policy remained in force from the Date of     
Issue. The Policy Value less Debt on the date of default will be restored to the
Policy to the extent it does not exceed the surrender charge on the date of     
reinstatement. Any Policy Value less the Debt as of the date of default which   
exceeds the surrender charge on the date of reinstatement will not be restored. 

POLICY VALUE ON REINSTATEMENT                                                   

The Policy Value on the date of reinstatement is:                               

 -    the Net Premium paid to reinstate the Policy increased by interest
      from the date the payment was received at the Service Office, PLUS

   -    an amount equal to the Policy Value less Debt on the date of default
        to the extent it does not exceed the surrender charge on the date of
reinstatement, MINUS                                        

-    the Monthly Deduction due on the date of reinstatement.          

You may not reinstate any Debt outstanding on the date of default or            
foreclosure.

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS

The following information repeats and expands upon information contained in     
SUMMARY OF RISKS AND BENEFITS: FEE TABLES. The charges described below will     
apply to your Policy under the circumstances described. Some of these charges   
apply throughout the Policy's duration. Other charges apply only if you choose  
options under the Policy.                                                       

WHAT CHARGES ARE DEDUCTED FROM PAYMENTS?                                        

Currently, a deduction of 3.50% of premiums for state and local premium taxes   
and federal taxes imposed for deferred acquisition costs ("DAC taxes") is made  
from each premium payment. The premium payment, less the tax expense charge,    
equals the Net Premium. The total charge is a combined state and local premium  
tax deduction of 2.50% of premiums and a DAC tax deduction of 1% of premiums.   

While the premium tax is deducted from each premium payment, some jurisdictions 
may not impose premium taxes. Premium taxes vary from state to state, ranging   
from zero to 4.0%, and the 2.50% rate attributable to premiums for state and    
local premium taxes approximates the average expenses to Commonwealth Annuity   
associated with the premium taxes. The charge may be higher or lower than the   
actual premium tax imposed by the applicable jurisdiction. However, Commonwealth
Annuity does not expect to make a profit from this charge.                      

The 1% rate attributable to premiums for DAC taxes approximates the Company's   
expenses in paying federal taxes for deferred acquisition costs associated with 
the Policy. The Company reserves the right to increase or decrease the DAC tax  
charge to reflect changes in the Company's expenses for premium taxes and DAC   
taxes.                                                                          

WHAT IS THE MONTHLY DEDUCTION?                                                  

Prior to the Final Premium Payment Date, a Monthly Deduction from the Policy    
Value will be made to cover a charge for the cost of insurance, a charge for any
optional insurance benefits added by rider, and a monthly administrative charge.
The cost of insurance charge and the monthly administrative charge are discussed
below. The Monthly Deduction on or following the effective date of a requested  
increase in the Face Amount also will include a $40 administrative charge for   
the increase.                                                                   

Prior to the Final Premium Payment Date, the Monthly Deduction will be deducted 
as of each Monthly Payment Date commencing with the Date of Issue of the Policy.
It will be allocated to one Sub-Account according to your instructions or, if no
allocation is specified, the Company will make a Pro-Rata Allocation. If the    
Sub-Account you specify does not have sufficient funds to cover the Monthly     
Deduction, the Company will deduct the charge for that month as if no           
specification were made. If, however, on subsequent Monthly Payment Dates there 
is sufficient Policy Value in the Sub-Account you specified, the Monthly        
Deduction will be deducted from that Sub-Account. No Monthly Deductions will be 
made on or after the Final Premium Payment Date.                                

COST OF INSURANCE                                                               

This charge is designed to compensate the Company for the anticipated cost of   
providing Death Proceeds to Beneficiaries of those Insureds who die prior to the
Final Premium Payment Date. The cost of insurance is determined on a monthly    
basis, and is determined separately for the initial Face Amount, for each       
subsequent increase in the Face Amount, and for riders. Because the cost of     
insurance depends upon a number of variables, it can vary from month to month.

P-->485APOS40th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
CALCULATION OF THE CHARGE - If you select Sum Insured Option 2, the monthly cost
of insurance charge for the initial Face Amount generally will equal the        
applicable cost of insurance rate multiplied by the initial Face Amount. If you 
select Sum Insured Option 1, however, the applicable cost of insurance rate will
be multiplied by the initial Face Amount less the Policy Value (minus charges   
for rider benefits) at the beginning of the Policy month. Thus, the cost of     
insurance charge may be greater for Policyowners who have selected Sum Insured  
Option 2 than for those who have selected Sum Insured Option 1 (assuming the    
same Face Amount in each case and assuming that the Guideline Minimum Sum       
Insured is not in effect). In other words, since the Sum Insured under Option 1 
remains constant while the Sum Insured under Option 2 varies with the Policy    
Value, any Policy Value increases will reduce the insurance charge under Option 
1 but not under Option 2.                                                       

INCREASES - If you select Sum Insured Option 2, the monthly insurance charge for
each increase in Face Amount (other than an increase caused by a change in Sum  
Insured Option) will be equal to the cost of insurance rate applicable to that  
increase multiplied by the increase in the Face Amount. If you select Sum       
Insured Option 1, the applicable cost of insurance rate will be multiplied by   
the increase in the Face Amount reduced by any Policy Value (minus rider        
charges) in excess of the initial Face Amount at the beginning of the Policy    
month.                                                                          

EFFECT OF THE GUIDELINE MINIMUM SUM INSURED                                     

If the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured is in effect under either Option, a monthly
cost of insurance charge also will be calculated for that additional portion of 
the Sum Insured that is required to comply with the Guideline rules. This charge
will be calculated by:                                                          

    -    multiplying the cost of insurance rate applicable to the initial Face
          Amount times the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured (Policy Value times the
applicable percentage), MINUS                               

             -    the greater of the Face Amount or the Policy Value (if you
selected Sum Insured Option 1)          

OR

             -    the Face Amount PLUS the Policy Value (if you selected Sum
Insured Option 2).                      

When the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured is in effect, the cost of insurance      
charge for the initial Face Amount and for any increases will be calculated as  
set forth above. The monthly cost of insurance charge also will be adjusted for 
any decreases in the Face Amount.                                               

COST OF INSURANCE RATES                                                         

Cost of insurance rates are based on male, female or a blended unisex rate      
table, Age and Premium Class of the Insured, the effective date of an increase  
or date of rider, as applicable, the amount of premiums paid less Debt, any     
partial withdrawals and withdrawal charges, risk classification and the         
Incentive Funding Discount, if applicable. For those Policies issued on a unisex
basis in certain states or in certain cases, sex-distinct rates do not apply.   

The cost of insurance rates are determined at the beginning of each Policy year 
for the initial Face Amount. The cost of insurance rates for an increase in the 
Face Amount or rider are determined annually on the anniversary of the effective
date of each increase or rider. The cost of insurance rates generally increase  
as the Insured's Age increases. The actual monthly cost of insurance rates will 
be based on the Company's expectations as to future mortality experience. They  
will not, however, be greater than the guaranteed cost of insurance rates set   
forth in the Policy. These guaranteed rates are based on the 1980 Commissioners 
Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables, Smoker or Non-Smoker (Mortality Table B for 
unisex Policies) and the Insured's sex and Age. The Tables used for this purpose
set forth different mortality estimates for males and females and for smokers   
and non-smokers. Any change in the cost of insurance rates will apply to all    
persons of the same insuring Age, sex and Premium Class whose Policies have been
in force for the same length of time.                                           

39

P-->485APOS41st�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
The Premium Class of an Insured will affect the cost of insurance rates. The    
Company currently places Insureds into preferred Premium Classes, standard      
Premium Classes and substandard Premium Classes. In an otherwise identical      
Policy, an Insured in the preferred Premium Class will have a lower cost of     
insurance than an Insured in a standard Premium Class who, in turn, will have a 
lower cost of insurance than an Insured in a substandard Premium Class with a   
higher mortality risk.                                                          

Premium Classes also are divided into two categories: smokers and non-smokers.  
Non-smoking Insureds will incur lower cost of insurance rates than Insureds who 
are classified as smokers but who are otherwise in the same Premium Class. Any  
Insured with an Age at issuance under 18 will be classified initially as regular
or substandard. The Insured then will be classified as a smoker at Age 18 unless
the Insured provides satisfactory evidence that the Insured is a non-smoker. The
Company will provide notice to you of the opportunity for the Insured to be     
classified as a non-smoker when the Insured reaches Age 18.                     

The cost of insurance rate is determined separately for the initial Face Amount 
and for the amount of any increase in the Face Amount. For each increase in the 
Face Amount you request, at a time when the Insured is in a less favorable      
Premium Class than previously, a correspondingly higher cost of insurance rate  
will apply only to that portion of the Insurance Amount at Risk for the         
increase. For the initial Face Amount and any prior increases, the Company will 
use the Premium Class previously applicable. On the other hand, if the Insured's
Premium Class improves on an increase, the lower cost of insurance rate         
generally will apply to the entire Insurance Amount at Risk.                    

MONTHLY ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE                                                   

Prior to the Final Premium Payment Date, a monthly administrative charge of $5  
per month will be deducted from the Policy Value. This charge will be used to   
compensate the Company for expenses incurred in the administration of the       
Policy, and will compensate the Company for first-year underwriting and other   
start-up expenses incurred in connection with the Policy. These expenses include
the cost of processing applications, conducting medical examinations,           
determining insurability and the Insured's Premium Class, and establishing      
Policy records. The Company does not expect to derive a profit from these       
charges.                                                                        

WHAT  CHARGES  ARE MADE  AGAINST  OR  REFLECTED  IN THE  ASSETS OF THE  SEPARATE
ACCOUNT?                                                                        

The Company assesses each Sub-Account with a charge for mortality and expense   
risks assumed by the Company, and a charge for administrative expenses of the   
Separate Account.                                                               

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE                                               

The Company currently makes a charge on an annual basis of 0.65% of the daily   
net asset value in each Sub-Account. This charge is for the mortality risk and  
expense risk which the Company assumes in relation to the variable portion of   
the Policy. The total charges may be increased or decreased by the Board of     
Directors of the Company once each year, subject to compliance with applicable  
state and federal requirements, but it may not exceed 0.90% on an annual basis. 

The mortality risk assumed by the Company is that Insureds may live for a       
shorter time than anticipated, and that the Company therefore will pay an       
aggregate amount of Death Proceeds greater than anticipated. The expense risk   
assumed is that the expenses incurred in issuing and administering the Policy   
will exceed the amounts realized from the administrative charges provided in the
Policy. If the charge for mortality and expense risks is not sufficient to cover
actual mortality experience and expenses, the Company will absorb the losses. If
costs are less than the amounts provided, the difference will be a profit to the
Company. To the extent this charge results in a current profit to the Company,  
such profit will be available for use by the Company for, among other things,   
the payment of distribution, sales and other expenses. Since mortality and      
expense risks involve future contingencies which are not subject to precise     
determination in advance, it is not feasible to identify specifically the       
portion of the charge which is applicable to each.

ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE                                                           

During the first ten Policy years, the Company assesses a charge on an annual   
basis of 0.15% of the daily net asset value in each Sub-Account. The charge may 
be increased or decreased by the Board of Directors of the Company, subject to  
compliance with applicable state and federal requirements, but it may not exceed
0.25% on an annual basis. The charge is assessed to help defray administrative  
expenses actually incurred in the administration of the Separate Account and the
Sub-Accounts. The administrative functions and expenses assumed by the Company  
in connection with the Separate Account and the Sub-Accounts include, but are   
not limited to, clerical, accounting, actuarial and legal services, rent,       
postage, telephone, office equipment and supplies, expenses of preparing and    
printing registration statements, expenses of preparing and typesetting         
prospectuses, and the cost of printing prospectuses not allocable to sales      
expense, filing and other fees.                                                 

The Company does not impose the Separate Account administrative charge after the
tenth Policy year. On the tenth Policy anniversary, the Company will convert    
your units in the Sub-Accounts to units that do not reflect the charge. There   
will be no change in your Policy Value as a result of the conversion, but the   
number of your units and the corresponding unit values will change.             

FUND EXPENSES                                                                   

Because the Sub-Accounts purchase shares of the Funds, the value of the         
Accumulation Units of the Sub-Accounts will reflect the investment advisory fee 
and other expenses incurred by the Funds. The prospectuses and statements of    
additional information of the Funds contain additional information concerning   
such fees and expenses.                                                         

Currently, no charges are made against the Sub-Accounts for federal or state    
income taxes. Should the Company determine that taxes will be imposed, the      
Company may make deductions from the Sub-Account to pay such taxes. See FEDERAL 
TAX CONSIDERATIONS. The imposition of such taxes would result in a reduction of 
the Policy Value in the Sub-Accounts.                                           

HOW IS THE SURRENDER CHARGE CALCULATED?                                         

The Policy provides for a contingent surrender charge. A separate surrender     
charge is calculated upon the issuance of the Policy and for each increase in   
the Face Amount. A surrender charge may be deducted if you request a full       
surrender of the Policy or a decrease in the Face Amount.                       

The surrender charge is comprised of a contingent deferred administrative charge
and a contingent deferred sales charge. The contingent deferred administrative  
charge compensates the Company for expenses incurred in administering the       
Policy. The contingent deferred sales charge compensates the Company for        
expenses relating to the distribution of the Policy, including agents'          
commissions, advertising and the printing of the prospectus and sales           
literature.                                                                     

The duration of the surrender charge is 15 years from the Date of Issue or from 
the effective date of any increase in the Face Amount for issue Ages 0 through  
50, grading down to 10 years for issue Ages 55 and above.                       

The maximum surrender charge calculated upon issuance of the Policy is equal to 
the sum of (a) plus (b) where:                                                  

(a)  is a deferred administrative charge equal to $8.50 per thousand dollars of 
the initial Face Amount, and                                          

(b)  is a deferred sales charge of 49% of premiums received, up to a maximum    
  number of Guideline Annual Premiums subject to the deferred sales charge
    that varies by issue Age from 1.660714 (for Ages 0 through 55) to 0.948980
(for Age 85).                                                         

41

P-->485APOS43rd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
In accordance with limitations under state insurance regulations, the amount of 
the maximum surrender charge will not exceed a specified amount per $1,000      
initial Face Amount. The maximum surrender charge continues in a level amount   
for 40 Policy months, and reduces by 0.5% or more per month (depending on issue 
Age) thereafter. This reduction in the maximum surrender charge will reduce the 
deferred sales charge and the deferred administrative charge proportionately.   

In accordance with limitations under state insurance regulations, the amount of 
the Surrender charge will not exceed a specified amount per $1,000 of increase. 
As is true for the initial Face Amount, (a) is a deferred administrative charge,
and (b) is a deferred sales charge. The maximum surrender charge for the        
increase continues in a level amount for 40 Policy months, and reduces by 0.5%  
or more per month (depending on Age) thereafter.                                

MAXIMUM SURRENDER CHARGE DURING FIRST TWO POLICY YEARS -- If you surrender the  
Policy during the first two Policy years following the Date of Issue before     
making premium payments associated with the initial Face Amount which are at    
least equal to one Guideline Annual Premium, the deferred administrative charge 
will be $8.50 per thousand dollars of the initial Face Amount, as described     
above, but the deferred sales charge will not exceed 29% of premiums received,  
up to one Guideline Annual Premium, plus 9% of premiums received in excess of   
one Guideline Annual Premium, but less than the maximum number of Guideline     
Annual Premiums subject to the deferred sales charge.                           

SEPARATE SURRENDER CHARGE FOR EACH FACE AMOUNT INCREASE -- A separate surrender 
charge will apply to and is calculated for each increase in the Face Amount. The
surrender charge for the increase is in addition to that for the initial Face   
Amount. The maximum surrender charge for the increase is equal to the sum of (a)
plus (b), where (a) is equal to $8.50 per thousand dollars of increase, and (b) 
is a deferred sales charge of 49% of premiums associated with the increase, up  
to a maximum number of Guideline Annual Premiums (for the increase) subject to  
the deferred sales charge that varies by Age (at the time of increase) from     
1.660714 (for Ages 0 through 55) to 0.948980 (for Age 80).                      

REDUCED CHARGE DURING FIRST TWO YEARS FOLLOWING INCREASE - During the first two 
Policy years following an increase in the Face Amount before making premium     
payments associated with the increase in the Face Amount which are at least     
equal to one Guideline Annual Premium, the deferred administrative charge will  
be $8.50 per thousand dollars of the Face Amount increase, as described above,  
but the deferred sales charge imposed will be less than the maximum described   
above. Upon such a surrender, the deferred sales charge will not exceed 29% of  
premiums associated with the increase, up to one Guideline Annual Premium (for  
the increase), plus 9% of premiums associated with the increase in excess of one
Guideline Annual Premium, but less than the maximum number of Guideline Annual  
Premiums (for the increase) subject to the deferred sales charge. See HOW IS THE
SURRENDER CHARGE CALCULATED? The premiums associated with the increase are      
determined as described below.                                                  

Additional premium payments may not be required to fund a requested increase in 
the Face Amount. Therefore, a special rule, which is based on relative Guideline
Annual Premium payments, applies to allocate a portion of the existing Policy   
Value to the increase, and to allocate subsequent premium payments between the  
initial Policy and the increase. For example, suppose the Guideline Annual      
Premium is equal to $1,500 before an increase, and is equal to $2,000 as a      
result of the increase. The Policy Value on the effective date of the increase  
would be allocated 75% ($1,500/$2,000) to the initial Face Amount and 25% to the
increase. All future premiums also would be allocated 75% to the initial Face   
Amount and 25% to the increase. Thus, existing Policy Value associated with the 
increase will equal the portion of the Policy Value allocated to the increase on
the effective date of the increase, before any deductions are made. Premiums    
associated with the increase will equal the portion of the premium payments     
actually made on or after the effective date of the increase which are allocated
to the increase.                                                                

See the Statement of Additional Information for examples illustrating the       
calculation of the maximum surrender charge for the initial Face Amount and for 
any increases, as well as for the surrender charge based on actual premiums paid
or associated with any increases.

POSSIBLE SURRENDER CHARGE ON A FACE AMOUNT DECREASE                             

A surrender charge may be deducted on a decrease in the Face Amount. In the     
event of a decrease, the surrender charge deducted is a fraction of the charge  
that would apply to a full surrender of the Policy. The fraction will be        
determined by dividing the amount of the decrease by the current Face Amount and
multiplying the result by the surrender charge. If more than one surrender      
charge is in effect (i.e., pursuant to one or more increases in the Face Amount 
of a Policy), the surrender charge will be applied in the following order:      

-    the most recent increase;                                        

-    the next most recent increases successively, and                 

-    the initial Face Amount.                                         

Where a decrease causes a partial reduction in an increase or in the initial    
Face Amount, a proportionate share of the surrender charge for that increase or 
for the initial Face Amount will be deducted.                                   

WHAT CHARGES APPLY TO A PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL?                                     

Partial withdrawals of Surrender Value may be made after the first Policy year. 
The minimum withdrawal is $500. Under Option 1, the Face Amount is reduced by   
the amount of the partial withdrawal, and a partial withdrawal will not be      
allowed if it would reduce the Face Amount below $40,000.                       

A transaction charge, which is the smaller of 2% of the amount withdrawn or $25,
will be assessed on each partial withdrawal to reimburse the Company for the    
cost of processing the withdrawal. The Company does not expect to make a profit 
on this charge. The transaction fee applies to all partial withdrawals,         
including a Withdrawal without a surrender charge.                              

A partial withdrawal charge also may be deducted from the Policy Value. For each
partial withdrawal you may withdraw an amount equal to 10% of the Policy Value  
on the date the written withdrawal request is received by the Company less the  
total of any prior withdrawals in that Policy year which were not subject to the
Partial Withdrawal charge, without incurring a partial withdrawal charge. Any   
partial withdrawal in excess of this amount ("excess withdrawal") will be       
subject to the partial withdrawal charge. The partial withdrawal charge is equal
to 5% of the excess withdrawal up to the amount of the surrender charge(s) on   
the date of withdrawal. This right is not cumulative from Policy year to Policy 
year. For example, if only 8% of Policy Value were withdrawn in Policy year two,
the amount you could withdraw in subsequent Policy years would not be increased 
by the amount you did not withdraw in the second Policy year.                   

The Policy's outstanding surrender charge will be reduced by the amount of the  
partial withdrawal charge deducted by proportionately reducing the deferred     
sales charge component and the deferred administrative charge component. The    
partial withdrawal charge deducted will decrease existing surrender charges in  
the following order:                                                            

   -    first, the surrender charge for the most recent increase in the Face
Amount;                                                     

-    second, the surrender charge for the next most recent increases  
successively;                                               

-    last, the surrender charge for the initial Face Amount.          

WHAT ARE THE TRANSFER CHARGES?                                                  

The first 12 transfers in a Policy year will be free of charge. Thereafter, a   
transfer charge of $10 will be imposed for each transfer request to reimburse   
the Company for the administrative costs incurred in processing the transfer    
request. The Company reserves the right to increase the charge, but it never    
will exceed $25. The Company also reserves the right to change the number of    
free transfers allowed in a Policy year.

You may have automatic transfers of at least $100 a month made on a periodic    
basis:                                                                          

   -    from the Sub-Accounts which invest in the Goldman Sachs Money Market
       Fund and Goldman Sachs Government Income Fund to one or more of the
other Sub-Accounts; or                                      

-    to reallocate Policy Value among the Sub-Accounts.               

The first automatic transfer counts as one transfer towards the 12 free         
transfers allowed in each Policy year. Each subsequent automatic transfer is    
without charge and does not reduce the remaining number of transfers which may  
be made without charge.                                                         

If you utilize the Conversion Privilege, Loan Privilege or reallocate Policy    
Value within 20 days of the Date of Issue of the Policy, any resulting transfer 
of Policy Value from the Sub-Accounts to the General Account will be free of    
charge, and in addition to the 12 free transfers in a Policy year.              

WHAT IS THE CHARGE FOR AN INCREASE IN THE FACE AMOUNT?                          

For each increase in the Face Amount you request, a transaction charge of $40   
will be deducted from Policy Value to reimburse the Company for administrative  
costs associated with the increase. This charge is guaranteed not to increase   
and the Company does not expect to make a profit on this charge.                

ARE THERE ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES?                                     

The Company reserves the right to impose a charge guaranteed not to exceed $25, 
for the administrative costs incurred for changing the Net Premium allocation   
instructions, for changing the allocation of any Monthly Deductions among the   
various Sub-Accounts, or for a projection of values.                            

DOES THE COMPANY WAIVE CHARGES FOR ANY CLASSES OF POLICYOWNERS?                 

No surrender charges, partial withdrawal charges or front-end sales loads are   
imposed, and no commissions are paid where the Policy owner as of the date of   
application was within the following class of individuals:                      

All employees and directors of First Allmerica and its affiliates and 
subsidiaries, all employees and registered representatives of any     
 broker-dealer that had entered into a sales agreement with the Company,
   Security Distributors, Inc. or the former Principal Underwriter, VeraVest
Investments, Inc., to sell the Policies, and any spouses of the above 
persons or any children of the above persons.

FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The effect of federal income taxes on the value of the Policy, on loans,        
withdrawals, or surrenders, on death benefit payments, and on the economic      
benefit to you or the Beneficiary depends upon a variety of factors. The        
following discussion is based upon the Company's understanding of the present   
federal income tax laws as they currently are interpreted. From time to time    
legislation is proposed which, if passed, could significantly, adversely and    
possibly retroactively affect the taxation of the Policy. No representation is  
made regarding the likelihood of continuation of current federal income tax laws
or of current interpretations by the IRS. Moreover, no attempt has been made to 
consider any applicable state or other tax laws.                                

It should be recognized that the following summary of federal income tax aspects
of amounts received under the Policy is not exhaustive, does not purport to     
cover all situations, and is not intended as tax advice. Specifically, the      
discussion below does not address certain tax provisions that may be applicable 
if the Policyowner is a corporation or the Trustee of an employee benefit plan. 
A qualified tax adviser always should be consulted with regard to the           
application of law to individual circumstances.                                 

HOW ARE THE COMPANY AND THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT TAXED?                             

The Company is taxed as a life insurance company under Subchapter L of the Code 
and files a consolidated tax return with its parent and affiliates. The Company 
does not expect to incur any income tax upon the earnings or realized capital   
gains attributable to the Separate Account. Based on this, no charge is made for
federal income taxes which may be attributable to the Separate Account.         

Periodically, the Company will review the question of a charge to the Separate  
Account for federal income taxes. Such a charge may be made in future years for 
any federal income taxes incurred by the Company. This might become necessary if
the tax treatment of the Company ultimately is determined to be other than what 
the Company believes it to be, if there are changes made in the federal income  
tax treatment of variable life insurance at the Company level, or if there is a 
change in the Company's tax status. Any such charge would be designed to cover  
the federal income taxes attributable to the investment results of the Separate 
Account.                                                                        

Under current laws the Company also may incur state and local taxes (in addition
to premium taxes) in several states. At present these taxes are not significant.
If there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws, charges may
be made for such taxes paid, or reserves for such taxes, attributable to the    
Separate Account.                                                               

HOW ARE THE POLICIES TAXED?                                                     

The Company believes that the Policy described in this Prospectus will be       
considered a life insurance contract under Section 7702 of the Code, which      
generally provides for the taxation of life insurance policies and places       
limitations on premiums and the relationship of the Policy Value to the         
Insurance Amount at Risk. If a Policy qualifies as life insurance under Section 
7702 of the Code, (1) the Death Proceeds are excludable from the gross income of
the Beneficiary, and (2) any increase in the Policy Value is not taxable until  
received by the Policyowner or the Policyowner's designee. However, if a Policy 
fails to qualify as life insurance under Section 7702, the Policy will not      
provide most of the tax advantages normally provided by life insurance. The     
Company reserves the right to amend the Policies to comply with any future      
changes in the Code, any regulations or rulings under the Code and any other    
requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. Also see WHAT ARE MODIFIED
ENDOWMENT POLICIES AND HOW ARE THEY TAXED?, below.                              

Depending upon the circumstances, a surrender, partial withdrawal, change in the
Sum Insured Option, change in the Face Amount, lapse with Policy loan           
outstanding or assignment of the Policy may have tax consequences. In           
particular, under specified conditions, a distribution under the Policy during  
the first 15 years from Date of Issue that reduces future benefits under the    
Policy will be taxed to the Policyowner as ordinary income to the extent of any 
investment earnings in the Policy. Federal, state and local income, estate,     
inheritance, and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of Policy       
proceeds depend on the circumstances of each Insured, Policyowner or            
Beneficiary.                                                                    

45

P-->485APOS47th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�47th
If you surrender the Policy, you are subject to income tax on the portion of the
distribution that exceeds the investment in the contract. The investment in the 
contract is the gross Premiums paid for the Policy minus any amounts previously 
received from the Policy if such amounts were properly excluded from your gross 
income. Policy loans are generally not treated as taxable distributions.        
Interest paid on a Policy loan is generally not deductible. You are generally   
taxed on partial withdrawals to the extent the amount distributed exceeds the   
investment in the contract. In certain situations, partial withdrawals or       
reduction in benefits during the first fifteen years of the Policy may result in
a taxable distribution before the investment in the contract is recovered.      
Withdrawals and loans from modified endowment contracts are subject to less     
favorable tax treatment. For an additional discussion of modified endowment     
contracts, please see WHAT ARE MODIFIED ENDOWMENT POLICIES AND HOW ARE THEY     
TAXED?, below.                                                                  

If the Death Benefit is not received in a lump sum but is instead applied under 
one of the settlement options, payments generally will be prorated between      
amounts attributable to the Death Benefit, which will be excludable from the    
Beneficiary's income, and amounts attributable to interest (occurring after the 
Insured's death), which will be includable in the Beneficiary's income.         

If you are Owner and Insured under the Policy, the Death Benefit will be        
included in your gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. Even if the      
Insured is not the Owner but retains incidents of ownership in the Policy, the  
Death Benefit will also be included in the Insured's gross estate. Examples of  
incidents of ownership include the right to:                                    

-    change beneficiaries,                                                      

-    assign the Policy,                                                         

-    revoke an assignment,                                                      

-    pledge the Policy, or                                                      

-    obtain a Policy loan.                                                      

If you are Owner and Insured under the Policy, and you transfer all incidents of
ownership in the Policy, the Death Benefit will be included in your gross estate
if you die within three years from the date of the ownership transfer. State and
local estate and inheritance taxes may also apply. In addition, certain         
transfers of the Policy or Death Benefit, either during life or at death, to    
individuals two or more generations below the transferor may be subject to the  
federal generation skipping transfer tax. This rule also applies if the transfer
is to a trust for the benefit of individuals two or more generations below the  
transferor.                                                                     

The Policy may be used in various arrangements, including nonqualified deferred 
compensation or salary continuance plans, split dollar insurance plans,         
executive bonus plans, retiree medical benefit plans and others. The tax        
consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and       
circumstances of each individual arrangement. If you are contemplating the use  
of a Policy in any of these arrangements, you should consult a qualified tax    
adviser regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement.             

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added a new section to the Code that         
denies the tax-free treatment of death benefits payable under an                
employer-owned life insurance contract unless certain notice and consent        
requirements are met and either (1) certain rules relating to the insured       
employee's status are satisfied or (2) certain rules relating to the payment    
of the "amount received under the contract" to, or for the benefit of,          
certain beneficiaries or successors of the insured employee are satisfied.      
The new rules apply to life insurance contracts owned by corporations           
(including S corporations), individual sole proprietors, estates and trusts     
and partnerships that are engaged in a trade or business.  Any business         
contemplating the purchase of a Policy on the life of an employee should        
consult with its legal and tax advisors regarding the applicability of the      
new legislation to the proposed purchase.                                       

A tax adviser should also be consulted with respect to the 2003 split dollar    
regulations if you have purchased or are considering the purchase of a Policy   
for a split dollar insurance plan.  Any business contemplating the purchase     
of a new life insurance contract or a change in an existing contract should     
consult a tax adviser. There may also be an indirect tax upon the income in     
the Policy or the proceeds of a Policy under the federal corporate              
alternative minimum tax, if the policy owner is subject to that tax.            

HOW ARE POLICY LOANS TAXED?                                                     

The Company believes that non-preferred loans received under the Policy will be 
treated as an indebtedness of the Policyowner for federal income tax purposes.  
Under current law, these loans will not constitute income for the Policyowner   
while the Policy is in force (but see "Modified Endowment Policies"). There is a
risk, however, that a preferred loan may be characterized by the IRS as a       
withdrawal and taxed accordingly. At the present time, the IRS has not issued   
any guidance on whether loans with the attributes of a preferred loan should be 
treated differently than a non-preferred loan. This lack of specific guidance   
makes the tax treatment of preferred loans uncertain. In the event pertinent IRS
guidelines are issued in the future, you may convert your preferred loan to a   
non-preferred loan. However, it is possible that, notwithstanding the           
conversion, some or all of the loan could be treated as a taxable distribution  
from the Policy.                                                                

46

P-->485APOS48th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�48th
Section 264 of the Code restricts the deduction of interest on Policy loans.    
Consumer interest paid on Policy loans under an individually owned Policy is not
tax deductible. No tax deduction for interest is allowed on Policy loans        
exceeding $50,000 in the aggregate, if the Insured is an officer or employee of,
or is financially interested in, any business carried on by the taxpayer. There 
is an exception to this rule which permits a deduction for interest on loans up 
to $50,000 related to any business-owned policies covering officers or          
20-percent owners, up to a maximum equal to the greater of (1) five individuals,
or (2) the lesser of (a) 5% of the total number of officers and employees of the
corporation, or (b) 20 individuals.                                             

POLICIES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH TSA PLANS                                    

The Policies may be issued in connection with tax-sheltered annuity plans ("TSA 
Plans") of certain public school systems and organizations that are tax exempt  
under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.                                            

Under the provisions of Section 403(b) of the Code, payments made for annuity   
policies purchased for employees under TSA Plans are excludable from the gross  
income of such employees, to the extent that the aggregate purchase payments in 
any year do not exceed the maximum contribution permitted under the Code. The   
Company has received a Private Letter Ruling with respect to the status of the  
Policies as providing "incidental life insurance" when issued in connection with
TSA Plans. In the Private Letter Ruling, the IRS has taken the position that the
purchase of a life insurance Policy by the employer as part of a TSA Plan will  
not violate the "incidental benefit" rules of Section 403(b) and the regulations
thereunder. The Private Letter Ruling also stated that the use of current or    
accumulated contributions to purchase a life insurance Policy will not result in
current taxation of the premium payments for the life insurance Policy, except  
for the current cost of the life insurance protection.                          

A Policy qualifying under Section 403(b) of the Code must provide that          
withdrawals or other distributions attributable to salary reduction             
contributions (including earnings) may not begin before the employee attains age
59 1/2, separates from service, dies, or becomes disabled. In the case of       
hardship, a Policyowner may withdraw amounts contributed by salary reduction,   
but not the earnings on such amounts. Even though a distribution may be         
permitted under these rules (e.g., for hardship or after separation from        
service), it may nonetheless be subject to a 10% penalty tax as a premature     
distribution, in addition to income tax.                                        

Policy loans are generally permitted in accordance with the terms of the Policy.
However, if a Policy loan does not comply with the requirements of Code Section 
72(p), the Policyowner's TSA plan may become disqualified and Policy values may 
be includible in current income.                                                

WHAT ARE MODIFIED ENDOWMENT POLICIES AND HOW ARE THEY TAXED?                    

The Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 ("the 1988 Act") adversely  
affects the tax treatment of distributions under so-called "modified endowment  
contracts." A life insurance policy is treated as a modified endowment contract 
under Section 7702A of the Code if it meets the definition of life insurance in 
Section 7702, but fails the "seven-pay test" of Section 7702A. The Policy would 
fail to satisfy the seven-pay test if the cumulative premiums paid under the    
Policy at any time during the first seven Policy years (or within seven years of
a material change in the Policy) exceed the sum of the net level premiums that  
would have been paid, had the Policy provided for paid-up future benefits after 
the payment of seven level annual premiums. In addition, if benefits are reduced
at anytime during the life of the Policy, there may be adverse tax consequences.
Please consult your tax adviser.                                                

47

P-->485APOS49th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�49th
If the Policy is considered a modified endowment contract, the Death Benefit    
will still qualify for the exclusion from gross income, and increases in Policy 
value are not subject to current taxation unless withdrawn or otherwise         
accessed. However, all distributions under the Policy will be taxed on an       
"income-first" basis. Most distributions received by the Policyowner directly or
indirectly (including loans, withdrawals, surrenders, or the assignment or      
pledge of any portion of the Policy Value) will be includible in gross income to
the extent that the cash Surrender Value of the Policy exceeds the Policyowner's
investment in the Policy. Any additional amounts will be treated as a return of 
capital to the extent of the Policyowner's basis in the Policy. With certain    
exceptions, an additional 10% tax will be imposed on the portion of any         
distribution that is includible in income. All modified endowment contracts     
issued by the same insurance company to the same Policyowner during any calendar
period will be treated as a single modified endowment contract in determining   
taxable distributions.                                                          

Currently, each Policy is reviewed when premiums are received to determine if it
satisfies the seven-pay test. If the Policy does not satisfy the seven-pay test,
the Company will notify the Policyowner of the option of requesting a refund of 
the excess premium. The refund process must be completed within 60 days after   
the Policy anniversary, or the Policy will be classified permanently as a       
modified endowment contract.                                                    

WHAT ARE THE DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT?             

The Code also requires that the investment of each Sub-Account be adequately    
diversified in accordance with Treasury regulations in order to be treated as a 
life insurance Policy for tax purposes. Although the Company does not have      
control over the investments of the Funds, the Company believes that the Funds  
currently meet the Treasury's diversification requirements, and the Company will
monitor continued compliance with these requirements. In connection with the    
issuance of previous regulations relating to diversification requirements, the  
Treasury Department announced that such regulations do not provide guidance     
concerning the extent to which Policyowners may direct their investments to     
particular divisions of a separate account. Regulations in this regard may be   
issued in the future. It is possible that if and when regulations are issued,   
the Policy may need to be modified to comply with such regulations. For these   
reasons, the Policy or the Company's administrative rules may be modified as    
necessary to prevent a Policyowner from being considered the owner of the assets
of the Separate Account.                                                        

CAN I BE CONSIDERED THE OWNER OF THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS FOR TAX PURPOSES?  

The IRS has stated that you will be considered the owner of Separate Account    
assets if you possess incidents of ownership in those assets, such as the       
ability to exercise investment control over the assets. At the time the         
diversification regulations were issued, the Treasury Department announced that 
the regulations do not provide guidance concerning circumstances in which       
investor control of the Separate Account investments may cause an investor to be
treated as the owner of the Separate Account. The Treasury Department also      
stated that future guidance would be issued regarding the extent that owners    
could direct Sub-Account investments without being treated as owners of the     
underlying assets of the Separate Account.                                      

Your rights under this Policy are different than those described by the IRS in  
rulings in which it found that contract owners were not owners of Separate      
Account assets. For example, you have the choice to allocate Premiums and Policy
Values among more investment options. In addition, you may be able to transfer  
among investment options more frequently than in such rulings. These differences
could result in you being treated as the owner of the Separate Account. If this 
occurs, income and gain from the Separate Account assets would be includible in 
your gross income.                                                              

The Company does not know what standards will be set forth in any regulations or
rulings which the Treasury Department may issue. It is possible that future     
standards announced by the Treasury Department could adversely affect the tax   
treatment of your contract. We reserve the right to modify the Policy as        
necessary to attempt to prevent you from being considered the federal tax owner 
of the assets of the Separate Account. However we make no guarantee that such   
modification to the Policy will be successful.

 OTHER INFORMATION
ARE THERE OTHER IMPORTANT POLICY PROVISIONS?                                    

The following Policy provisions may vary in certain states in order to comply   
with requirements of the insurance laws, regulations and insurance regulatory   
agencies in those states.                                                       

POLICYOWNER                                                                     

The Policyowner is the Insured unless another Policyowner has been named in the 
application for the Policy. The Policyowner generally is entitled to exercise   
all rights under the Policy while the Insured is alive, subject to the consent  
of any irrevocable Beneficiary (the consent of a revocable Beneficiary is not   
required). The consent of the Insured is required whenever the Face Amount of   
insurance is increased.                                                         

BENEFICIARY                                                                     

The Beneficiary is the person or persons to whom the insurance proceeds are     
payable upon the Insured's death. Unless otherwise stated in the Policy, the    
Beneficiary has no rights in the Policy before the death of the Insured. While  
the Insured is alive, you may change any Beneficiary unless you have declared a 
Beneficiary to be irrevocable. If no Beneficiary is alive when the Insured dies,
the Policyowner (or the Policyowner's estate) will be the Beneficiary. If more  
than one Beneficiary is alive when the Insured dies, they will be paid in equal 
shares, unless you have chosen otherwise. Where there is more than one          
Beneficiary, the interest of a Beneficiary who dies before the Insured will pass
to surviving Beneficiaries proportionally, unless otherwise requested.          

INCONTESTABILITY                                                                

The Company will not contest the validity of the Policy after it has been in    
force during the Insured's lifetime for two years from the Date of Issue. The   
Company will not contest the validity of any increase in the Face Amount after  
such increase or rider has been in force during the Insured's lifetime for two  
years from its effective date.                                                  

SUICIDE                                                                         

The Death Proceeds will not be paid if the Insured commits suicide, while sane  
or insane, within two years from the Date of Issue. Instead, the Company will   
pay the Beneficiary an amount equal to all premiums paid for the Policy, without
interest, and less any outstanding Debt and any partial withdrawals. If the     
Insured commits suicide, while sane or insane, generally within two years from  
the effective date of any increase in the Sum Insured, the Company's liability  
with respect to such increase will be limited to a refund of the cost thereof.  
The Beneficiary will receive the administrative charges and insurance charges   
paid for such increase.                                                         

AGE AND SEX                                                                     

If the Insured's Age or sex as stated in the application for the Policy is not  
correct, benefits under the Policy will be adjusted to reflect the correct Age  
and sex, if death occurs prior to the Final Premium Payment Date. The adjusted  
benefit will be that which the most recent cost of insurance charge would have  
purchased for the correct Age and sex. In no event will the Sum Insured be      
reduced to less than the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured. In the case of a Policy 
issued on a unisex basis, this provision as it relates to misstatement of sex   
does not apply.                                                                 

ASSIGNMENT                                                                      

The Policyowner may assign the Policy as collateral or make an absolute         
assignment of the Policy. All rights under the Policy will be transferred to the
extent of the assignee's interest. The consent of the assignee may be required  
in order to make changes in premium allocations, to make transfers, or to       
exercise other rights under the Policy. The Company is not bound by an          
assignment or release thereof, unless it is in writing and is recorded at the   
Service Office. When recorded, the assignment will take effect as of the date   
the Written Request was signed. Any rights created by the assignment will be    
subject to any payments made or actions taken by the Company before the         
assignment is recorded. The Company is not responsible for determining the      
validity of any assignment or release.

CAN THE COMPANY DELAY PAYMENTS TO ME?                                           

Payments of any amount due from the Separate Account upon surrender, partial    
withdrawals, or death of the Insured, as well as payments of a Policy loan and  
transfers, may be postponed whenever: (1) the New York Stock Exchange is closed 
other than customary weekend and holiday closings, or trading on the New York   
Stock Exchange is restricted as determined by the SEC or (2) an emergency       
exists, as determined by the SEC, as a result of which disposal of securities is
not reasonably practicable or it is not reasonably practicable to determine the 
value of the Separate Account's net assets. Payments under the Policy of any    
amounts derived from the premiums paid by check may be delayed until such time  
as the check has cleared your bank.                                             

The Company also reserves the right to defer payment of any amount due from the 
General Account upon surrender, partial withdrawal or death of the Insured, as  
well as payments of Policy loans and transfers from the General Account, for a  
period not to exceed six months.                                                

DO I HAVE ANY VOTING RIGHTS?                                                    

To the extent required by law, the Company will vote Underlying Fund shares held
by each Sub-Account in accordance with instructions received from Policyowners  
with Policy Value in such Sub-Account. If the 1940 Act or any rules thereunder  
should be amended, or if the present interpretation of the 1940 Act or such     
rules should change and, as a result the Company determines that it is permitted
to vote shares in its own right, whether or not such shares are attributable to 
the Policy, the Company reserves the right to do so.                            

Each person having a voting interest will be provided with proxy materials of   
the respective Underlying Fund, together with an appropriate form with which to 
give voting instructions to the Company. Shares held in each Sub-Account for    
which no timely instructions are received will be voted in proportion to the    
instructions which have been received by the Company. The Company also will vote
shares held in the Separate Account that it owns and which are not attributable 
to the Policy in the same proportion.                                           

The number of votes which a Policyowner has the right to instruct will be       
determined by the Company as of the record date established for the Underlying  
Fund. This number is determined by dividing each Policyowner's Policy Value in  
the Sub-Account, if any, by the net asset value of one share in the             
corresponding Underlying Fund in which the assets of the Sub-Account are        
invested.                                                                       

We may, when required by state insurance regulatory authorities, disregard      
voting instructions if the instructions require that the Fund shares be voted so
as (1) to cause a change in the sub-classification or investment objective of   
one or more of the Funds, or (2) to approve or disapprove an investment advisory
contract for the Funds. In addition, the Company may disregard voting           
instructions that are in favor of any change in the investment policies or in   
any investment adviser or principal underwriter if the change has been initiated
by Policyowners or the Trustees. Our disapproval of any such change must be     
reasonable and, in the case of a change in investment policies or investment    
adviser, based on a good faith determination that such change would be contrary 
to state law or otherwise is inappropriate in light of the objectives and       
purposes of the Funds. In the event we do disregard voting instructions, a      
summary of and the reasons for that action will be included in the next periodic
report to Policyowners.                                                         

WHAT REPORTS WILL I RECEIVE CONCERNING MY POLICY?                               

The Company will maintain the records relating to the Separate Account.         
Statements of significant transactions such as premium payments, changes in     
specified Face Amount, changes in Sum Insured Option, transfers among           
Sub-Accounts and the General Account, partial withdrawals, increases in loan    
amount by you, loan repayments, lapse, termination for any reason, and          
reinstatement will be sent to you promptly. In addition, you will be sent       
periodic reports containing financial statements and other information for the  
Separate Account and the Underlying Funds as required by the 1940 Act.          

50

P-->485APOS52nd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�52nd
An annual statement also will be sent to you within 30 days after a Policy      
anniversary. The annual statement will summarize all of the above transactions  
and deductions of charges during the Policy year. It also will set forth the    
status of the Death Proceeds, Policy Value, Surrender Value, amounts in the     
Sub-Accounts and General Account, and any Policy loan(s).                       

The Owner should review the information in all statements carefully. All errors 
or corrections must be reported to the Company immediately to assure proper     
crediting to the Policy. The Company will assume that all transactions are      
accurately reported on confirmation statements and quarterly/annual statements  
unless the Owner notifies the Service Office in writing within 30 days after    
receipt of the statement.                                                       

ARE THERE ANY PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT?         

On July 24, 2002, an action captioned AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK AND TRUST COMPANY  
OF CHICAGO, AS TRUSTEE F/B/O EMERALD INVESTMENTS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, AND       
EMERALD INVESTMENTS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP V. ALLMERICA FINANCIAL LIFE INSURANCE   
AND ANNUITY COMPANY, was commenced in the United States District Court for the  
Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. In 1999, plaintiffs purchased  
two variable annuity contracts with initial premiums aggregating $5 million.    
Plaintiffs, who the Company subsequently identified as engaging in frequent     
transfers of significant sums between Sub-Accounts that in the Company's opinion
constituted "market timing", were subject to restrictions upon such trading that
the Company imposed in December 2001. Plaintiffs allege that such restrictions  
constituted a breach of the terms of the annuity contracts. In December 2003,   
the court granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs, holding that at   
least certain restrictions imposed on their trading activities violated the     
terms of the annuity contracts. (On September 1, 2006, Allmerica Financial Life 
Insurance and Annuity Company was renamed Commonwealth Annuity and Life         
Insurance Company).                                                             

On May 19, 2004, plaintiffs filed a Brief Statement of Damages in which, without
quantifying their damage claim, they outlined a claim for (i) amounts totaling  
$150,000 for surrender charges imposed on the partial surrender by plaintiffs of
the annuity contracts, (ii) loss of trading profits they expected over the      
remaining term of each annuity contract, and (iii) lost trading profits         
resulting from the Company's alleged refusal to process five specific transfers 
in 2002 because of trading restrictions imposed on market timers. With respect  
to the lost profits, plaintiffs claim that pursuant to their trading strategy of
transferring money from money market accounts to international equity accounts  
and back again to money market accounts, they have been able to consistently    
obtain relatively risk free returns of between 35% to 40% annually. Plaintiffs  
claim that they would have been able to continue to maintain such returns on the
account values of their annuity contracts over the remaining terms of the       
annuity contracts (which are based in part on the lives of the named            
annuitants). The aggregate account value of plaintiffs' annuities was           
approximately $12.8 million in December 2001. On February 1, 2006, the Court    
issued a ruling, which, as confirmed by the Court at a status conference on     
April 12, 2006, precludes plaintiffs from claiming any damages accruing beyond  
July 31, 2004.                                                                  

THG, on behalf of the Company, continues to vigorously defend this matter, and  
regards plaintiffs' claims for lost trading profits as being speculative and, in
any case, subject to an obligation to mitigate damages. Further, in the         
Company's view, these purported lost profits would not have been earned because 
of various actions taken, the investment management industry and regulators, to 
deter or eliminate market timing, including the implementation of "fair value"  
pricing.                                                                        

The outcome of this matter is not expected to be material to the Company's      
annual results of operations or financial position. In addition, THG has agreed 
to indemnify the Company and Goldman Sachs with respect to this litigation. A   
trial was held in December 2006, resulting in an award to plaintiffs of         
$1,281,757. Plaintiffs are expected to appeal.                                  

The Company is involved from time to time in judicial, regulatory and           
arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the       
conduct of its business. THG has agreed to indemnify the Company and Goldman    
Sachs with respect to certain of these matters as provided in the Stock Purchase
Agreement. Management believes, based on currently available information, that  
the results of such proceedings, in the                                         

51

P-->485APOS53rd�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�53rd
aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial   
condition, but may be material to the Company's operating results for any       
particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such      
period. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of the Company's
litigation and regulatory matters, particularly in cases or proceeding in which 
substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought, the Company cannot    
estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only
a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.                           

In addition, the Company is involved, in investigations and proceedings by      
governmental and self-regulatory agencies, which currently include inquiries    
relating to tax reporting calculations to policyholders and others in connection
with distributions under a subset of variable annuity contracts in this         
business. The Company believes that the result of these inquiries will not have 
a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.           

MAY THE COMPANY ADD, DELETE OR SUBSTITUTE FUNDS?                                

The Company reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to close Sub-accounts
to new investments or transfers, and to make substitutions for the shares that  
are held in the Sub-Accounts or that the Sub-Accounts may purchase. If the      
shares of any Underlying Fund are no longer available for investment or if in   
the Company's judgment further investment in any Underlying Fund should become  
inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Separate Account or the affected   
Sub-Account, the Company may redeem the shares of that Underlying Fund and      
substitute shares of another registered open-end management company. The Company
will not substitute any shares attributable to a Policy interest in a           
Sub-Account without notice to the Policyowner and prior approval of the SEC and 
state insurance authorities, to the extent required by law. The Separate Account
may, to the extent permitted by law, purchase other securities for other        
policies or permit a conversion between policies upon request by a Policyowner. 

The Company also reserves the right to establish additional Sub-Accounts of the 
Separate Account, each of which would invest in shares of a new Underlying Fund 
or in shares of another investment company. Subject to applicable law and any   
required SEC approval, the Company may, in its sole discretion, establish new   
Sub-Accounts or eliminate one or more Sub-Accounts if marketing needs, tax      
considerations or investment conditions warrant. Any new Sub-Accounts may be    
made available to existing Policyowners on a basis to be determined by the      
Company.                                                                        

If any of these substitutions or changes are made, the Company may endorse the  
Policy to reflect the substitution or change, and will notify Policyowners of   
all such changes. If the Company deems it to be in the best interest of         
Policyowners, and subject to any approvals that may be required under applicable
law, the Separate Account or any Sub-Account(s) may be operated as a management 
company under the 1940 Act, may be deregistered under the 1940 Act if           
registration is no longer required, or may be combined with other Sub-Accounts  
or other separate accounts of the Company.                                      

WHAT IS MIXED AND SHARED FUNDING?                                               

Shares of the Funds of the Trust also are issued to separate accounts of the    
Company and its affiliates which issue variable annuity contracts ("mixed       
funding"). Shares of the portfolios of the Underlying Funds also are issued to  
other unaffiliated insurance companies ("shared funding"). It is conceivable    
that in the future such mixed funding or shared funding may be disadvantageous  
for variable life Policyowners or variable annuity contract owners.             

Although the Company and the Underlying Investment Companies currently do not   
foresee any such disadvantages to either variable life insurance Policyowners or
variable annuity contract owners, the Company and the respective Trustees intend
to monitor events in order to identify any material conflicts and to determine  
what action, if any, should be taken. If the Trustees were to conclude that     
separate Funds should be established for variable life and variable annuity     
separate accounts, the Company will bear the expenses.                          

WHERE CAN I FIND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AND THE SEPARATE       
ACCOUNT?

Financial Statements for the Company and for the Variable Account are included  
in the Statement of Additional Information. The financial statements of the     
Company should be considered only as a bearing on our ability to meet our       
obligations under the Policy. They should not be considered as a bearing on the 
investment performance of the assets held in the Variable Account.

 THE GENERAL ACCOUNT

As discussed earlier, you may allocate Net Premiums and transfer Policy Value to
the General Account. Because of exemption and exclusionary provisions in the    
securities law, any amount in the General Account generally is not subject to   
regulation under the provisions of the 1933 Act or the 1940 Act. Accordingly,   
the disclosures in this section have not been reviewed by the SEC. Disclosures  
regarding the fixed portion of the Policy and the General Account may, however, 
be subject to certain generally applicable provisions of the federal securities 
laws concerning the accuracy and completeness of statements made in             
prospectuses.                                                                   

GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                                             

The General Account of the Company is made up of all the general assets of the  
Company other than those allocated to any separate account. Allocations to the  
General Account become part of the assets of the Company and are used to support
insurance and annuity obligations. Subject to applicable law, the Company has   
sole discretion over the investment of assets of the General Account.           

A portion or all of Net Premiums may be allocated or transferred to accumulate  
at a fixed rate of interest in the General Account. Such net amounts are        
guaranteed by the Company as to principal and a minimum rate of interest. The   
allocation or transfer of funds to the General Account does not entitle you to  
share in the investment experience of the General Account.                      

GENERAL ACCOUNT VALUES AND POLICY LOANS                                         

The Company bears the full investment risk for amounts allocated to the General 
Account, and guarantees that interest credited to each Policyowner's Policy     
Value in the General Account will be at an effective annual yield of 4.0%       
("Guaranteed Minimum Rate") compounded daily.                                   

The Company may, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, credit a higher rate of interest       
("excess interest"), although it is not obligated to credit interest in excess  
of 4%, and might not do so. The excess interest rate, if any, in effect on the  
date a premium is received at the Service Office, however, is guaranteed on that
premium for one year, unless the Policy Value associated with the premium       
becomes security for a Policy loan. AFTER SUCH INITIAL ONE-YEAR GUARANTEE OF    
INTEREST ON NET PREMIUM, ANY INTEREST CREDITED ON THE POLICY'S ACCUMULATED VALUE
IN THE GENERAL ACCOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE GUARANTEED MINIMUM RATE PER YEAR WILL BE
DETERMINED IN THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY. THE POLICYOWNER ASSUMES THE   
RISK THAT INTEREST CREDITED MAY NOT EXCEED THE GUARANTEED MINIMUM RATE.         

Even if excess interest is credited to accumulated value in the General Account,
no excess interest will be credited to that portion of the Policy Value which is
equal to the Debt. Such Policy Value, however, will be credited interest at an  
effective annual yield of at least 6%.                                          

The Company guarantees that, on each Monthly Payment Date, the Policy Value in  
the General Account will be the amount of the Net Premiums allocated or the     
Policy Value transferred to the General Account, plus interest at an annual rate
of 4%, plus any excess interest which the Company credits, less the sum of all  
Policy charges allocable to the General Account and any amounts deducted from   
the General Account in connection with loans, partial withdrawals, surrenders or
transfers.                                                                      

Policy loans also may be made from the Policy Value in the General Account.

effect. If the rider is in effect, the Death Proceeds will be greater of (a) the
Face Amount as of the Final Premium Payment Date or (b) the Policy Value as of  
the date due proof of death for Option 2 and date of death for Option 1 is      
received by the Company.                                                        

DEBT: all unpaid Policy loans plus interest due or accrued on such loans.       

DELIVERY RECEIPT: an acknowledgment, signed by the Policyowner and returned to  
the Company's Service Office, that the Policyowner has received the Policy and  
the Notice of Withdrawal Rights.                                                

EVIDENCE OF INSURABILITY: information, including medical information

FACE AMOUNT: the amount of insurance coverage applied for; the Face Amount of   
each Policy is set forth in the specification pages of the Policy.              

FINAL PREMIUM PAYMENT DATE: the Policy anniversary nearest the Insured's 95th   
birthday. The Final Premium Payment Date is the latest date on which a premium  
payment may be made. After this date, the Death Proceeds equal the Surrender    
Value of the Policy, unless the optional Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is in   
effect. The Net Death Benefit may be different before and after the Final       
Payment Date. See THE DEATH BENEFIT.                                            

GENERAL ACCOUNT: all the assets of the Company other than those held in a

GUIDELINE ANNUAL PREMIUM: the annual amount of premium that would be payable    
through the Final Premium Payment Date of a Policy for the specified Sum        
Insured, if premiums were fixed by the Company as to both timing and amount, and
monthly cost of insurance charges were based on the 1980 Commissioners Standard 
Ordinary Mortality Tables (Mortality Table B, Smoker or Non-Smoker, for unisex  
Policies), net investment earnings at an annual effective rate of 5%, and fees  
and charges as set forth in the Policy and any Policy riders. The Sum Insured   
Option 1 Guideline Annual Premium is used when calculating the maximum surrender
charge.                                                                         

GUIDELINE MINIMUM SUM INSURED: the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured required to    
qualify the Policy as "life insurance" under federal tax laws. The Guideline    
Minimum Sum Insured varies by age; it is calculated by multiplying the Policy   
Value by a percentage determined by the Insured's Age.

The percentage factor is a percentage that, when multiplied by the Certificate  
Value, determines the minimum death benefit required under federal tax laws. For
both the Option 1 and the Option 2, the percentage factor is based on the       
Insured's attained age, as set forth in GUIDELINE MINIMUM SUM INSURED TABLE     
under THE DEATH BENEFIT, WHAT ARE THE SUM INSURED OPTIONS?                      

INSURANCE AMOUNT AT RISK: the Sum Insured less the Policy Value.                

LOAN VALUE: the maximum amount that may be borrowed under the Policy.           

MINIMUM MONTHLY FACTOR: The Minimum Monthly Factor is a monthly premium amount  
calculated by the Company and specified in the Policy. If, in the first 48      
Policy months following Date of Issue or the effective date of an increase in   
the Face Amount or of a Policy Change which causes a change in the Minimum      
Monthly Factor:                                                                 

    -    You make premium payments (less debt, partial withdrawals and partial
        withdrawal charges) at least equal to the sum of the Minimum Monthly
        Factors for the number of months the Policy, increase in Face Amount
or Policy Change has been in force, and                     

-    Debt does not exceed Policy Value less surrender charges, then   

-    the Policy is guaranteed not to lapse during that period.        

EXCEPT FOR THE 48 POLICY MONTH PERIODS, MAKING MONTHLY PAYMENTS AT LEAST EQUAL  
TO THE MINIMUM MONTHLY FACTOR DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE POLICY WILL REMAIN IN 
FORCE.                                                                          

MONTHLY DEDUCTION: charges deducted monthly from the Policy Value of a Policy   
prior to the Final Premium Payment Date. The charges include the monthly cost of
insurance, the monthly cost of any benefits provided by riders, and the monthly 
administrative charge.                                                          

MONTHLY PAYMENT DATE: the date on which the Monthly Deduction is deducted from  
the Policy Value.                                                               

NET PREMIUM: an amount equal to the premium less a tax expense charge.          

POLICY CHANGE: any change in the Face Amount, the deletion of a rider, or a     
change in the Sum Insured Option.                                               

POLICY VALUE: the total amount available for investment under a Policy at any   
time. It is equal to the sum of (a) the value of the Accumulation Units credited
to a Policy in the Sub-Accounts, and (b) the accumulation in the General Account
credited to that Policy.                                                        

POLICYOWNER: the person, persons or entity entitled to exercise the rights and  
privileges under the Policy.                                                    

PREMIUM CLASS: the risk classification that the Company assigns the Insured     
based on the information in the application and any other Evidence of           
Insurability considered by the Company. The Insured's Premium Class will affect 
the cost of insurance charge and the amount of premium required to keep the     
Policy in force.

PRO-RATA ALLOCATION: In certain circumstances, you may specify from which       
Sub-Account certain deductions will be made or to which Sub-Account the Policy  
Value will be allocated. If you do not, the Company will allocate the deduction 
or Policy Value among the General Account and the Sub-Accounts in the same      
proportion that the Policy Value in the General Account (less Debt) and the     
Policy Value in each Sub-Account bear to the total Policy Value on the date of  
deduction or allocation.

depend on the Sum Insured Option chosen, but always will be at least equal to   
the Face Amount.

day during which no payment, partial withdrawal, or surrender of a Policy is    
received) when there is a sufficient degree of trading in an Underlying Fund's  
securities such that the current net asset value of the Sub-Accounts may be     
affected materially.

 GENERAL INFORMATION AND HISTORY

Effective September 1, 2006, Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Annuity     
Company was renamed Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company (the        
"Company"). The Company is a life insurance company organized under the laws of 
Delaware in July 1974. Prior to December 31, 2002, the Company was a wholly     
owned subsidiary of First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company ("First    
Allmerica)", which in turn was a direct subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance     
Group ("THG," formerly known as "Allmerica Financial Corporation"). Effective   
December 31, 2002, the Company became a Massachusetts domiciled insurance       
company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of THG. On December 30, 2005, THG  
completed the closing of the sale of the Company to The Goldman Sachs Group,    
Inc. ("Goldman Sachs"), 85 Broad Street, New York, NY 10004. The Company's      
principal office (the "Principal Office") was relocated to 132 Turnpike Road,   
Southborough, MA 01772, telephone 508-460-22400.                                

The Company is subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts         
governing insurance companies and to regulation by the Commissioner of Insurance
of Massachusetts. In addition, the Company is subject to the insurance laws and 
regulations of other states and jurisdictions in which it is licensed to        
operate. As of December 31, 2006, the Company and its subsidiaries had over $XX 
billion in assets and over $XX billion of life insurance in force.              

The VEL II Account of Commonwealth Annuity (the "Variable Account") is a        
separate investment account established on February 2, 1993. It meets the       
definition of "separate account" under federal securities laws, and is          
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as a unit        
investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act"). This    
registration does not involve SEC supervision of the management or investment   
practices or policies of the Variable Account or of the Companies. We reserve   
the right, subject to law, to change the names of the Variable Account and the  
sub-accounts.                                                                   

Several Sub-Accounts of the Variable Account are available under the VEL II     
contract (the "Contract"). Each Sub-Account invests in a corresponding          
investment portfolio:

 UNDERWRITERS AND DISTRIBUTION

Effective January 1, 2007, Security Distributors, Inc., a corporation organized 
and existing under the laws of the State of Kansas ("SDI" or "UNDERWRITER"), a  
registered broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member 
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), replaced      
VeraVest Investments, Inc. ("VeraVest," formerly Allmerica Investments, Inc.) as
principal underwriter and general distributor for the Contracts. SDI now serves 
as principal underwriter and general distributor for the Policy pursuant to a   
contract with the Company and the Variable Account. Security Distributors, Inc. 
is located at One Security Benefit Place, Topeka, Kansas 66636. The Policies    
were sold by agents of the Company who were registered representatives of       
VeraVest or of certain independent broker-dealers which are members of the NASD.
The Company has effectively ceased issuing new Policies.                        

The Company pays commissions to registered representatives who sold the Policy  
based on a commission schedule. After issue of the Policy or an increase in the 
Face Amount, commissions generally equal 50% of the first-year premiums up to a 
basic premium amount established by the Company. Thereafter, commissions        
generally will not exceed 5.3% of any additional premiums. However, we may pay  
higher amounts under certain circumstances.                                     

The Company intends to recoup the commission and other sales expense through a  
combination of the deferred sales charge component of the anticipated surrender 
and partial withdrawal charges, and the investment earnings on amounts allocated
to accumulate on a fixed basis in excess of the interest credited on fixed      
accumulations by the Company. There is no additional charge to Policyowners or  
to the Separate Account. Any surrender charge assessed on a Policy will be      
retained by the Company except for amounts it may pay to VeraVest. for services 
it performs and expenses it may incur as principal underwriter and general      
distributor.                                                                    

VeraVest Investments, Inc. ("VeraVest," formerly Allmerica Investments, Inc.)   
served as principal underwriter and general distributor for the Policy pursuant 
to a contract with the Company and the Variable Account until December 31, 2006.
The aggregate amounts of commissions paid to VeraVest for sales of all policies 
funded by the VEL II Account of Commonwealth Annuity for the years 2004, 2005   
and 2006 were $2,037,196.73, $812,126.66, and $[X,XXX,XXX]. No commissions were 
retained by VeraVest for sales of all contracts funded by the VEL II Account    
(including contracts not described in the Prospectus) for the years 2004, 2005  
and 2006. VeraVest is located at 440 Lincoln Street, Worcester, Massachusetts
01653.

 MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DEATH BENEFITS
GUIDELINE MINIMUM SUM INSURED                                                   

To remain qualified as "life insurance" for federal tax purposes, federal tax   
law requires that policies have a minimum amount of pure life insurance         
protection in relation to the size of the Policy Value. The Guideline Minimum   
Sum Insured is used to determine compliance with this requirement. So long as   
the Policy qualifies as a life insurance contract, the insurance proceeds will  
be excluded from the gross income of the Beneficiary.                           

The Policy provides two Sum Insured Options: Option 1 and Option 2, as described
below. You designate the desired Sum Insured Option in the application. You may 
change the Option once per Policy year by written request. There is no charge   
for a change in Option.                                                         

Under Option 1, the Sum Insured is equal to the greater of the Face Amount of   
insurance or the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured. Under Option 2, the Sum Insured 
is equal to the greater of the Face Amount of insurance plus the Policy Value or
the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured.                                              

 AGE OF INSURED                                  PERCENTAGE OF

95 and above                                        100%  

For the Ages not listed, the progression between the listed Ages is linear.     

Under both Option 1 and Option 2, the Sum Insured provides insurance protection.
Under Option 1, the Sum Insured remains level unless the applicable percentage  
of Policy Value under the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured exceeds the Face Amount,
in which case the Sum Insured will vary as the Policy Value varies. Under Option
2, the Sum Insured varies as the Policy Value changes.                          

For any Face Amount, the amount of the Sum Insured (and the Death Proceeds) will
be greater under Option 2 than under Option 1. This is because the Policy Value 
is added to the specified Face Amount and included in the Death Proceeds only   
under Option 2. Under Option 2, however, the cost of insurance included in the  
Monthly Deduction will be greater, and the rate at which Policy Value will      
accumulate will be slower (assuming the same specified Face Amount and the same 
actual premiums paid).                                                          

If you desire to have premium payments and investment performance reflected in  
the amount of the Sum Insured, you should choose Option 2. If you desire premium
payments and investment performance reflected to the maximum extent in the      
Policy Value, you should select Option 1.                                       

DEATH PROCEEDS                                                                  

As long as the Policy remains in force, upon due proof of the Insured's death,  
the Company will pay the Death Proceeds of the Policy to the named Beneficiary. 
The Company normally will pay the Death Proceeds within seven days of receiving 
due proof of the Insured's death, but the Company may delay payments under      
certain circumstances. The Death Proceeds may be received by the Beneficiary in 
cash or under one or more of the payment options set forth in the Policy.

P-->485APOS66th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�66th
Prior to the Final Premium Payment Date, the Death Proceeds are equal to:       

-    the Sum Insured provided under Option 1 or Option 2, whichever is
elected and in effect on the date of death; plus            

 -    any additional insurance on the Insured's life that is provided by
rider; minus                                                

   -    any outstanding Debt, any partial withdrawals and partial withdrawal
         charges, and any Monthly Deductions due and unpaid through the Policy
month in which the Insured dies.                            

After the Final Premium Payment Date, the Death Proceeds equal the Surrender    
Value of the Policy, unless the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is in effect. If 
the Guaranteed Death Benefit Rider is in effect, the Death Proceed equal the    
greater of the Face Amount or Surrender Value. The amount of Death Proceeds     
payable will be determined as of the date the Company receives due proof of the 
Insured's death for Option 2 and on the date of the Insured's death for Option  
1.                                                                              

EXAMPLES OF SUM INSURED OPTIONS                                                 

For the purposes of the following examples, assume that the Insured is under the
Age of 40 and that there is no outstanding Debt.                                

EXAMPLE OF OPTION 1                                                             

Under Option 1, the Face Amount of the Policy generally will equal the Sum      
Insured. If at any time, however, the Policy Value multiplied by the applicable 
percentage is less than the Face Amount, the Sum Insured will equal the Face    
Amount of the Policy.                                                           

For example, a Policy with a $50,000 Face Amount will generally have a Sum      
Insured equal to $50,000. Because the Sum Insured must be equal to or greater   
than 250% of Policy Value, however, if at any time the Policy Value exceeds     
$20,000, the Sum Insured will exceed the $50,000 Face Amount. In this example,  
each additional dollar of Policy Value above $20,000 will increase the Sum      
Insured by $2.50. For example, a Policy with a Policy Value of $35,000 will have
a Guideline Minimum Sum Insured of $87,500 ($35,000 X 2.50); Policy Value of    
$40,000 will produce a Guideline Minimum Sum Insured of $100,000 ($40,000 X     
2.50); and Policy Value of $50,000 will produce a Guideline Minimum Sum Insured 
of $125,000 ($50,000 X 2.50).                                                   

Similarly, so long as Policy Value exceeds $20,000, each dollar taken out of    
Policy Value will reduce the Sum Insured by $2.50. If, for example, the Policy  
Value is reduced from $25,000 to $20,000 (because of partial withdrawals,       
charges or negative investment performance), the Sum Insured will be reduced    
from $62,500 to $50,000.                                                        

The applicable percentage becomes lower as the Insured's Age increases. If the  
Insured's Age in the above example were, for example, 50 (rather than between 0 
and 40), the applicable percentage would be 185%. The Sum Insured would not     
exceed the $50,000 Face Amount unless the Policy Value exceeded $27,027 (rather 
than $20,000), and each dollar then added to or taken from Policy Value would   
change the Sum Insured by $1.85.                                                

EXAMPLE OF OPTION 2                                                             

Under Option 2, the Sum Insured is generally equal to the Face Amount of the    
Policy plus the Policy Value. The Sum Insured under Option 2, however, always   
will be the greater of:                                                         

-    the Face Amount plus Policy Value; or                            

-    the Policy Value multiplied by the applicable percentage from the
Guideline Minimum Sum Insured Table.                        

For example, a Policy with a Face Amount of $50,000 and with Policy Value of    
$5,000 will produce a Sum Insured of $55,000 ($50,000 + $5,000). Policy Value of
$10,000 will produce a Sum Insured of $60,000 ($50,000 + $10,000); Policy Value 
of $25,000 will produce a Sum Insured of $75,000 ($50,000 + $25,000).           

According to the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured Table, however, the Sum Insured  
for the example must be at least 250% of the Policy Value. Therefore, if the    
Policy Value is greater than $33,333, 250% of that amount will be the required  
Sum Insured, which will be greater than the Face Amount plus Policy Value. In   
this example, each additional dollar of Policy Value above $33,333 will increase
the Sum Insured by $2.50. For example, if the Policy Value is                   

7 

P-->485APOS67th�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�67th
$35,000, the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured will be $87,500 ($35,000 X 2.50);    
Policy Value of $40,000 will produce a Guideline Minimum Sum Insured of $100,000
($40,000 X 2.50); and Policy Value of $50,000 will produce a Guideline Minimum  
Sum Insured of $125,000 ($50,000 X 2.50).                                       

Similarly, if the Policy Value exceeds $33,333, each dollar taken out of the    
Policy Value will reduce the Sum Insured by $2.50. If, for example, the Policy  
Value is reduced from $45,000 to $40,000 because of partial withdrawals, charges
or negative investment performance, the Sum Insured will be reduced from        
$112,500 to $100,000. If at any time, however, Policy Value multiplied by the   
applicable percentage is less than the Face Amount plus Policy Value, then the  
Sum Insured will be the current Face Amount plus the Policy Value.              

The applicable percentage becomes lower as the Insured's Age increases. If the  
Insured's Age in the above example were 50, the Sum Insured must be at least    
1.85 times the Policy Value. The amount of the Sum Insured would be the sum of  
the Policy Value plus $50,000 unless the Policy Value exceeded $58,824 (rather  
than $33,000). Each dollar added to or subtracted from the Policy would change  
the Sum Insured by $1.85.                                                       

CHANGING BETWEEN SUM INSURED OPTIONS                                            

Generally, the Sum Insured Option in effect may be changed once each Policy year
by sending a Written Request for change to the Principal Office. Changing Sum   
Insured Options will not require Evidence of Insurability. The effective date of
any such change will be the Monthly Payment Date on or following the date of    
receipt of the request. No charges will be imposed on changes in Sum Insured    
Options.                                                                        

CHANGE FROM OPTION 1 TO OPTION 2                                                

If the Sum Insured Option is changed from Option 1 to Option 2, the Face Amount 
will be decreased to equal the Sum Insured less the Policy Value on the         
effective date of the change. This change may not be made if it would result in 
a Face Amount of less than $40,000. A change from Option 1 to Option 2 will not 
alter the amount of the Sum Insured at the time of the change, but will affect  
the determination of the Sum Insured from that point on. Because the Policy     
Value will be added to the new specified Face Amount, the Sum Insured will vary 
with the Policy Value. Under Option 2, the Insurance Amount at Risk always will 
equal the Face Amount unless the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured is in effect. The
cost of insurance also may be higher or lower than it otherwise would have been 
without the change in Sum Insured Option.                                       

CHANGE FROM OPTION 2 TO OPTION 1                                                

If the Sum Insured Option is changed from Option 2 to Option 1, the Face Amount 
will be increased to equal the Sum Insured which would have been payable under  
Option 2 on the effective date of the change (i.e., the Face Amount immediately 
prior to the change plus the Policy Value on the date of the change). The amount
of the Sum Insured will not be altered at the time of the change. The change in 
option, however, will affect the determination of the Sum Insured from that     
point on, since the Policy Value no longer will be added to the Face Amount in  
determining the Sum Insured; the Sum Insured will equal the new Face Amount (or,
if higher, the Guideline Minimum Sum Insured). The cost of insurance may be     
higher or lower than it otherwise would have been since any increases or        
decreases in Policy Value will reduce or increase, respectively, the Insurance  
Amount at Risk under Option 1. Assuming a positive net investment return with   
respect to any amounts in the Separate Account, changing the Sum Insured Option 
from Option 2 to Option 1 will reduce the Insurance Amount at Risk and therefore
the cost of insurance charge for all subsequent Monthly Deductions, compared to 
what such charge would have been if no such change were made.                   

A change in Sum Insured Option may result in total premiums paid exceeding the  
then-current maximum premium limitation determined by IRS rules. In such event, 
the Company will pay the excess to the Policyowner.

 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS
WAIVER OR REDUCTION OF CHARGES                                                  

The Company may waive or reduce the premium tax charge, administrative charges, 
surrender charge, or 5% partial withdrawal charge, and will not pay commissions 
on Policies, where the Insured is within the following class of individuals:    

All employees of First Allmerica and its affiliates and subsidiaries  
    located at First Allmerica's home office (or at off-site locations if such
   employees are on First Allmerica's home office payroll); all directors of
    First Allmerica and its affiliates and subsidiaries; all retired employees
     of First Allmerica and its affiliates and subsidiaries eligible under First
Allmerica Companies' Pension Plan or any successor plan; all General  
Agents, agents and field staff of First Allmerica; and all spouses,   
    children, siblings, parents and grandparents of any individuals identified
above, who reside in the same household.                              

CALCULATION OF MAXIMUM SURRENDER CHARGES                                        

A separate surrender charge is calculated upon issuance of the Policy and upon  
each increase in the Face Amount. The maximum surrender charge is equal to the  
sum of (a) plus (b), where (a) is a deferred administrative charge equal to     
$8.50 per $1,000 of initial Face Amount (or Face Amount increase), and (b) is a 
deferred sales charge of 49% of premiums received up to a maximum number of     
Guideline Annual Premiums (GAPs) subject to the deferred sales charge that      
varies by issue Age or Age at time of increase, as applicable:

A further limitation is imposed based on the Standard Nonforfeiture Law of each 
state. The maximum surrender charges upon issuance of the Policy and upon each  
increase in the Face Amount are shown in the table below. During the first two  
Policy years following issue or an increase in the Face Amount, the actual      
surrender charge may be less than the maximum. See CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS --    
"Surrender Charge."                                                             

The maximum surrender charge initially remains level and then grades down       
according to the following schedule:                                            

AGES                                                                            

0-50           The maximum surrender charge remains level for the first 40      
           Policy months, reduces by 0.5% for the next 80 Policy months,
             then decreases by 1% per month to zero at the end of 180 Policy
months (15 Policy years).                         

51 and above   The maximum surrender charge remains level for 40 Policy months  
     and decreases per month by above the percentages below:

Age 51 -- 0.78% per month for 128 months          
Age 52 -- 0.86% per month for 116 months          
Age 53 -- 0.96% per month for 104 months          
Age 54 -- 1.09% per month for 92 months           
Age 55 and over -- 1.25% per month for 80 months

EXAMPLES. For the purposes of these examples, assume that a male, Age 35,       
non-smoker purchases a $100,000 Policy. In this example the Guideline Annual    
Premium ("GAP") equals $1,118.22. His maximum surrender charge is calculated as 
follows:                                                                        

(a)  Deferred administrative charge                $  850.00          
($8.50/$1,000 of Face Amount)                               

(b)  Deferred sales charge                         $  909.95          
(49% X 1.660714 GAPs)                                       

TOTAL                                      $1,759.95  

Maximum surrender charge per Table (16.60 X 100)   $1,660.00          

11

P-->485APOS71st�Page�of�86TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�71st
During the first two Policy years after the Date of Issue, the actual surrender 
charge is the smaller of the maximum surrender charge and the following sum:    

(a)  Deferred administrative charge                        $850.00    
($8.50/$1,000 of Face Amount)                               

(b)  Deferred sales charge                                  Varies    
(not to exceed 29% of Premiums received,                    
up to one GAP, plus 9% of premiums                          
received in excess of one GAP, but                          
less than the maximum number of GAPs                        
subject to the deferred sales charge)                       

                                            Sum of (a) and (b)

The maximum surrender charge is $1,660. All premiums are associated with the    
initial Face Amount unless the Face Amount is increased.                        

EXAMPLE 1:                                                                      

Assume the Policyowner surrenders the Policy in the tenth Policy month, having  
paid total premiums of $900. The actual surrender charge would be $1,111.       

EXAMPLE 2:                                                                      

Assume the Policyowner surrenders the Policy in the 120th Policy month. After   
the 40th Policy month, the maximum surrender charge decreases by 0.5% per month 
($8.30 per month in this example.) In this example, the maximum surrender charge
would be $996.                                                                  

The Surrender charge is designed to partially reimburse us for the              
administrative costs of product research and development, underwriting, policy  
administration and for distribution expenses, including commissions to our      
representatives, advertising, and the printing of prospectuses and sales        
literature.

 PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

The Policy was first offered to the public in 1993. The Company may advertise   
"Total Return" and "Average Annual Total Return" performance information based  
on the periods that the Sub-Accounts have been in existence.                    

The returns in the tables reflect the charges assessed against the Separate     
Account (e.g., the mortality and expense risk charge and the administration     
charge) and all charges and expenses of the Underlying Funds. However, the tax  
expense charge, the charges that vary with each Policy because they are based on
certain factors that vary with the individual characteristics of the Insured    
(e.g., the Monthly Deduction and Surrender Charges), and transaction charges are
not reflected in the rates of return shown below. If these charges were         
deducted, the returns in the Tables would have been significantly lower. The    
tables do not illustrate how investment performance of the underlying funds will
affect policy values and benefits because they do not reflect deduction of all  
applicable policy charges.                                                      

In each table, "One-Year Total Return" refers to the total of the income        
generated by a Sub-Account, based on certain charges and assumptions as         
described in the respective tables, for the one-year period ended December 31,
2006. "Average Annual Total Return" is based on the same charges and            
assumptions, but reflects the hypothetical annually compounded return that would
have produced the same cumulative return if the Sub-Account's performance had   
been constant over the entire period. Because average annual total returns tend 
to smooth out variations in annual performance return, they are not the same as 
actual year-by-year results.                                                    

OTHER PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

Insurance Rating Services ("S&P") and Duff & Phelps. A.M. Best's and Moody's    
ratings reflect their current opinion of the Company's relative financial       
strength and operating performance in comparison to the norms of the life/heath 
insurance industry. S&P's and Duff & Phelps' ratings measure the ability of an  
insurance company to meet its obligations under insurance policies it issues do 
not measure the ability of such companies to meet other non-policy obligations. 
The ratings also do not relate to the performance of the Underlying Portfolios.

ITEM 29. PERSONS CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH THE DEPOSITOR OR THE
REGISTRANT 

The following are significant subsidiaries of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and 
the states or jurisdictions in which they are organized. Indentation indicates  
the principal parent of each subsidiary. Except as otherwise specified, in each 
case The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. owns, directly or indirectly, at least 99% of
the voting securities of each subsidiary. The names of particular subsidiaries  
have been omitted because, considered in the aggregate as a single subsidiary,  
they would not constitute, as of the end of the year covered by this report, a  
"significant subsidiary" as that term is defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation  
S-X under the Securities Act of 1934.                                           

 THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

  [All information will be filed by Post-Effective Amendment.]

These entities are directly or indirectly controlled (25% percent) by or under  
common control with Commonwealth Annuity.                                       

ITEM 30. INDEMNIFICATION 

RULE 484 UNDERTAKING - Article VI of the Company's Bylaws states: The           
Corporation shall indemnify to the full extent permitted by applicable law      
any person made or threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or         
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by        
reason of the fact that such person's testator or intestate is or was a         
director, officer or employee of the Corporation or serves or served at the     
request of the Corporation any other enterprise as a director, officer or       
employee. Expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by any such person in   
defending any such action, suit or proceeding shall be paid or reimbursed by    
the Corporation promptly upon receipt by it of an undertaking of such person    
to repay such expenses if such person if finally adjudicated not to have        
acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her action was in      
the best interest of the Corporation or other enterprise. The Corporation       
shall accept such undertaking without reference to the financial ability of     
such person to make repayment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no                
indemnification shall be provided for any person with respect to any matter     
as to which such person shall have been finally adjudicated not to have acted   
in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in best interests    
of the Corporation or other enterprise. No matter disposed of by settlement,    
compromise, the entry of a consent decree or the entry of any plea in a         
criminal proceeding, shall of itself be deemed an adjudication of not having    
acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best    
interest of the Corporation. The rights provided to any person by this by-law   
shall be enforceable against the Corporation by such person who shall be        
presumed to have relied upon it in serving or continuing to serve as            
director, officer or employee as provided above. No amendment of this by-law    
shall impair the rights of any person arising at any time with respect to       
events occurring prior to such amendment.

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 84 / Wednesday, May 3, 2017 / Notices

each Fund will have a specified
minimum number of Municipal
Securities holdings and will be subject
to percentage limitations on a Fund’s
total assets invested in Municipal
Securities of individual issuers, states
and sectors, as described above.
The proposed rule change is designed
to promote just and equitable principles
of trade and to protect investors and the
public interest in that the Exchange will
obtain a representation from the issuer
of the Shares that the NAV per Share
will be calculated daily and that the
NAV and the Disclosed Portfolio will be
made available to all market
participants at the same time. In
addition, a large amount of information
is publicly available regarding each
Fund and the Shares, thereby promoting
market transparency. Quotation and last
sale information for the Shares and
ETFs will be available via the CTA highspeed line, and from the national
securities exchange on which they are
listed. Prior to the commencement of
trading, the Exchange will inform its
Equity Trading Permit Holders in an
Information Bulletin of the special
characteristics and risks associated with
trading the Shares. Trading in Shares of
the Funds will be halted if the circuit
breaker parameters in NYSE Arca
Equities Rule 7.12 have been reached or
because of market conditions or for
reasons that, in the view of the
Exchange, make trading in the Shares
inadvisable. Trading in the Shares will
be subject to NYSE Arca Equities Rule
8.600(d)(2)(D), which sets forth
circumstances under which Shares of
the Funds may be halted. In addition, as
noted above, investors will have ready
access to information regarding the
Funds’ holdings, the IOPV, the
Disclosed Portfolio, and quotation and
last sale information for the Shares.
The proposed rule change is designed
to perfect the mechanism of a free and
open market and, in general, to protect
investors and the public interest in that
it will facilitate the listing and trading
of additional types of actively-managed
exchange-traded products that
principally hold municipal bonds and
that will enhance competition among
market participants, to the benefit of
investors and the marketplace. As noted
above, the Exchange has in place
surveillance procedures relating to
trading in the Shares and may obtain
information via ISG from other
exchanges that are members of ISG or
with which the Exchange has entered
into a comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement. In addition, as noted
above, investors will have ready access
to information regarding each Fund’s
holdings, IOPV, Disclosed Portfolio, and

quotation and last sale information for
the Shares.
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that
the proposed rule change will impose
any burden on competition that is not
necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purpose of the Act. The Exchange
notes that the proposed rule change will
facilitate the listing and trading of
additional types of actively-managed
exchange-traded products that
principally hold municipal bonds and
that will enhance competition among
market participants, to the benefit of
investors and the marketplace.
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Comments on the
Proposed Rule Change Received From
Members, Participants, or Others
No written comments were solicited
or received with respect to the proposed
rule change.
III. Date of Effectiveness of the
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for
Commission Action
Within 45 days of the date of
publication of this notice in the Federal
Register or within such longer period
up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may
designate if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its
reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which
the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:
(A) By order approve or disapprove
the proposed rule change, or
(B) institute proceedings to determine
whether the proposed rule change
should be disapproved.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The
following is a summary of the
application. The complete application
may be obtained via the Commission’s
Web site by searching for the file
number, or for an Applicant using the
Company name box, at http://
www.sec.gov.search/search.htm, or by

Applicants’ Representations
1. Commonwealth is a life insurance
company engaged in the business of
writing individual and group annuity
contracts and life insurance policies.
Commonwealth was originally
organized under the laws of Delaware in
July 1974 and was subsequently redomiciled in the state of Massachusetts
effective December 31, 2002.
2. Prior to December 30, 2005,
Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica
Financial Life Insurance and Annuity
Company) was an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of The Hanover
Insurance Group (‘‘THG’’), formerly
Allmerica Financial Corporation. On
that date, THG completed the closing of
the sale of Commonwealth to The
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (‘‘Goldman
Sachs’’). Effective September 1, 2006,
Commonwealth changed its name from
Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and

E:\FR\FM\03MYN1.SGM

03MYN1

20666

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 84 / Wednesday, May 3, 2017 / Notices

Annuity Company to Commonwealth
Annuity and Life Insurance Company.
Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs
completed the transfer of the common
stock of Commonwealth to Global
Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is a
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of
Global Atlantic Financial Group
Limited. Effective January 2, 2014,
Forethought Services LLC acquired
ownership of 79% of the shares of
Commonwealth. Forethought Services
LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Forethought Financial Group, Inc.,
which in turn is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin)
Company. As of December 31, 2015,
Goldman Sachs owns a total of
approximately 22% of the outstanding
shares of Global Atlantic; and other
investors, none of whom own more than
9.9%, own the remaining 78% of the
outstanding ordinary shares.

3. Each of the Separate Accounts
meets the definition of ‘‘separate
account,’’ as defined in Section 2(a)(37)
of the 1940 Act and Rule 0–1(e)
thereunder. The Separate Accounts are
registered with the Commission under
the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts.
The assets of the Separate Accounts
support the Contracts and interests in
the Separate Accounts offered through
such Contracts. Commonwealth is the
legal owner of the assets in the Separate
Accounts. The Separate Accounts are
segmented into subaccounts, and each
subaccount invests in an underlying
registered open-end management
investment company or a series thereof.
A subaccount of one or more of the
Separate Accounts corresponds to each
of the Existing Portfolios. The business
and affairs of the Separate Accounts, as
unit investment trusts, are conducted by
Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.

4. The Contracts are each registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the ‘‘1933 Act’’), on Form N–
4 or Form N–6, as applicable. Each of
the Contracts has particular fees,
charges, and investment options, as
described in the Contracts’ respective
registration statements.
5. The Contracts are individual or
group deferred variable annuity
contracts or variable life insurance
policies. As set forth in the prospectuses
for the Contracts, Commonwealth
reserves the right to substitute shares of
another registered investment company
for the shares of any registered
investment company already purchased
or to be purchased in the future by the
Separate Accounts.
6. Applicants propose, as set forth
below, to substitute shares of the
Replacement Portfolios for shares of the
Existing Portfolios (‘‘Substitutions’’):

investment advisory agreement between
the Trust, on behalf of each Global
Atlantic Fund, and Global Atlantic.
9. Each Replacement Portfolio is subadvised by BlackRock Investment
Management, LLC (‘‘BlackRock’’) or

December 31, 2015, GSAM, including
its investment advisory affiliates, had
assets under supervision of
approximately $1.08 trillion. GSAM’s
principal offices are located at 200 West
Street, New York, NY 20182.
10. The Applicants believe that the
Replacement Portfolios have investment
objectives, principal investment
strategies, and principle risks, as
described in their prospectuses, that are
substantially similar to, the
corresponding Existing Portfolios to
make those Replacement Portfolios
appropriate candidates as substitutes.
11. Information for each Existing
Portfolio and Replacement Portfolio,
including investment objectives,
principal investment strategies,
principal risks, and comparative
performance history, can be found in
the application.
12. Applicants state that in selecting
the Replacement Portfolios,
Commonwealth sought to simplify fund
lineups while reducing costs and
maintaining a high-quality menu of
investment options that would offer a
similar diversity of investment options
after the proposed Substitutions as is
currently available under the Contracts.
Contract owners with Contract value
allocated to the subaccounts of the
Existing Portfolios will have lower or
equal net annual operating expenses
immediately after the proposed
Substitutions as before the proposed
Substitutions. With respect to all of the
proposed Substitutions, the combined
management fee and Rule 12b–1 fees
paid by the Replacement Portfolio are
the same or lower than those of the
corresponding Existing Portfolio. The
application sets forth the fees and
expenses of each Existing Portfolio and
its corresponding Replacement Portfolio
in greater detail.
13. Applicants represent that as of the
Substitution Date (defined below), the
Separate Accounts will redeem shares of
the Existing Portfolios for cash or inkind. Redemption requests and
purchase orders will be placed
simultaneously so that Contract values
will remain fully invested at all times.
14. Each Substitution will be effected
at the relative net asset values of the
respective shares of the Replacement
Portfolios in conformity with Section
22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c–1
thereunder without the imposition of
any transfer or similar charges by the
Section 26 Applicants. The

PO 00000

Frm 00110

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

Substitutions will be effected without
change in the amount or value of any
Contracts held by affected Contract
owners.2
15. Contract owners will not incur
any fees or charges as a result of the
proposed Substitutions. The obligations
of the Section 26 Applicants, and the
rights of the affected Contract owners,
under the Contracts of affected Contract
owners will not be altered in any way.
Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will
pay all expenses and transaction costs of
the Substitutions, including legal and
accounting expenses, any applicable
brokerage expenses and other fees and
expenses. No fees or charges will be
assessed to the affected Contract owners
to effect the Substitutions. The proposed
Substitutions will not cause the
Contract fees and charges currently
being paid by Contract owners to be
greater after the proposed Substitution
than before the proposed Substitution.
In addition, the Substitutions will in no
way alter the tax treatment of affected
Contract owners in connection with
their Contracts, and no tax liability will
arise for Contract owners as a result of
the Substitutions.
16. The Section 26 Applicants agree
that, for a period of two years following
the implementation of the proposed
Substitution (the ‘‘Substitution Date’’),
and for those Contracts with assets
allocated to the Existing Portfolio on the
Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an
affiliate thereof (other than the Trust)
will reimburse, on the last business day
of each fiscal quarter, the Contract
owners whose subaccounts invest in the
applicable Replacement Portfolio to the
extent that the Replacement Portfolio’s
net annual operating expenses (taking
into account fee waivers and expense
reimbursements) for such period
exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net
annual operating expenses of the
2 The Section 26 Applicants state that, because
the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset
value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts
will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the
benefits offered by the guarantees under the
Contracts will be the same immediately before and
after the Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants
also state that what effect the Substitutions may
have on the value of the benefits offered by the
Contract guarantees would depend, among other
things, on the relative future performance of the
Existing Portfolios and Replacement Portfolios,
which the Section 26 Applicants cannot predict.
Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at
the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will
offer a comparable variety of investment options
with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.

Existing Portfolio for the most recent
fiscal year preceding the date of the
most recently filed application.
Commonwealth will not increase the
Contract fees and charges that would
otherwise be assessed under the terms
of the Contracts for a period of at least
two years following the Substitution
Date.
17. From the date the Pre-Substitution
Notice (defined below) through 30 days
following the Substitution Date,
Contract owners may make at least one
transfer of Contract value from the
subaccount investing in an Existing
Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the
Replacement Portfolio (after the
Substitution) to any other available
subaccount under the Contract without
charge and without imposing any
transfer limitations. Further, on the
Substitution Date, Contract values
attributable to investments in each
Existing Portfolio will be transferred to
the corresponding Replacement
Portfolio without charge and without
being subject to any transfer limitations.
Moreover, Commonwealth will not
exercise any rights reserved under the
Contracts to impose restrictions on
transfers between the subaccounts
under the Contracts, including
limitations on the future number of
transfers, for a period beginning at least
30 days before the Substitution Date
through at least 30 days following the
Substitution Date.
18. At least 30 days prior to the
Substitution Date, Contract owners will
be notified via prospectus supplements
that the Section 26 Applicants received
or expect to receive Commission
approval of the applicable proposed
Substitutions and of the anticipated
Substitution Date (the ‘‘Pre-Substitution
Notice’’). Pre-Substitution Notices sent
to Contract owners will be filed with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 497 under
the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution
Notice will advise Contract owners that
from the date of the Pre-Substitution
Notice through the date 30 days after the
Substitutions, Contract owners may
make at least one transfer of Contract
value from the subaccounts investing in
the Existing Portfolios (before the
Substitutions) or the Replacement
Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any
other available subaccount without
charge and without imposing any
transfer limitations. Among other
information, the notice will inform
affected Contract owners that that,
except as described in the disruptive
transfers or market timing provisions of
the relevant prospectus, Commonwealth
will not exercise any rights reserved
under the Contracts to impose
restrictions on transfers among the

VerDate Sep<11>2014

14:29 May 02, 2017

Jkt 241001

subaccounts under the Contracts,
including limitations on the future
number of transfers, through at least 30
days after the Substitution Date.
Additionally, all affected Contract
owners will be sent prospectuses of the
applicable Replacement Portfolios at
least 30 days before the Substitution
Date.
19. In addition to the Supplements
distributed to the Contract owners,
within five business days after the
Substitution Date, Contract owners
whose assets are allocated to a
Replacement Portfolio as part of the
proposed Substitutions will be sent a
written notice (each, a ‘‘Confirmation’’)
informing them that the Substitutions
were carried out as previously notified.
The Confirmation also will restate the
information set forth in the PreSubstitution Notice. The Confirmation
will also reflect the values of the
Contract owner’s positions in the
Existing Portfolio before the
Substitution and the Replacement
Portfolio after the Substitution.
Legal Analysis
1. The Section 26 Applicants request
that the Commission issue an order
pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940
Act approving the proposed
Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940
Act prohibits any depositor or trustee of
a unit investment trust that invests
exclusively in the securities of a single
issuer from substituting the securities of
another issuer without the approval of
the Commission. Section 26(c) provides
that such approval shall be granted by
order from the Commission if the
evidence establishes that the
substitution is consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes
of the 1940 Act.
2. The Section 26 Applicants submit
that the Substitutions meet the
standards set forth in Section 26(c) and
that, if implemented, the Substitutions
would not raise any of the concerns that
Congress intended to address when the
1940 Act was amended to include this
provision. Applicants state that each
Substitution protects the Contract
owners who have Contract value
allocated to an Existing Portfolio by
providing Replacement Portfolios with
substantially similar investment
objectives, strategies, and risks, and
providing Contract owners with
investment options that would have
total and net annual operating expense
ratios that are lower than, or equal to,
their corresponding investment options
before the Substitutions.
3. Commonwealth has reserved the
right under the Contracts to substitute
shares of another underlying fund for

PO 00000

Frm 00111

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

20669

one of the current funds offered as an
investment option under the Contracts.
The Contracts and the Contracts’
prospectuses disclose this right.
4. The Section 26 Applicants submit
that the ultimate effect of the proposed
Substitutions will be to streamline and
simplify the investment line-ups that
are available to Contract owners while
reducing expenses and continuing to
provide Contract owners with a wide
array of investment options. The Section
26 Applicants state that the proposed
Substitutions will not reduce in any
manner the nature or quality of the
available investment options and the
proposed Substitutions also will permit
Commonwealth to present information
to its Contract owners in a simpler and
more concise manner. The Section 26
Applicants also state it is anticipated
that after the proposed Substitutions,
Contract owners will be provided with
disclosure documents that contain a
simpler presentation of the available
investment options under the Contracts.
The Section 26 Applicants also assert
that the proposed Substitutions are not
of the type that Section 26 was designed
to prevent because they will not result
in costly forced redemption, nor will
they affect other aspects of the
Contracts. In addition, the proposed
Substitutions will not adversely affect
any features or riders under the
Contracts because none of the features
or riders have any investment
restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract
owner will involuntarily lose his or her
features or riders as a result of any
proposed Substitution. Moreover, the
Section 26 Applicants will offer
Contract owners the opportunity to
transfer amounts out of the affected
subaccounts without any cost or other
penalty (other than those necessary to
implement policies and procedures
designed to detect and deter disruptive
transfer and other ‘‘market timing’’
activity) that may otherwise have been
imposed for a period beginning on the
date of the Pre-Substitution Notice
(which supplement will be delivered to
the Contract owners at least thirty (30)
days before the Substitution Date) and
ending no earlier than thirty (30) days
after the Substitution Date. The
proposed Substitutions are also unlike
the type of substitution that Section
26(c) was designed to prevent in that the
Substitutions have no impact on other
aspects of the Contracts.
5. The Section 17 Applicants request
an order under Section 17(b) exempting
them from the provisions of Section
17(a) to the extent necessary to permit
the Section 17 Applicants to carry out
some or all of the proposed
Substitutions. The Section 17

E:\FR\FM\03MYN1.SGM

03MYN1

nlaroche on DSK30NT082PROD with NOTICES

20670

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 84 / Wednesday, May 3, 2017 / Notices

Applicants state that because the
proposed Substitutions may be effected,
in whole or in part, by means of in-kind
redemptions and purchases, the
proposed Substitutions may be deemed
to involve one or more purchases or
sales of securities or property between
affiliated persons.
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in
relevant part, prohibits any affiliated
person of a registered investment
company, or any affiliated person of
such person, acting as principal, from
knowingly selling any security or other
property to that company. Section
17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally
prohibits the persons described above,
acting as principals, from knowingly
purchasing any security or other
property from the registered investment
company.
7. The Section 17 Applicants state
that the proposed transactions may
involve a transfer of portfolio securities
by the Existing Portfolios to the Separate
Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the
Separate Accounts would purchase
shares of the Replacement Portfolios
with the portfolio securities received
from the Existing Portfolios.
Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants
provide that to the extent
Commonwealth and the Existing
Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the
Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to
be affiliated persons of one another
under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9)
of the 1940 Act, it is conceivable that
this aspect of the proposed
Substitutions could be viewed as being
prohibited by Section 17(a).
Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants
have determined to seek relief from
Section 17(a).
8. The Section 17 Applicants submit
that the terms of the proposed in-kind
purchases of shares of the Replacement
Portfolios by the Separate Accounts,
including the consideration to be paid
and received, as described in the
application, are reasonable and fair and
do not involve overreaching on the part
of any person concerned. The Section
17 Applicants submit that the terms of
the proposed in-kind transactions,
including the considered to be paid to
each Existing Portfolio and received by
each Replacement Portfolio involved,
are reasonable, fair and do not involve
overreaching principally because the
transactions will conform with all but
one of the conditions enumerated in
Rule 17a–7 under the 1940 Act. The
proposed transactions will take place at
relative net asset value in conformity
with the requirements of Section 22(c)
of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c–1
thereunder without the imposition of
any transfer or similar charges by the

VerDate Sep<11>2014

14:29 May 02, 2017

Jkt 241001

Section 26 Applicants. The
Substitutions will be effected without
change in the amount or value of any
Contract held by the affected Contract
owners. The Substitutions will in no
way alter the tax treatment of affected
Contract owners in connection with
their Contracts, and no tax liability will
arise for Contract owners as a result of
the Substitutions. The fees and charges
under the Contracts will not increase
because of the Substitutions. Even
though the Separate Accounts,
Commonwealth and the Trust may not
rely on Rule 17a–7, the Section 17
Applicants believe that the rule’s
conditions outline the type of
safeguards that result in transactions
that are fair and reasonable to registered
investment company participants and
preclude overreaching in connection
with an investment company by its
affiliated persons.
9. The Section 17 Applicants also
submit that the proposed in-kind
purchases by the Separate Accounts are
consistent with the policies of the Trust
and the Replacement Portfolios, as
provided in the Trust’s registration
statement and reports filed under the
1940 Act. Finally, the Section 17
Applicants submit that the proposed
Substitutions are consistent with the
general purposes of the 1940 Act.
Applicants’ Conditions
The Section 26 Applicants, and
Global Atlantic as applicable, agree that
any order granting the requested relief
will be subject to the following
conditions:
1. The Substitutions will not be
effected unless Commonwealth
determines that: (i) The Contracts allow
the substitution of shares of registered
open-end investment companies in the
manner contemplated by the
application; (ii) the Substitutions can be
consummated as described in the
application under applicable insurance
laws; and (iii) any regulatory
requirements in each jurisdiction where
the Contracts are qualified for sale have
been complied with to the extent
necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. After the Substitution Date, Global
Atlantic will not change a sub-adviser,
add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely
on the Manager of Managers Order (as
defined in the application), or any
replacement order from the
Commission, with respect to any
Replacement Portfolio without first
obtaining shareholder approval of the
change in sub-adviser, the new subadviser, or the Replacement Portfolio’s
ability to rely on the Manager of
Managers Order, or any replacement
order from the Commission.

3. Commonwealth or an affiliate
thereof (other than the Trust) will pay
all expenses and transaction costs of the
Substitutions, including legal and
accounting expenses, any applicable
brokerage expenses and other fees and
expenses. No fees or charges will be
assessed to the affected Contract owners
to effect the Substitutions. The proposed
Substitutions will not cause the
Contract fees and charges currently
being paid by Contract owners to be
greater after the proposed Substitution
than before the proposed Substitution.
4. The Substitutions will be effected
at the relative net asset values of the
respective shares of the Replacement
Portfolios in conformity with Section
22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c–1
thereunder without the imposition of
any transfer or similar charges by the
Section 26 Applicants. The
Substitutions will be effected without
change in the amount or value of any
Contracts held by affected Contract
owners.
5. The Substitutions will in no way
alter the tax treatment of affected
Contract owners in connection with
their Contracts, and no tax liability will
arise for Contract owners as a result of
the Substitutions.
6. The obligations of the Section 26
Applicants, and the rights of the
affected Contract owners, under the
Contracts of affected Contract owners
will not be altered in any way.
7. Affected Contract owners will be
permitted to make at least one transfer
of Contract value from the subaccount
investing in the Existing Portfolio
(before the Substitution Date) or the
Replacement Portfolio (after the
Substitution Date) to any other available
investment option under the Contract
without charge for a period beginning at
least 30 days before the Substitution
Date through at least 30 days following
the Substitution Date. Except as
described in any market timing/shortterm trading provisions of the relevant
prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants
will not exercise any rights reserved
under the Contracts to impose
restrictions on transfers between the
subaccounts under the Contracts,
including limitations on the future
number of transfers, for a period
beginning at least 30 days before the
Substitution Date through at least 30
days following the Substitution Date.
8. All affected Contract owners will be
notified, at least 30 days before the
Substitution Date about: (i) The
intended Substitution of Existing
Portfolios with the Replacement
Portfolios; (ii) the intended Substitution
Date; and (iii) information with respect
to transfers as set forth in Condition 7

E:\FR\FM\03MYN1.SGM

03MYN1

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 84 / Wednesday, May 3, 2017 / Notices
above. In addition, the Section 26
Applicants will also deliver to affected
Contract owners, at least thirty days
before the Substitution Date, a
prospectus for each applicable
Replacement Portfolio.
9. The Section 26 Applicants will
deliver to each affected Contract owner
within five business days of the
Substitution Date a written confirmation
which will include: (i) A confirmation
that the Substitutions were carried out
as previously notified; (ii) a restatement
of the information set forth in the PreSubstitution Notice; and (iii) values of
the Contract owner’s positions in the
Existing Portfolio before the
Substitution and the Replacement
Portfolio after the Substitution.
10. For a period of two years
following the Substitution Date, for
Contract owners who were Contract
owners as of the Substitution Date,
Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof
(other than the Trust) will reimburse, on
the last business day of each fiscal
quarter, the Contract owners whose
subaccounts invest in the applicable
Replacement Portfolio to the extent that
the Replacement Portfolio’s net annual
operating expenses (taking into account
fee waivers and expense
reimbursements) for such period
exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net
annual operating expenses of the
Existing Portfolio for the most recent
fiscal year preceding the date of the
application. In addition, the Section 26
Applicants will not increase the
Contract fees and charges that would
otherwise be assessed under the terms
of the Contracts for a period of at least
two years following the Substitution
Date.
For the Commission, by the Division of
Investment Management, under delegated
authority.

Each Exchange has requested that the
Commission grant it an exemption
pursuant to Section 36(a)(1) of the
Exchange Act, subject to the conditions
set forth below, with respect to its
‘‘Foreign Indirect Affiliates,’’ as defined
below, from the requirement under Rule
6a–2(b)(1) under the Exchange Act to
file the financial information required
by Exhibit D.
Each Exemption Request states that
the respective Exchange is a whollyowned subsidiary of NYSE Group, Inc.
(‘‘NYSE Group’’), a Delaware
corporation. Each Exemption Request
further states that NYSE Group is
wholly owned by NYSE Holdings LLC
(‘‘NYSE Holdings’’), a Delaware limited
liability company, which is wholly
owned by Intercontinental Exchange
Holdings, Inc. (‘‘ICE Holdings’’), a
Delaware corporation. In turn, ICE
Holdings is wholly owned by
Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (‘‘Parent
Company’’), a Delaware corporation.
The Parent Company, through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns a
large number of foreign entities, some of
which also own interests in other
foreign entities in excess of 25%.10 The
foreign entity affiliates and subsidiaries
of the Parent Company are referred to,
collectively, as the ‘‘Foreign Indirect
Affiliates.’’
Each Exchange states that, because of
the limited and indirect nature of its
7 Exhibit D to Form 1 requires that such financial
statements consist, at a minimum, of a balance
sheet and an income statement with such footnotes
and other disclosures necessary to avoid rendering
the financial statements misleading. Exhibit D
further provides that, if any affiliate or subsidiary
is required by another Commission rule to submit
annual financial statements, the exchange may
provide a statement to that effect, with a citation to
the other Commission rule, in lieu of the financial
statements required by Exhibit D.

Applicants' Representations

    1. Commonwealth is a life insurance company engaged in the business 
of writing individual and group annuity contracts and life insurance 
policies. Commonwealth was originally organized under the laws of 
Delaware in July 1974 and was subsequently re-domiciled in the state of 
Massachusetts effective December 31, 2002.
    2. Prior to December 30, 2005, Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica 
Financial Life Insurance and Annuity Company) was an indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group (``THG''), formerly 
Allmerica Financial Corporation. On that date, THG completed the 
closing of the sale of Commonwealth to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 
(``Goldman Sachs''). Effective September 1, 2006, Commonwealth changed 
its name from Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and

[[Page 20666]]

Annuity Company to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. 
Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs completed the transfer of the 
common stock of Commonwealth to Global Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is 
a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group 
Limited. Effective January 2, 2014, Forethought Services LLC acquired 
ownership of 79% of the shares of Commonwealth. Forethought Services 
LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forethought Financial Group, Inc., 
which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin) 
Company. As of December 31, 2015, Goldman Sachs owns a total of 
approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of Global Atlantic; and 
other investors, none of whom own more than 9.9%, own the remaining 78% 
of the outstanding ordinary shares.
    3. Each of the Separate Accounts meets the definition of ``separate 
account,'' as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act and Rule 0-
1(e) thereunder. The Separate Accounts are registered with the 
Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The assets of 
the Separate Accounts support the Contracts and interests in the 
Separate Accounts offered through such Contracts. Commonwealth is the 
legal owner of the assets in the Separate Accounts. The Separate 
Accounts are segmented into subaccounts, and each subaccount invests in 
an underlying registered open-end management investment company or a 
series thereof. A subaccount of one or more of the Separate Accounts 
corresponds to each of the Existing Portfolios. The business and 
affairs of the Separate Accounts, as unit investment trusts, are 
conducted by Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.
    4. The Contracts are each registered under the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended (the ``1933 Act''), on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as 
applicable. Each of the Contracts has particular fees, charges, and 
investment options, as described in the Contracts' respective 
registration statements.
    5. The Contracts are individual or group deferred variable annuity 
contracts or variable life insurance policies. As set forth in the 
prospectuses for the Contracts, Commonwealth reserves the right to 
substitute shares of another registered investment company for the 
shares of any registered investment company already purchased or to be 
purchased in the future by the Separate Accounts.
    6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of 
the Replacement Portfolios for shares of the Existing Portfolios 
(``Substitutions''):

    7. The Replacement Portfolios are all series of the Trust. The 
Trust is an insurance-dedicated Delaware statutory trust that was 
organized on June 17, 2013. The Trust is registered with the Commission 
as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act (File 
No. 811-22865) and its shares are registered under the 1933 Act (File 
No. 333-189870). The Trust is a series investment company and currently 
has 30 separate portfolios (each, a ``Global Atlantic Fund,'' and 
collectively, the ``Global Atlantic Funds''). The following 13 Global 
Atlantic Funds comprise the Replacement Portfolios: Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Allocation Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined 
Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Growth Portfolio, 
Global Atlantic BlackRock International Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Disciplined Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Small Cap Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock U.S. Core 
Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Value Portfolio, 
Global Atlantic BlackRock High Yield Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman 
Sachs Core Fixed Income Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Global 
Equity Insights Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Large Cap 
Growth Insights Portfolio, and Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Mid Cap 
Value Insights Portfolio.
    8. Global Atlantic, an Indiana limited liability company and a 
registered investment adviser, serves as investment adviser for each of 
the Global Atlantic Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement 
between the Trust, on behalf of each Global Atlantic Fund, and Global 
Atlantic.
    9. Each Replacement Portfolio is sub-advised by BlackRock 
Investment Management, LLC (``BlackRock'') or Goldman Sachs Asset 
Management, L.P. (``GSAM''). BlackRock is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock is a registered investment adviser and a 
commodity pool operator organized in Princeton, New Jersey. BlackRock, 
Inc. and its affiliates had approximately $4.64 trillion in assets 
under management as of December 31, 2015. BlackRock is located at 1 
University Square, Princeton, NJ 08536. GSAM is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and an affiliate of Goldman 
Sachs. As of December 31, 2015, GSAM, including its investment advisory 
affiliates, had assets under supervision of approximately $1.08 
trillion. GSAM's principal offices are located at 200 West Street, New 
York, NY 20182.
    10. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Portfolios have 
investment objectives, principal investment strategies, and principle 
risks, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially 
similar to, the corresponding Existing Portfolios to make those 
Replacement Portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes.
    11. Information for each Existing Portfolio and Replacement 
Portfolio, including investment objectives, principal investment 
strategies, principal risks, and comparative performance history, can 
be found in the application.
    12. Applicants state that in selecting the Replacement Portfolios, 
Commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and 
maintaining a high-quality menu of investment options that would offer 
a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed 
Substitutions as is currently available under the Contracts. Contract 
owners with Contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the Existing 
Portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses 
immediately after the proposed Substitutions as before the proposed 
Substitutions. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the 
combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Replacement 
Portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding 
Existing Portfolio. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of 
each Existing Portfolio and its corresponding Replacement Portfolio in 
greater detail.
    13. Applicants represent that as of the Substitution Date (defined 
below), the Separate Accounts will redeem shares of the Existing 
Portfolios for cash or in-kind. Redemption requests and purchase orders 
will be placed simultaneously so that Contract values will remain fully 
invested at all times.
    14. Each Substitution will be effected at the relative net asset 
values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in 
conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected 
Contract owners.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Section 26 Applicants state that, because the 
Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees 
and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the 
Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the 
Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the 
Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants also state that what effect 
the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by 
the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the 
relative future performance of the Existing Portfolios and 
Replacement Portfolios, which the Section 26 Applicants cannot 
predict. Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at the 
time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable 
variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return 
characteristics.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    15. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result 
of the proposed Substitutions. The obligations of the Section 26 
Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the 
Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way. 
Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will pay all expenses and 
transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting 
expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and 
expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract 
owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not 
cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract 
owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the 
proposed Substitution. In addition, the Substitutions will in no way 
alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with 
their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as 
a result of the Substitutions.
    16. The Section 26 Applicants agree that, for a period of two years 
following the implementation of the proposed Substitution (the 
``Substitution Date''), and for those Contracts with assets allocated 
to the Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an 
affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last 
business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose 
subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the 
extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses 
(taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such 
period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating 
expenses of the

[[Page 20669]]

Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date 
of the most recently filed application. Commonwealth will not increase 
the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under 
the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following 
the Substitution Date.
    17. From the date the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) 
through 30 days following the Substitution Date, Contract owners may 
make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount 
investing in an Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the 
Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution) to any other available 
subaccount under the Contract without charge and without imposing any 
transfer limitations. Further, on the Substitution Date, Contract 
values attributable to investments in each Existing Portfolio will be 
transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio without charge 
and without being subject to any transfer limitations. Moreover, 
Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts 
to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the 
Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for 
a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date 
through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
    18. At least 30 days prior to the Substitution Date, Contract 
owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the Section 26 
Applicants received or expect to receive Commission approval of the 
applicable proposed Substitutions and of the anticipated Substitution 
Date (the ``Pre-Substitution Notice''). Pre-Substitution Notices sent 
to Contract owners will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 
497 under the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution Notice will advise 
Contract owners that from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice 
through the date 30 days after the Substitutions, Contract owners may 
make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccounts 
investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the 
Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available 
subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer 
limitations. Among other information, the notice will inform affected 
Contract owners that that, except as described in the disruptive 
transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus, 
Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts 
to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the 
Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, 
through at least 30 days after the Substitution Date. Additionally, all 
affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable 
Replacement Portfolios at least 30 days before the Substitution Date.
    19. In addition to the Supplements distributed to the Contract 
owners, within five business days after the Substitution Date, Contract 
owners whose assets are allocated to a Replacement Portfolio as part of 
the proposed Substitutions will be sent a written notice (each, a 
``Confirmation'') informing them that the Substitutions were carried 
out as previously notified. The Confirmation also will restate the 
information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice. The Confirmation 
will also reflect the values of the Contract owner's positions in the 
Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement 
Portfolio after the Substitution.

Legal Analysis

    1. The Section 26 Applicants request that the Commission issue an 
order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed 
Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits any depositor or 
trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the 
securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of 
another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) 
provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the 
Commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is 
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the 
1940 Act.
    2. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the Substitutions meet the 
standards set forth in Section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the 
Substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that Congress 
intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include this 
provision. Applicants state that each Substitution protects the 
Contract owners who have Contract value allocated to an Existing 
Portfolio by providing Replacement Portfolios with substantially 
similar investment objectives, strategies, and risks, and providing 
Contract owners with investment options that would have total and net 
annual operating expense ratios that are lower than, or equal to, their 
corresponding investment options before the Substitutions.
    3. Commonwealth has reserved the right under the Contracts to 
substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current 
funds offered as an investment option under the Contracts. The 
Contracts and the Contracts' prospectuses disclose this right.
    4. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the 
proposed Substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the 
investment line-ups that are available to Contract owners while 
reducing expenses and continuing to provide Contract owners with a wide 
array of investment options. The Section 26 Applicants state that the 
proposed Substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or 
quality of the available investment options and the proposed 
Substitutions also will permit Commonwealth to present information to 
its Contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner. The Section 
26 Applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed 
Substitutions, Contract owners will be provided with disclosure 
documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available 
investment options under the Contracts. The Section 26 Applicants also 
assert that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that Section 
26 was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly 
forced redemption, nor will they affect other aspects of the Contracts. 
In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not adversely affect any 
features or riders under the Contracts because none of the features or 
riders have any investment restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract owner 
will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of 
any proposed Substitution. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will 
offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the 
affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than 
those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect 
and deter disruptive transfer and other ``market timing'' activity) 
that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date 
of the Pre-Substitution Notice (which supplement will be delivered to 
the Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution 
Date) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the 
Substitution Date. The proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type 
of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that the 
Substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts.
    5. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) 
exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent 
necessary to permit the Section 17 Applicants to carry out some or all 
of the proposed Substitutions. The Section 17

[[Page 20670]]

Applicants state that because the proposed Substitutions may be 
effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and 
purchases, the proposed Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or 
more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated 
persons.
    6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits 
any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any 
affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly 
selling any security or other property to that company. Section 
17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described 
above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or 
other property from the registered investment company.
    7. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed transactions 
may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing 
Portfolios to the Separate Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the 
Separate Accounts would purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios 
with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Portfolios. 
Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants provide that to the extent 
Commonwealth and the Existing Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the 
Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to be affiliated persons of one 
another under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act, it is 
conceivable that this aspect of the proposed Substitutions could be 
viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a). Accordingly, the Section 
17 Applicants have determined to seek relief from Section 17(a).
    8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed 
in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolios by the 
Separate Accounts, including the consideration to be paid and received, 
as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not 
involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 
17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind 
transactions, including the considered to be paid to each Existing 
Portfolio and received by each Replacement Portfolio involved, are 
reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because 
the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions 
enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions 
will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the 
requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contract held by the affected 
Contract owners. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax 
treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their 
Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a 
result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts 
will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though the 
Separate Accounts, Commonwealth and the Trust may not rely on Rule 17a-
7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the rule's conditions outline 
the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and 
reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude 
overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated 
persons.
    9. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind 
purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of 
the Trust and the Replacement Portfolios, as provided in the Trust's 
registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Finally, 
the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are 
consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.

Applicants' Conditions

    The Section 26 Applicants, and Global Atlantic as applicable, agree 
that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the 
following conditions:
    1. The Substitutions will not be effected unless Commonwealth 
determines that: (i) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of 
registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by 
the application; (ii) the Substitutions can be consummated as described 
in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (iii) any 
regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are 
qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to 
complete the Substitutions.
    2. After the Substitution Date, Global Atlantic will not change a 
sub-adviser, add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of 
Managers Order (as defined in the application), or any replacement 
order from the Commission, with respect to any Replacement Portfolio 
without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in sub-
adviser, the new sub-adviser, or the Replacement Portfolio's ability to 
rely on the Manager of Managers Order, or any replacement order from 
the Commission.
    3. Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will 
pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including 
legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and 
other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the 
affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed 
Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently 
being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed 
Substitution than before the proposed Substitution.
    4. The Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset 
values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in 
conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected 
Contract owners.
    5. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of 
affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax 
liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the 
Substitutions.
    6. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of 
the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract 
owners will not be altered in any way.
    7. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one 
transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in the 
Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution Date) or the Replacement 
Portfolio (after the Substitution Date) to any other available 
investment option under the Contract without charge for a period 
beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at 
least 30 days following the Substitution Date. Except as described in 
any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant 
prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants will not exercise any rights 
reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers 
between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on 
the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days 
before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the 
Substitution Date.
    8. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days 
before the Substitution Date about: (i) The intended Substitution of 
Existing Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios; (ii) the intended 
Substitution Date; and (iii) information with respect to transfers as 
set forth in Condition 7

[[Page 20671]]

above. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to 
affected Contract owners, at least thirty days before the Substitution 
Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio.
    9. The Section 26 Applicants will deliver to each affected Contract 
owner within five business days of the Substitution Date a written 
confirmation which will include: (i) A confirmation that the 
Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (ii) a 
restatement of the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution 
Notice; and (iii) values of the Contract owner's positions in the 
Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement 
Portfolio after the Substitution.
    10. For a period of two years following the Substitution Date, for 
Contract owners who were Contract owners as of the Substitution Date, 
Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will 
reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the 
Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement 
Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual 
operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense 
reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the 
net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for the most 
recent fiscal year preceding the date of the application. In addition, 
the Section 26 Applicants will not increase the Contract fees and 
charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the 
Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution 
Date.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.
Eduardo A. Aleman,
Assistant Secretary.
