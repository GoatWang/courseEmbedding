Habib Kairouz, Managing Partner  

Habib Kairouz is a managing partner of Rho Capital Partners and Rho Ventures as well as a member of the Investment Committees of Rho Canada Ventures and Rho Fund Investors. With over 20 years of experience in venture capital, Habib seeks to partner with entrepreneurs who are visionaries, hungry to build massive opportunities, confident enough to challenge established market leaders and charismatic enough to attract top-tier partners, customers and other business personnel.

                  Habib joined Rho in 1993 and focuses on investments in new media, information technology and communication companies at various stages of development – from seed stage to private equity. Prior to Rho, Habib worked in investment banking and leveraged buyouts in New York with Reich & Co. and Jesup & Lamont.

                  His interests also extend internationally to the impact of the Internet on globalization and its disruption of geopolitical boundaries, as well as solutions to the Middle East conflict. A native of Lebanon, Habib is involved with a number of nonprofit organizations focused on reforms and economic development there.

                  Habib has a passion for skiing and tennis. Habib received a B.S. in engineering and a B.A. in economics from Cornell University and an M.B.A. in finance from Columbia University. Follow Habib on Twitter, and connect with him on LinkedIn.
