Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)

Do More for Your Retirement With a Tax-advantaged IRA

IRA Selection Tool 






















It pays to invest in your future.

For a limited time, open a new qualifying PNC Investments account and you could get a cash bonus up to $1500.
Learn More


Special Offer









Why IRAs?






No matter how near or far off your retirement is, the tax advantages of an Individual Retirement Account can be too great to pass up. Using both an IRA and an employer-sponsored plan (such as a 401(k) if you have access to one) provides the opportunity to invest more for your retirement.










                        Traditional IRA
                    


                If you’ve earned income and are younger than age 70½, a Traditional IRA may be right for you.




Immediate tax advantages; contributions may be tax-deductible and earnings remain invested tax-deferred
Taxes are due at the time of distribution/withdrawal
No maximum income limits for eligibility


LEARN MORE





COMPARE IRAs












                        Roth IRA
                    


                If you’ve earned income below a certain threshold set by the IRS, a Roth IRA may be right for you.




Though contributions are made after-tax, earnings remain invested tax-free
Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement; there is no tax on qualified distributions after age 59½
May be more appropriate for those with growing income potential (who may be taxed at a lower rate now versus in retirement)


LEARN MORE





COMPARE IRAs












When Leaving an Employer




                If you're changing jobs or retiring, be sure to consider the assets you've accumulated in your employer-sponsored plan, such as a 401(k) plan.
            


There are four different actions you can take with assets invested via a previous employer’s retirement plan. These include leaving the assets where they are, moving the assets to a new employer’s plan, cashing out, and rolling the assets over to a Traditional or Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA).

Overview


Contracts with insurance companies designed to help meet long-range goals by providing a steady stream of income
Investors make lump-sum payments or a series of payments over time, then receive payments from the insurance company in return
Annuities allow for tax-deferred growth of your investment during the “accumulation” phase, then make periodic payments to you during the annuitization, or “payout,” phase
You decide the length of time you’d like to invest, as well as the frequency and duration of the payouts
Income payments can be structured for a term as short as three years or for as long as a lifetime
Contracts can be tailored to your risk tolerance and your need for income now or in the future
Frequently used for retirement planning
Can also be arranged to provide income and benefits for loved ones
All annuities are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company







Additional Information

Pricing & Fees
For customized pricing and fee information, please contact PNC Investments.

Before You Invest in Any Fund
Research the funds and fund families available through PNC Investments.

Carefully review the mutual fund prospectus(es) prior to investing. To request a prospectus, call 1-855-PNC-INVEST.





Mutual Fund Types




Indexed


Passively managed; designed to closely follow the performance of a specific market index by investing in stocks that make up the target index





Target Date


The term “target date” reflects the anticipated retirement age of the investor; i.e. a 2035 fund is appropriate for individuals planning to retire in 2035
The fund’s investment mix adjusts over time, favoring stocks when the target date is well into the future – and becoming more conservative with a higher weighting toward bonds as the target date approaches
Changing allocation mix is called the “glide path”






Asset Allocation / Risk-Based


Achieve portfolio diversification with a single fund
Invest in a mix of equities, fixed income and cash that matches a specific risk tolerance (choose conservative, moderate or aggressive)
Underlying investments could be other mutual funds (this is called a fund of funds)





Load / No-Load


Loaded mutual funds charge sales fees: either a front-end charge at the time of purchase, a back-end charge when the fund is sold, or a level charge that must be paid each year
Loaded mutual funds typically include an annual expense fee, as well
No-load mutual funds do not charge sales fees at the time of purchase, but typically still include an annual expense fee
No-load funds may be charged transaction fees on purchases









Understanding Asset Allocation











Determining the mix of investment types is one of your most important tasks as an investor.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 856 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.





3 Yrs





                         Out of

                         Out of
540
 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns

HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Above Average because they fall between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks current income as well as preservation of capital.




Strategy



The fund invests primarily in a diversified portfolio of investment-grade fixed income securities. The dollar-weighted average maturity of the fund's portfolio is normally expected to range from four to twelve years, but may vary outside that range from time to time, including due to market conditions or if deemed appropriate for temporary defensive purposes. Under normal circumstances, it invests at least 80% of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in investment-grade fixed income securities (bonds).


Risk



In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
Weighted average maturity (WAM) is the weighted average of all the maturities of the securities held in a fund. WAM for money market funds can be used as a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes. Generally, the longer the maturity, the greater the sensitivity. WAM for money market funds is based on the dollar-weighted average length of time until principal payments must be paid, taking into account any call options exercised by the issuer and any permissible maturity shortening devices, such as demand features and interest rate resets. For bond funds, WAM can be used as a measure of sensitivity to the markets. Generally, the longer the maturity, the greater the sensitivity. The WAM calculation for bond funds excludes interest rate resets and only takes into account issuer call options if it is probable that the issuer of the instrument will take advantage of such options.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit  and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. The current yield reflects the current earnings of the fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year and that dividends are reinvested. It is the Fund's total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement.
7. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
8. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
9. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
10. Fixed Income StyleMap� StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 9/28/2017 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.
