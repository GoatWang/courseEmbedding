					About us	

HomeAbout us 







SOME Words About Us
It all started with trying to purchase a picture.
The creators of Tech Central were simply trying to purchase a picture for a website when they realized soooo many people use the same ideas. Why not be original?



So we started a branch off of our website and app building services to create, buy and sell videos and photography for online use such as ads. Not just any videos though, we specialize in high quality and targeted videos to help make your site or app look as special as it is.
We're very excited about what we do here, contact us to learn more.
Our RULES


STAND OUT
Media created by Tech Central must always stand out and be original high quality.
TRUSTWORTHY
Earn your clients trust by always exceeding their goals.
EASY
All media created must be easy to understand across all demographics.




Our amazing team
We want clients to know we have the staff to make their website or app succeed.

The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from
the resale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the
registration of the shares for the selling security holders.


We provide solutions that enable individuals, businesses and organizations to
establish an online presence, connect with customers and manage their ventures.
The market for providing these solutions is highly fragmented with some vendors
providing part of the solution, and others providing a total solution. These
solutions are rapidly evolving, creating opportunity for new competitors to
enter the market with newly developed product solutions or by addressing
specific segments of the market.

Competition within media providers include:

. Traditional media solutions such as Television Ads

. Website creation and management solutions and providers such as Wix and 
  WordPress

. Alternative web content providers such as Pond5, istockphoto, and google 
  images

Competition within web content and app development include sites such as:

. WebSitePros

. Iwebdev

. Godaddy

. Website.com

. Various Local Web Developers

We expect ever increasing competition from competitors in the content and
presence markets, as well as potential increased competition from companies like
Amazon, Google and Microsoft, all of which are providers of internet services
which also sell visual content.

We believe the principal competitive factors to include: product capabilities
that meet customer requirements, a secure, reliable and integrated technology
platform, cost-effective customer acquisition, brand awareness and reputation,
customer service and support and overall customer satisfaction. We believe that
we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.

by controlling production costs and by limiting its distribution expenses using,
