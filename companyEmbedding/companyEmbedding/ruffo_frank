You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Hendricks Property Management LLCrlewis896 ratedIt has been a pleasure to be a tenant of Hendricks from day one. The whole team has been very easy to deal with, and super responsive with issues. From the office staff to the maintenance guys, you'll find nothing but helpful people you can rely on. Even their website is great, and makes paying rent online a breeze. As someone who has rented for almost 10 years, across various cities and states, from private owners, other management companies, and huge corporate high-rises, I can easily say Hendricks Property Services is one of the best.Davidson Properties Incappleblossom1980 ratedThe staff has been very polite and helpful. We needed to move immediately and they were willing to work with us to get us in quick and easy. They emailed us the lease and we went through the whole process electronically which was soo convenient. The house is in good shape, but we've had a few maintenance issues since moving in (primarily AC) and they have been quick to get the problems fixed ---still getting used to the Texas heat, lol. We're very happy and hope to be here for a few years. Good neighborhood, good schools.Hendricks Property Management LLCJerry F. ratedI have been working with Karen from the beginning and she has been a true professional and personifies what great customer care and service should be in the property management industry. Her responsiveness and skill in handling situations dealing with difficult tenants has been phenomenal. She has personally guided me through those difficult times with great care and tact. I hope Hendricks will continue to be at least as strong and successful as they are today.Terra Realty & Management Group IncDaniel W. ratedTerra Realty & Management Group is the best management company in San Antonio. They are very affordable and they take great care of my rentals. I let them deal with the tenants so I don't have to, they only contact me if there is a big issue that I need to be aware of. I get monthly electronic statements with a full accounting of what happened that month. At tax time, I simply print out their year end statement and give that to my accountant.Hendricks Property Management LLCmartyyost0 ratedHendricks Property Management is really easy to deal with.  They are very direct and down to earth, yet friendly and always ready to help.  They understand that it is best to deal with potential problems before they happen, rather than rushing around to solve things after they happen.  He also sees the tenants as real people and deals with them that way, rather than viewing them as potential adversaries. They’ve always been up front with me.Hallada Property ManagementLinds S. ratedHorrible customer service. They will get around to taking care of maintenence only when you hound them to death. My home owner doesn't want to pay for vents to be cleaned because it isn't federally regulated. I payed for it, $450. Hallada had to be called 3x and I still haven't received an answer whether or not the owner would cover the expense. I was tired of my fam having on and off sinus trouble for a year and a half. Davidson Properties IncCilla W. ratedI don't have a single bad thing to say about Davidson Properties! We love the house we are renting, we love the neighborhood, and the price is right! We deal with Ashley in the office for maintenance requests and she has been a doll! Actually, all the ladies have been great and super sweet -- they always have smiles on their faces! We will definitely be renewing our lease in the spring. Thank you!Hendricks Property Management LLCchelseabrookston99 ratedI am particularly happy with this property management company.  They are respectful, give good advice, handle problems promptly and know what they are doing.  When I came down to San Antonio and contacted them at the last minute they managed to find the time to meet with me and show me the houses even though it was the beginning of a holiday weekend.  Thanks for going above and beyond.Hendricks Property Management LLCDean F. ratedThe long commitment they have with me and I have with them, I am not shuffled around to a different property manager every year or so. I love that Cathi has been my property manager for many years and hope she continues to be. I choose them when they were starting out and been with them every since from a friend that was working there.
