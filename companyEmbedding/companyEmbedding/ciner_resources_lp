Soda Ash		


superadm1n1strator 


2017-04-24T22:41:50+00:00		

Soda ash, known chemically as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), has been in use for thousands of years. Soda ash occurs in many kinds of mineral waters and in mineral deposits of certain springs and lake brines. The richest and most commonly found source of soda ash is trona, a mix of sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, and water. Although trona can be found in many places, the world’s purest, largest, and most accessible deposit is in Wyoming’s Green River Basin.
A Leading Global Producer of Natural Soda Ash
At Ciner Wyoming’s 3.25 million ton facility, trona is mined using the “Room and Pillar Method” and conveyed to the surface to be refined into dense soda ash. Quality control is maintained through detailed instrumentation, laboratory testing, and rigid supervision. Our extensive industry experience, knowledgeable staff, modern laboratories, ISO 9001 (2008 Standard) certification, and highly efficient processing facilities combine to supply Ciner customers with superior service and support.
For more information on any of our products or services, please contact our Customer Service Team at (800) 865-1774 or custserv@ciner.us.com.
Soda ash is used in a variety of industries and applications including:


Glass Manufacturing
Dry Powder Detergents
(e.g. laundry, auto dish, etc.)
Pulp Processing
pH Control
Specialty Chemicals Manufacturing
(e.g. phosphates, chromium, etc.)
Food Manufacturing
(e.g. yeast, baking soda, etc.)


HISTORY OF SODA ASH



About 50 million years ago, volcanic activity, decaying plant matter, and climate change caused the evaporation of a large lake, leaving behind the world’s largest trona deposit located in Green River, Wyoming.



Ancient Egyptians dug up dry lakebed deposits, using soda ash to make glass ornaments and vessels.


Romans used soda ash for baking bread, making glass, and medicinal purposes.



Soda ash has been used in manufacturing for over 5,000 years.




Up until the 19th century, soda ash was extracted from the ashes of plants that grew in sodium- rich soil. The method was so common, it is how the powder received the name ‘soda ash.’



Now mined from trona deposits, soda ash is one of the world’s most abundant natural resources.




Soda ash is one of the most widely used and important commodities in the U.S.


HOW IS SODA ASH USED?
When processed, soda ash can vary in density, size, and shape. This flexibility allows it to be used in a variety of everyday products. From bathtubs and baked goods to office building windows and internet cables, some common examples are listed below.
NATURAL vs. SYNTHETIC

Synthetic soda ash is made using either the Solvay or Hou process and contains a number of different chemicals. Both methods leave behind byproducts and require either seaside discharge or waste beds to catch leftover impurities. These impurities have led to water pollution and overall deterioration of the surrounding environment.
Unlike the synthetic Solvay and Hou processes, Ciner uses an all-natural mining system. Our soda ash is mined from the ground and refined with no additional chemicals. The Ciner method is environmentally friendly and produces a pure, high-quality product. Our all-natural approach keeps costs low, allowing us to distribute Ciner soda ash all over the world in a cost-effective and competitive manner.

 

Bulk Soda Ash
We recommend epoxy-lined steel storage bins. If the granular nature of the ash is intact after conveying and elevating, there should be no problems with the material bridging or hanging up in storage. Ensuring the cone at the bottom is at a 45-55 degree angle from the horizontal is strongly advised. Storage bin capacity should be figured at 55 lb per cubic foot, although Ciner soda ash normally runs closer to 60 lb per cubic foot. If the storage bin is designed with a sufficient bottom slope, vibration should not be necessary. What’s more, vibration is undesirable, as it promotes segregation and classification of the particle sizes.



Soda Ash Solution
These solutions are generally stored in a tank. Soda ash is inversely soluble above 95.7°F; that is, as the temperature falls, more material goes into the solution. Solubility reaches a maximum of 32.3% soda ash by weight at this inflection point (95.7°F) and then falls steeply with decreasing temperature. Since the presence of soda ash crystals is unacceptable in most processes, the concentration of a substantial amount of solution will require an excessive tankage volume. Example: Adding 100 tons of soda ash to water to make a 25% solution by weight requires about 85,000 gallons of tankage.

Soda Ash Slurry
An alternative to large volume tankage is a slurry storage system that consists of a tank, a device for slurrying the dry bulk soda ash and transferring it to the storage tank (slurrifier), and a method for reclaiming the solution from the common tank. To slurry a 100-ton hopper car of soda ash to a 70% solids slurry requires a tank about the same size as dry bulk storage. Slurries of up to 90% solids are easily stored.

Bagged Soda Ash
Bagged soda ash that is stored in a warehouse environment free from excessive humidity or moisture should present no problems. However, if proper inventory management practices such as “FIFO” (First In, First Out) are not applied or the product is exposed to high levels of humidity or moisture, some caking of material is possible.



Safety Precautions for Soda Ash Handling
Although not listed as a hazardous substance, soda ash is primarily a skin irritant. Dusts or mists containing soda ash are moderately irritating to the mucous membranes of the nose and eyes. The irritation is temporary, however, and symptoms usually disappear shortly after contact ends. Eyes and skin should be flushed with water if exposed. A physician should treat prolonged irritation.
Protective clothing, goggles, and respirators should be used if soda ash in the air exceeds nuisance dust levels. Dusty clothing should be washed before exposure to other compounds. In extreme cases, mixtures of soda ash and lime may produce caustic soda in the presence of perspiration, which may be irritating. Workers in soda ash storage bins or soda ash silos should wear a properly roped safety belt to facilitate rescue in case of shifts or slides. They also should maintain continuous communication with someone stationed outside the storage facility.
Soda ash is non-explosive, non-flammable, and is not regulated for shipping by the U.S. Department of Transportation due to its non-hazardous status. Complete health and safety information is contained in our Soda Ash Safety Data Sheets (SDS).

Note: All statements, information, and data given herein are believed to be accurate and reliable but are presented without guaranty, warranty, or responsibility of any kind, express or implied. Statements or suggestions concerning possible use of our products are made without representation or warranty that any such use is free of patent infringement and are not recommendations to infringe on any patent. The user should not assume that all safety measures are indicated or that other measures may not be required.
STORAGE & HANDLING
Soda Ash Shelf Life
When it is stored in a moisture-free area, soda ash has an indefinite shelf life. If soda ash is stored in an environment with high humidity, or is allowed to get wet, it will react with moisture and can become chunky.
For additional information on safety and handling, please refer to our Soda Ash Safety Data Sheets(SDS).

Other Important Conveyance Information
When discharging soda ash from a hopper car, it’s a good idea to provide canvas sleeve adapters between the car’s discharge gates and the hopper under the track. This will help provide a constant feed into the hopper and make for a cleaner discharging process.
Selecting the correct conveyance method is critical to proper soda ash handling. For example, when designing a system for unloading bulk soda ash from bottom-dump hopper cars, it’s important to first determine whether or not the soda ash must be protected during conveyance.
Ciner soda ash is granular, free-flowing, and relatively dustless. If it is carried by conveyor systems that abrade the product, its granular nature may be altered. This could result in adverse product performance in certain applications and create dust problems during handling and storage.

Ciner Resources LP: Too Good To Be True? - Ciner Resources LP (NYSE:CINR) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Ciner Resources LP: Too Good To Be True?Mar.18.16 | About: Ciner Resources (CINR) Henry Elrod Long-term horizon, growth at reasonable price, value, contrarianSummaryLooking for high yield and apparent safety? Look here.Looking for stability? Look here.Looking for growth and capital gains? Not here.
Ciner Resources, MLP (CINR) is a limited partnership that owns a 51% stake in a trona mine in Wyoming. Trona is the raw material that is processed into soda ash. CINR, recently reported on by Double Dividend, is one of five US companies that mine trona. CINR appears to have about 20% of the US market, and roughly 4% to 5% of the world market for soda ash (market data based on Mineral Commodity Summaries produced by the US Geological Survey. CINR data are from the 10-K, available on the CINR web site, and from Morningstar, accessed through a proprietary Internet database.) Thanks to Double Dividend for their very detailed report pointing to this high-yield opportunity. This report will address some of the issues raised by Double Dividend and the responses to their report.
Organization/ownership structure.
The capital structure of a limited partnership is different from, but analogous to a corporate structure. Partnership profits are taxed at the partner level (reported to the partners along with other various deductions that pass-through to the partners, on forms K-1) so the LP entity does not pay or provide for income taxes. Ciner Resources LP, the operating company under discussion, has two classes of limited partnership interest units, common and subordinated, which participate equally in per unit distributions after the floor distribution amount of $.50 per unit is reached. Thus far in the life of the LP, the $.50 floor has been equaled or exceeded every quarter, and the two classes have received equal distributions. The so-called common LP units, which have voting rights, are owned approximately 25% by the public. The remainder of the common units and all of the subordinated units (which do not vote), and the general partner 2% interest are all owned by various entities owned or controlled by Turgay Ciner, a Turkish national. Ciner Resources LP holds a 51% interest in Ciner Wyoming LLC, which leases the Ciner mining rights in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. In effect the public limited partner owners (common unit holders) own what can be thought of as tantamount to a 6½% working interest in the Ciner Sweetwater, Wyoming (aka the Green River Basin) leases: The LP owns 51% of the mining rights, after the general partner's 2% interest. Thus the common units own ½ of 98% of 51% of the mining rights, and the public own ¼ of the common units. (¼ x ½ x .98 x .51 = .062475).
Risks.
ANSAC (American Natural Soda Ash Corporation), one of largest Ciner's competitors is also their largest customer, accounting for over 53% of their soda ash sales. ANSAC is a cooperative operated for the benefit of three of the five major US soda ash producers, including CINR, which controls CINR's international sales outside of Canada and the European Union. This arrangement could be construed as potentially violating various domestic and international anti-trust statutes, presenting, at the least, a significant litigation risk.
The trona deposits in Wyoming represent over 90% of the world's supply of trona. The trona mines in Wyoming are leased from the US government and others, on long-term leases requiring royalty payments as product is mined. Royalty payments are made to the US Bureau of Land Management, the State of Wyoming, and Rock Springs Royalty Company, a local royalty owner. Leases with Rock Springs Royalty do not expire on their face. Leases with the BLM generally have 10 year terms, with current leases expiring at various times from 2017 through 2025. CINR has preferential renewal rights with BLM. There is no contractual right to renew the State of Wyoming leases. All the leases began in the 1960s and have been renewed numerous times. CINR estimates their leases cover proven reserves that, at current production levels, would supply trona for 67 years.
The mining method used by CINR is underground pillar and room mining. They use large machines to extract the raw trona from strips or veins a few hundred feet underground. When it is brought to the surface it processed in the refinery. In a nutshell, the process of refining involves crushing the trona ore and dissolving it in water at about 150° Fahrenheit. The water is then filtered and evaporated, leaving the soda ash (or the slurry can be centrifuged to separate the precipitate soda ash (calcium carbonate and other alkali products)) residue, which is then loaded on rail cars for shipment to customers. Other mining methods and other refining methods may appear, which could put CINR at a competitive disadvantage.
CINR operates from a single mining and refining facility, presenting a geographic concentration of risk related to potential natural disasters such as earthquake, flood, and man-made disasters such as fire and explosion, and so on. Additionally, CINR sells a single product, subjecting investors to substantial exposure to obsolescence or technological change that could reduce the utility of the product.
Advantages.
According to Isonex, chemical engineering consultants, the cost to build a new soda ash refinery could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Thus there is a steep bar to entry into the business, limiting the growth in number of competitors.
CINR produces natural soda ash by processing trona. Their processes are simple and do not appear to release significant environmentally hazardous materials. Their costs give CINR a competitive advantage of producers of synthetic soda ash. Synthetic soda ash is produced by chemical processes from limestone and salt, but the process is significantly more expensive than processing soda ash from natural trona, and it results in the production of some environmental wastes. CINR management estimates their trona refining process costs 40% to 60% less per ton than the cost to produce a ton of synthetic soda ash.
Growth potential.
Although Ciner Resources LP is new, the underlying assets in the hands of the previous owners have produced trona, and refined and sold soda ash for over 50 years. For the last three years, CINR's shares of the US and world markets for refined soda ash have remained steady at 19.5% and 4.3%, respectively. Over the 13 years ending in 2013, world soda ash sales grew at a steady average rate of 3.3%. The average price per long ton gradually increased about 6% per annum over the last 15 years, but in the most recent three, that price inflation rate appears to have slowed to about 3%. Management believes that by reprocessing reclaimed briny waste water from the refining process (deca rehydration) they can reduce waste material and marginally increase production. CINR appears to be able to sell all they can make and refine, and opportunities for significant expansion of production appear limited. Given these factors, annual sales can be expected to approach $660 million by 2020.
Profitability.
Income statements for the last six years (through 2015, and including income statements from the predecessor entity) show the company averaged a 7.7% return on sales, improving to 10.1% average return on sales for the last two years. Given the forecast growth in world soda ash production and CINR's market share, CINR sales for 2015 can be estimated at about $660 million and with indicated distributable net income in the range of $50 and $65 million per year during the five years including 2020. At similar levels of income, CINR throws off about $100 million cash from operating activities, and free cash flow (operating cash less capital expenditures) available for financing activities such as debt reduction and distributions to unit holders, of about $75 million per year. Given the number of common and subordinated units issued and outstanding, and the units held by the general partner, free cash of about $45 million per year is required to maintain the distribution payments at the current levels of about $2.20 per unit, so the distribution at the $2.20 level seems safe.
Conclusions.
Is CINR too good to be true? Perhaps. Ciner Resources LP (NYSE:CINR) represents a minority interest in a major player in the capital intensive extractive mining and refining alkali industry, providing basic materials to manufacturers and other users of soda ash. Risks analogous to real estate investments in single tenant buildings arise from the single product, single location nature of the business, from the small number of competitors, and the significance of ANSAC as a dominant customer. The general economic risks from investing subject to basic commodity price fluctuations and world economic activity levels also are significant, but understandable. Operations are profitable, and the current distribution level appears safe for the long-term holder. Growth prospects are limited, as are opportunities for significant change in profitability levels, so the shares are not expected to appreciate significantly in the next five or so years. With current prices placing the yield in the range of 9% to 10%, the shares are recommended for income seekers. Again, thanks to Double Dividend for finding and pointing the Seeking Alpha investment community toward CINR.

Share Story5:09PM ET 2/16/2017 Business WireATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
    
      Ciner Resources LP (NYSE: CINR) today reported its financial and 
      operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 
      2016.
    

Fourth Quarter and Year Ended 2016 Financial Highlights:


        Net sales of $123.1 million decreased 2.6% over the prior-year fourth 
        quarter; year-to-date net sales of $475.2 million decreased 2.3% over 
        the prior year.
      

        Net income of $20.4 million decreased 27.9% over the prior-year fourth 
        quarter; year-to-date net income of $86.3 million decreased 18.7% over 
        the prior year.
      

        Adjusted EBITDA of $28.6 million decreased 20.3% over the prior-year 
        fourth quarter; year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA of $116.5 million 
        decreased 13.0% over the prior year.
      

        Earnings per unit was $0.49 in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 29.0% 
        over the prior-year fourth quarter; year-to-date earnings per unit of 
        $2.08 decreased 19.4% over the prior-year.
      

        Quarterly distribution declared per unit of $0.5670, increased 1.7% 
        over the prior-year fourth quarter;
      

        Net cash provided by operating activities of $24.3 million decreased 
        48.5% over prior-year fourth quarter; year-to-date net cash provided 
        by operating activities of $128.3 million decreased by 14.6% over the 
        prior-year.
      

        Distributable cash flow of $10.9 million decreased 34.7% over the 
        prior-year fourth quarter; year-to-date distributable cash flow of 
        $49.8 million decreased 10.6% over the prior-year. The distribution 
        coverage ratio was 0.96 and 1.10 for the fourth quarter and year ended 
        2016; and 1.50 and 1.27 for the fourth quarter and year ended 2015.
      

      Kirk Milling, CEO, commented "Despite challenges we encountered in the 
      fourth quarter and earlier in the year, our results were in line with 
      our 2016 outlook. The capital investments we have been making enabled us 
      to increase our sales volume 3% for the year helping to offset the 
      impact from lower global soda ash prices. Fourth quarter results were 
      adversely impacted by a number of unique operational issues that drove 
      production levels well below our expectations. Extreme weather 
      conditions led to lower on-stream time for our production units and we 
      lost a significant amount of ore production for a 10-day period due to 
      temporary operational modifications we were required to make by MSHA."
    

      "Looking into 2017, we've made good strides to lower our cost of goods 
      sold and improve the efficiency and productivity of our Green River 
      operations. Both of those should more than offset the headwinds we will 
      experience from lower net prices in North and South America. We also 
      have encouraging signs of market strength in Asia and anticipate higher 
      prices at least through the first half of the year."
    

2017 Outlook:


        We expect our soda ash total volume sold to increase 1% to 3%.
      

        We expect international prices to be flat to up 3%.
      

        We expect domestic pricing to be flat to down 3%.
      

        Maintenance of business capital expenditures are planned to be in the 
        range of $12 to $15 million.
      

        Expansion capital expenditures are planned to be in the range of $23 
        to $28 million.

Net sales. Net sales decreased by 2.6% to $123.1 million for the 
      three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to $126.4 million for the 
      three months ended December 31, 2015. The change in net sales was driven 
      by a decrease in total average sales price of 2.4%.
    

Cost of products sold. Cost of products sold, including 
      depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, increased by 5.5% to 
      $96.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 from $91.7 
      million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. The change in cost 
      of products sold was due primarily to an increase in freight costs 
      related to higher international (non-ANSAC) sales volumes, and an 
      increase in materials costs related to a disproportionately higher deca 
      rehydration ("DECA") use during the fourth quarter 2016 compared to the 
      fourth quarter 2015.

Net sales. Net sales decreased by 2.3% to $475.2 million for the 
      year ended December 31, 2016 from $486.4 million for the year ended 
      December 31, 2015. The change in net sales was driven by a decrease in 
      total average sales price of 5.2%, partly offset by an increase in soda 
      ash volumes sold of 3.0%.
    

Cost of products sold. Cost of products sold, including 
      depreciation and amortization expense, increased by 1.6% to $361.7 
      million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $356.1 million for the 
      year ended December 31, 2015. The change in cost of products sold was 
      due to a 3.0% increase in soda ash volumes sold, as well as an increase 
      in materials costs related to an increase in the DECA harvesting costs 
      during 2016 compared to 2015, and increased royalty fees from higher 
      royalty rates.

FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY


      As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of 
      $19.7 million and $20.4 million, respectively. In addition, we have $102 
      million of remaining capacity under our revolving credit facilities. As 
      of December 31, 2016, our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios, as 
      calculated in Ciner Wyoming Credit Facility, were 1.0 and 1.1, 
      respectively.
    

CASH FLOWS AND QUARTERLY CASH DISTRIBUTION


Cash Flows


      Cash provided by operating activities was $128.3 million during the year 
      ended December 31, 2016 compared to $150.2 million of cash generated 
      during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in cash provided 
      by operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease of $19.9 
      million in net income during 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of a 
      decrease in average sales price and higher operating expenses.
    

      Cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 
      2016 were partially offset by cash used in investing activities due to 
      capital expenditures of $25.3 million and cash used in financing 
      activities during the year of $103.7 million. The majority of the cash 
      used in financing activities during 2016 was due to distributions paid 
      of $91.7 million and net repayments on revolving credit facility of 
      $12.0 million.
    

Quarterly Distribution


      On January 12, 2017, the Partnership declared its fourth quarter 2016 
      quarterly distribution of $0.5670 per unit. This represents an increase 
      of 1.7% over the distribution declared for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
      The quarterly cash distribution was paid on February 13, 2017 to 
      unitholders of record on January 31, 2017.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted 
      accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). We also present the 
      non-GAAP financial measures of:
    

        Adjusted EBITDA;
      

        Distributable cash flow; and
      

        Distribution coverage ratio.
      

      We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest 
      expense, income tax, depreciation, depletion and amortization and 
      certain other expenses that are non-cash charges or that we consider not 
      to be indicative of ongoing operations. Distributable cash flow is 
      defined as Adjusted EBITDA less net cash paid for interest, maintenance 
      capital expenditures and income taxes, each as attributable to Ciner 
      Resources LP. Distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in 
      working capital balances. We define distribution coverage ratio as the 
      ratio of distributable cash flow as of the end of the period to cash 
      distributions payable with respect to such period.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio 
      are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and 
      external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as 
      industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to 
      assess:
    

        our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded 
        partnerships in our industry, without regard to historical cost basis 
        or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods;
      

        the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make 
        distributions to our unitholders;
      

        our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; 
        and
      

        the viability of capital expenditure projects and the returns on 
        investment of various investment opportunities.
      

      We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash 
      flow and distribution coverage ratio provide useful information to 
      investors in assessing our financial condition and results of 
      operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted 
      EBITDA and distributable cash flow are net income and net cash provided 
      by operating activities. Our non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted 
      EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio should 
      not be considered as alternatives to GAAP net income, operating income, 
      net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of 
      financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. 
      Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations 
      as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all items that 
      affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. 
      Investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow 
      and distribution coverage ratio in isolation or as a substitute for 
      analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA, 
      distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio may be defined 
      differently by other companies, including those in our industry, our 
      definition of Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution 
      coverage ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of 
      other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.
    

      The table below presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial 
      measures of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the GAAP 
      financial measures of net income and net cash provided by operating 
      activities:

(1) The Partnership may fund expansion-related capital 
            expenditures with borrowings under existing credit facilities such 
            that expansion-related capital expenditures will have no impact on 
            cash on hand or the calculation of cash available for 
            distribution. In certain instances, the timing of the 
            Partnership's borrowings and/or its cash management practices will 
            result in a mismatch between the period of the borrowing and the 
            period of the capital expenditure. In those instances, the 
            Partnership adjusts designated reserves (as provided in the 
            partnership agreement) to take account of the timing difference. 
            Accordingly, expansion-related capital expenditures have been 
            excluded from the presentation of cash available for distribution.

Style Scores:



A Value | A Growth | B Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
