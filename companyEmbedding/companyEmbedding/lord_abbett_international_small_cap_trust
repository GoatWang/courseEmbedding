Bankruptcy
                      

IRAs and qualified plans have somewhat different rules regarding bankruptcy and creditor protection.
                      


 If an investor faces insolvency, he or she can look to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) for guidance on retirement assets that are shielded from federal bankruptcy. Effective for bankruptcies filed on or after 10/17/2005, all retirement accounts are protected in the event of individual bankruptcy, whether or not the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is applicable. This protection is also extended to IRAs. It is intended to shield retirement assets from creditors and prevents a participant's bankruptcy from causing the investor to lose assets that have been set aside for retirement.

Beneficiary
                      

Spouse? Non-spouse? Non-person? All can be named as IRA beneficiaries, but tax treatment can be very different.
                      


Naming a beneficiary using a beneficiary form provided by or accepted by the IRA custodian is very important. Why? What's written on the beneficiary designation form, not contained within the investor's will, determines who inherits the IRA. In other words, IRAs do not pass through probate.

                      Estate Tax
                      
                    
Like all assets, IRAs must be considered as part of the estate plan. But to whom the account is left can make a significant difference.
                      


Estate planning is critical to preserving wealth for future generations. The estate tax or "death tax" is a federal and or state tax placed on a decedent's asset transfer. A gross estate includes the value of all property in which the decedent had an interest at the time of death, including employer-sponsored retirement plans and IRAs. Whether an estate will be subject to estate taxes depends on the year of death, the gross estate's value, the amount of debt, the expense of settling the estate, and any available deductions.

IRA versus Qualified Plan Beneficiary Rules
                      

Are there different rules when it comes to naming an IRA beneficiary versus a qualified plan beneficiary?
                      


By law, qualified plans, such as a 401(k)s, require the participant's spouse to be the designated 100% beneficiary. In order for a married 401(k) plan participant to name any other person as beneficiary, the spouse must waive his or her rights as beneficiary in writing, and most plans require that any spousal waiver be witnessed by a notary public. In addition, a new beneficiary must be named.

Naming a Trust
                      

Why would an IRA account owner want to name a trust or non-person as a beneficiary?
                      


One type of frequently used trust is called a "see-through" trust. It creates a mechanism for the deceased to control account withdrawals, post-death. In addition, a see-through trust allows the underlying beneficiary to "stretch" distributions over their life expectancy. Prior to naming a trust as a beneficiary, an investor needs to be aware of the complex rules that govern trust beneficiaries.

Small-Cap World Tour: The REIT Time for Spain? « The Investment Conversation Blog 





























































































Small-Cap World Tour: The REIT Time for Spain?June 26, 2015 9:55 AMBy Harold E. Sharon
336 Views

With quantitative easing driving recovery in Europe, some Spanish real estate investment opportunities feature the potential for attractive yields and capital appreciation.











(Third of a three-part series.)


























After investing aggressively in German real estate companies, Lord Abbett’s international small cap equity team has found similar opportunities in Spain, one of the cheaper rental markets for commercial space in Europe.

















With Spain’s economy expected to grow 2.8% this year, according to the Bank of Spain, and global private equity firms picking up heavily discounted properties already, some real estate investment trusts are yielding nearly 5%.  
We think we’ve seen a bottoming in the marketplace, and opportunities for experienced local players to acquire (and upgrade) assets, particularly defaulted ones held by the financial sector, as well as “Sareb,” the government’s “bad bank” for real estate.
Mentions of “bad banks” may remind some readers of the U.S. savings & loan (S&L) crisis of the 1980s. Back then, Congress set up the Resolution Trust Corp. to liquidate assets, primarily real estate-related assets such as mortgage loans, which had been assets of S&Ls declared insolvent. In November 2012, Spain set up Sareb, a management company where troubled banks could transfer distressed real estate assets to facilitate an orderly divestment of such properties.
Sareb received almost 200,000 assets, which were valued at 50.781 billion euros in two phases. The main tranche (36.567 billion euros) was contributed by four nationalized banks. The second transfer (14.086 billion euros) was contributed by four banks that received State funding. Out of all of the assets, 80% are loans and 20% are properties.1
While new construction dried up, many of those Sareb properties lay vacant for five to seven years. As a result, prime center-city properties lost substantial value. Suburban properties did even worse. 
“Madrid and Barcelona are where the recovery is happening fastest,” says Lord Abbett Portfolio Manager Edward Allinson. “So the challenge for REITs is to increase occupancy rates and rental rates, then reposition and renovate properties.”
In Italy, the team took a substantial position in an asset manager that appeared well positioned to capitalize on savers’ long-simmering frustration with paltry government bond yields and greater willingness to invest in alternatives such as equities. After all, Italy, like most major equity markets worldwide, sports current dividend yields in excess of their 10-year government bond yields. As a result, the company has attracted a huge amount of capital in the last several months, which in turn has driven up its stock price.
Will quantitative easing be enough to revive Europe’s economy? Log your opinion here. And be sure to visit the other stops on our small-cap world tour, India and Japan.

Risks to consider: The value of investments in equity securities will fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and to changes in the prospects of particular companies and/or sectors in the economy. Investments in small and mid-cap companies involve greater risks not associated with investing in more established companies, such as business risk, significant stock price fluctuations, and illiquidity. Investing in international securities generally poses greater risk than investing in domestic securities, including greater price fluctuations and higher transaction costs. Special risks are inherent to international investing, including those related to currency fluctuations and foreign, political, and economic events. With respect to certain foreign countries, there is a possibility of nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition of withholding or other taxes, and political or social instability that could affect investments in those countries. The securities markets of emerging countries tend to be less liquid, especially subject to greater price volatility, tend to have smaller capitalization companies, less government regulation, and may not be subject to as extensive and frequent accounting, financial, and other reporting requirements as securities issued in more developed countries. Further, investing in the securities of issuers located in certain emerging countries may present a greater risk of loss resulting from problems in security registration and custody or substantial economic or political disruptions. No investing strategy can overcome all market volatility or guarantee future results.

When appreciated company stock is a portion of a retirement plan distribution, recipients may benefit by transferring the shares to a brokerage account while rolling the non-stock assets to an IRA. A special provision known as net unrealized appreciation (NUA) allows a plan participant to potentially take advantage of lower tax rates.
The NUA tax break on lump-sum distributions from a qualified plan allows participants to trade ordinary federal income tax rates1 (39.6% top marginal bracket in 2016) for long-term capital gains treatment (maximum of 20%). To take advantage, a participant would transfer his/her company stock to a brokerage account (non-IRA) paying ordinary income tax on the amount the stock cost (basis) only. Subsequently, when sold, the stock would be subject to long-term capital gains rates, currently 15% or 20% depending on income. Long-term capital gains treatment applies even if the stock is sold prior to being held for one year.
To be eligible to receive NUA tax-treatment, a number of specific rules need to be followed including:

Distribution must qualify as a “lump-sum.”
Distribution must be due to certain events including: 59½ (if plan permits), separation from service, retirement.


Assuming you NUA-qualify, you will not pay current income tax on the stock appreciation. Instead, in the year of distribution you would be subject to income tax on the basis only. However, depending on age and when separation occurs, there may be a 10% penalty in addition to paying ordinary income tax on the amount of basis placed in the brokerage. As shares are sold, only capital gains2 taxes apply to the shares sold, so the individual would then pay tax on the appreciation of the shares above the cost basis at a long-term, capital gains2 rate based on the initial transfer. It does not matter how long the shares were owned during plan participation.
Please consult an IRA specialist at 888-522-2388 for additional information.

1 Income taxes can be postponed until a later date; examples include IRAs and 401(k) plan earnings.
2 An increase in the value of a capital asset, such as a mutual fund or a common stock. If the asset is sold, the gain is a realized capital gain, which may be either short term (one year or less) or long term (more than one year).







There may be fees, expenses, taxes, and penalties associated with early IRA withdrawals.
Lord Abbett will waive (or otherwise pay) the yearly $10.00 custodial fee that would be charged each year on an ongoing basis to every new IRA account and, therefore, will not assess a custodial account fee in 2016 or any year afterward. Fund level fees and expenses are still applicable. Please see the current prospectus.
