History[edit]
Varian was founded in 1948 as Varian Associates by Russell H. Varian, Sigurd F. Varian, William Webster Hansen, and Edward Ginzton to sell the Klystron, the first tube which could generate electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies, and other electromagnetic equipment.
By 1999, Varian Associates had branched into semiconductor, vacuum tube, and medical device fields. On April 2, 1999 these divisions split to become Varian Semiconductor, Varian, Inc. and Varian Medical Systems.
Acquired companies[edit]
Varian Medical Systems has acquired other companies including Pan-Pacific Enterprises,[4] ACCEL Instruments,[5] Bio-Imaging Research, Inc.[6] Sigma Micro Informatique Conseil,[7] Argus Software,[8] Velocity Medical Solutions.[9] and MeVis Medical Solutions AG [10]
Products[edit]
X-ray[edit]
The EDGE™ Radiosurgery Suite was launched in 2012. It is described as "a fully integrated, dedicated system for performing advanced radiosurgery using new real-time tumor tracking technology and motion management capabilities." [11] The first cancer centers to use the new system were the Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon, Portugal and Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan.[12]
Proton Therapy[edit]
Varian manufactures the ProBeam Proton Therapy System currently running at RPTC Rinecker Proton Therapy Center in Munich, Germany and Scripps proton-therapy in San Diego, California. These are an all pencil-beam scanning proton therapy system utilizing IMPT video which was developed with PSI of Switzerland. Varian also develops medical software and radiology information system for proton treatment-planning system.
Locations[edit]




Varian headquarters in Palo Alto


Varian corporate headquarters is in Palo Alto, California. Varian has facilities in California, Maryland, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Brazil, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Australia and Algeria.
Corporate affairs[edit]
In September 2012, Dow Wilson replaced Timothy Guertin as President and CEO. Guertin had been the CEO since 2006 when he replaced Richard M. Levy, who had been with Varian for 37 years and still serves as chairman of the board of directors. Wilson is a graduate of Brigham Young University, and holds an MBA from the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.
Varian operates a corporate philanthropy and charitable giving organization through the Varian Medical Systems Foundation. It operates within the Community Foundation of Silicon Valley (CFSV).
Litigation[edit]
Free speech[edit]
In 1999 Varian Medical Systems, Inc. sued a former employee for defamation in Varian v. Delfino. The terminated employee Dr. Michelangelo Delfino posted numerous messages criticizing the company on the Internet. The case finally settled on undisclosed terms. The lawsuit itself was controversial, heavily publicized, and led to a landmark ruling about California's anti-SLAPP statute. Some market-based workers rights activists uphold Delfino as an example because he mortgaged his house to pay his legal bills related to the lawsuit with Varian.[13]
University of Pittsburgh[edit]
On April 25, 2012 a US federal judge in Pittsburgh awarded attorney fees, costs, and doubled damages totaling $73.6 million to the University of Pittsburgh after the university won a suit on medical patent infringement grounds against Varian.[14]

History[edit]
Varian was founded in 1948 as Varian Associates by Russell H. Varian, Sigurd F. Varian, William Webster Hansen, and Edward Ginzton to sell the Klystron, the first tube which could generate electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies, and other electromagnetic equipment.
By 1999, Varian Associates had branched into semiconductor, vacuum tube, and medical device fields. On April 2, 1999 these divisions split to become Varian Semiconductor, Varian, Inc. and Varian Medical Systems.
Acquired companies[edit]
Varian Medical Systems has acquired other companies including Pan-Pacific Enterprises,[4] ACCEL Instruments,[5] Bio-Imaging Research, Inc.[6] Sigma Micro Informatique Conseil,[7] Argus Software,[8] Velocity Medical Solutions.[9] and MeVis Medical Solutions AG [10]
Products[edit]
X-ray[edit]
The EDGE™ Radiosurgery Suite was launched in 2012. It is described as "a fully integrated, dedicated system for performing advanced radiosurgery using new real-time tumor tracking technology and motion management capabilities." [11] The first cancer centers to use the new system were the Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon, Portugal and Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan.[12]
Proton Therapy[edit]
Varian manufactures the ProBeam Proton Therapy System currently running at RPTC Rinecker Proton Therapy Center in Munich, Germany and Scripps proton-therapy in San Diego, California. These are an all pencil-beam scanning proton therapy system utilizing IMPT video which was developed with PSI of Switzerland. Varian also develops medical software and radiology information system for proton treatment-planning system.
Locations[edit]




Varian headquarters in Palo Alto


Varian corporate headquarters is in Palo Alto, California. Varian has facilities in California, Maryland, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Brazil, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Australia and Algeria.
Corporate affairs[edit]
In September 2012, Dow Wilson replaced Timothy Guertin as President and CEO. Guertin had been the CEO since 2006 when he replaced Richard M. Levy, who had been with Varian for 37 years and still serves as chairman of the board of directors. Wilson is a graduate of Brigham Young University, and holds an MBA from the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.
Varian operates a corporate philanthropy and charitable giving organization through the Varian Medical Systems Foundation. It operates within the Community Foundation of Silicon Valley (CFSV).
Litigation[edit]
Free speech[edit]
In 1999 Varian Medical Systems, Inc. sued a former employee for defamation in Varian v. Delfino. The terminated employee Dr. Michelangelo Delfino posted numerous messages criticizing the company on the Internet. The case finally settled on undisclosed terms. The lawsuit itself was controversial, heavily publicized, and led to a landmark ruling about California's anti-SLAPP statute. Some market-based workers rights activists uphold Delfino as an example because he mortgaged his house to pay his legal bills related to the lawsuit with Varian.[13]
University of Pittsburgh[edit]
On April 25, 2012 a US federal judge in Pittsburgh awarded attorney fees, costs, and doubled damages totaling $73.6 million to the University of Pittsburgh after the university won a suit on medical patent infringement grounds against Varian.[14]

History[edit]
Varian was founded in 1948 as Varian Associates by Russell H. Varian, Sigurd F. Varian, William Webster Hansen, and Edward Ginzton to sell the Klystron, the first tube which could generate electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies, and other electromagnetic equipment.
By 1999, Varian Associates had branched into semiconductor, vacuum tube, and medical device fields. On April 2, 1999 these divisions split to become Varian Semiconductor, Varian, Inc. and Varian Medical Systems.
Acquired companies[edit]
Varian Medical Systems has acquired other companies including Pan-Pacific Enterprises,[4] ACCEL Instruments,[5] Bio-Imaging Research, Inc.[6] Sigma Micro Informatique Conseil,[7] Argus Software,[8] Velocity Medical Solutions.[9] and MeVis Medical Solutions AG [10]
Products[edit]
X-ray[edit]
The EDGE™ Radiosurgery Suite was launched in 2012. It is described as "a fully integrated, dedicated system for performing advanced radiosurgery using new real-time tumor tracking technology and motion management capabilities." [11] The first cancer centers to use the new system were the Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon, Portugal and Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan.[12]
Proton Therapy[edit]
Varian manufactures the ProBeam Proton Therapy System currently running at RPTC Rinecker Proton Therapy Center in Munich, Germany and Scripps proton-therapy in San Diego, California. These are an all pencil-beam scanning proton therapy system utilizing IMPT video which was developed with PSI of Switzerland. Varian also develops medical software and radiology information system for proton treatment-planning system.
Locations[edit]




Varian headquarters in Palo Alto


Varian corporate headquarters is in Palo Alto, California. Varian has facilities in California, Maryland, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Brazil, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Australia and Algeria.
Corporate affairs[edit]
In September 2012, Dow Wilson replaced Timothy Guertin as President and CEO. Guertin had been the CEO since 2006 when he replaced Richard M. Levy, who had been with Varian for 37 years and still serves as chairman of the board of directors. Wilson is a graduate of Brigham Young University, and holds an MBA from the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.
Varian operates a corporate philanthropy and charitable giving organization through the Varian Medical Systems Foundation. It operates within the Community Foundation of Silicon Valley (CFSV).
Litigation[edit]
Free speech[edit]
In 1999 Varian Medical Systems, Inc. sued a former employee for defamation in Varian v. Delfino. The terminated employee Dr. Michelangelo Delfino posted numerous messages criticizing the company on the Internet. The case finally settled on undisclosed terms. The lawsuit itself was controversial, heavily publicized, and led to a landmark ruling about California's anti-SLAPP statute. Some market-based workers rights activists uphold Delfino as an example because he mortgaged his house to pay his legal bills related to the lawsuit with Varian.[13]
University of Pittsburgh[edit]
On April 25, 2012 a US federal judge in Pittsburgh awarded attorney fees, costs, and doubled damages totaling $73.6 million to the University of Pittsburgh after the university won a suit on medical patent infringement grounds against Varian.[14]

Levy, who had been with Varian for 37 years and still serves as chairman of the board of directors. Wilson is a graduate of Brigham Young University, and holds an MBA from the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.

Litigation[edit]
Free speech[edit]
In 1999 Varian Medical Systems, Inc. sued a former employee for defamation in Varian v. Delfino. The terminated employee Dr. Michelangelo Delfino posted numerous messages criticizing the company on the Internet. The case finally settled on undisclosed terms. The lawsuit itself was controversial, heavily publicized, and led to a landmark ruling about California's anti-SLAPP statute. Some market-based workers rights activists uphold Delfino as an example because he mortgaged his house to pay his legal bills related to the lawsuit with Varian.[13]
University of Pittsburgh[edit]
On April 25, 2012 a US federal judge in Pittsburgh awarded attorney fees, costs, and doubled damages totaling $73.6 million to the University of Pittsburgh after the university won a suit on medical patent infringement grounds against Varian.[14]
