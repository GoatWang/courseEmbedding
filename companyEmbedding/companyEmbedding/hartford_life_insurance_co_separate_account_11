	Great rates and rewards on car insurance from The Hartford.
Switch your car insurance to the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford1 and save. Enjoy great rates that recognize your experience and the extra benefits you deserve as an AARP member. You may even be eligible for additional savings. To learn more about the added automobile insurance savings and benefits for which you are eligible, get a quote. It’s easy!
 

Lifetime Renewability
Once you have an auto insurance policy with The Hartford, your coverage will be renewed for as long as you’re able to drive. Just meet a few simple requirements such as maintaining a valid driver's license and paying your premiums.†
 



12-Month Rate Protection
You can relax knowing your low auto insurance premium is locked-in for a full year. This sets us apart from other insurers who may change rates every six months or even sooner.
 

RecoverCare – Assistance After an Accident
The Hartford is here for you if you're injured in an automobile accident. This coverage provides reimbursement for essential home services you cannot perform yourself, such as house cleaning, lawn maintenance, and even dog walking. This coverage applies when injuries are not already covered by Medicare or health insurance.§
 

New Car Replacement Coverage
If you total your new car within the first 15 months or 15,000 miles after you buy it (whichever comes first), we’ll pay to replace it with a new vehicle of the same make, model and equipment – with no deduction for depreciation.§§
 

Lifetime Car Repair Assurance
Use one of the 1,600+ authorized repair shops in our approved network, and we’ll stand behind the workmanship of covered repairs for as long as you own or lease your vehicle. With this great coverage, you won’t have to go through the hassle of finding a trusted repair service after an accident.
 

24/7 Claims Hotline
Accidents can happen any time of day or night and you deserve an automobile insurance company that can respond immediately no matter what time you call. You can reach our claims reporting service 24/7, and we’ll walk you through the car insurance claims process. Our 6-Point Claim Commitment is your assurance of getting prompt, caring service from the start of your claim to the end.
 

Enjoy even more car insurance protection.


ADVANTAGE PLUS Program‡
In addition to the features and benefits mentioned above, the Advantage PLUS package includes:
 

First Accident Forgiveness 
Everyone makes mistakes once in a while. Once you qualify, if you’re involved in an accident, that first accident will be forgiven and your premium won’t increase as a result. To qualify, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for five consecutive years.
 

Disappearing Deductible
We believe in rewarding great drivers. With our disappearing deductible, your collision deductible on your car insurance policy will go down each year – all the way to $0 – as long as you maintain a clean driving record.‡
 

One Deductible
If you file a claim for a loss involving two of your vehicles that are covered by a car insurance policy with The Hartford, you'll pay only one deductible – whichever is higher – for the covered losses to the vehicles. This benefit also applies if your car and home are involved in the same covered loss and you carry homeowners insurance with The Hartford. You'll pay only the highest deductible.‡
 

Waiver of Deductible for a Not-At-Fault Accident
In most cases, if you are not at fault in an accident, The Hartford will waive your deductible.
 

$100 Deductible Reduction
Typically, even if you’re not at fault, you may have to pay out of pocket for repair costs that fall below the deductible amount of your car insurance policy. With The Hartford, you can have your car repaired at any shop you choose. However, when you elect to use a Hartford-authorized shop for vehicle repair, we’ll reduce your collision deductible by $100. Not available in all states.
 
 
† If you are age 50 or older, once you're insured through this Program for at least 60 days, you cannot be refused renewal as long as applicable premiums are paid when due. Also, you and other customary drivers of your vehicles must retain valid licenses, remain physically and mentally capable of operating an automobile, have no convictions for driving while intoxicated and must not have obtained your policy through material misrepresentation. Benefit currently not available in HI, MI, NH and NC.
 

§ Availability of RecoverCare benefit and benefit levels vary by state. The Hartford RecoverCare Advantage® is a registered mark of The Hartford.
 
§§ Limitations apply.
 
‡ Some benefits, including First Accident Forgiveness and the Disappearing Deductible, are only available with the Advantage Plus package. A policy without these benefits is also available. [Call for details.] To qualify for the Accident Forgiveness benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record (no accidents or violations) for five consecutive years. First Accident Forgiveness is not available to CA policyholders. To qualify for the Disappearing Collision Deductible benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for three consecutive years. NY drivers are not eligible for the complete disappearance of the deductible, although it will be reduced to a minimum of $100. The Advantage Plus package option, the Disappearing Deductible benefit and the Accident Forgiveness benefit are not available in all states.

	Tailor your car insurance at a rate you can afford.

With the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford, you don’t have to sacrifice to save. You can tailor your car insurance coverage to suit your needs at a rate you can afford.
 
A cracked windshield. A dented fender. Injuries that require medical care. Accidents can be costly. Feel confident behind the wheel knowing you have the car insurance coverage you need. Here’s how our coverages help protect you:
 

Collision Coverage
Helps pay for damage done to your car in the event of a collision – whether it’s with another vehicle or an object. For example, if you back into a tree and damage your car, this coverage could help pay the repair fees.
 
Learn About Collision
 

Non-Collision Damage
Also known as “comprehensive,” this car insurance coverage helps pay for “non-collision” damage to your car resulting from things like natural disasters, theft and vandalism. For example, if you park your car under a tree during a snowstorm and heavy snow takes down a branch and breaks your windshield, non-collision damage insurance could help pay the cost to repair the damage to your car.

 
Learn About Non-Collision
 


Car Insurance Medical Payments
Helps cover medical care, recovery, rehab, and remedial care for you and your family after an auto accident.

 
Learn About Medical Payments
 


Auto Policy Bodily Injury Liability
This coverage can protect you against financial loss and helps pay the legal costs in the event you cause an auto accident injuring another person. For example, if you accidentally run a red light, or spin out in the snow and end up injuring another person, this coverage could help cover the costs of those injuries.

 
Learn About Bodily Injury
 


Property Damage Liability
Pays for damage your vehicle causes to other people's property (e.g. fences, mailboxes, other vehicles). For example, if your car slides out in the rain and you take out a neighbor’s mailbox or damage their landscaping, this insurance could help pay for the damages.

 
Learn About Property Damage
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury
Pays bodily injury and death expenses for you and your passengers if you're hit by an uninsured or underinsured driver.

 
Learn About Uninsured Bodily Injury
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Property Damage
Helps pay for damage to your vehicle if your vehicle is struck by an uninsured driver, a hit-and-run driver, or an insured driver whose property damage liability limit is too low to cover the losses, this coverage helps pay for the damage.

 
Learn About Uninsured Property Damage
 


Personal Injury Protection a.k.a. “No-Fault Insurance”
Pays for losses tied only to injuries – regardless of who caused the accident. This can be especially helpful after an accident that involves multiple cars. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About No-Fault Insurance
 


Glass Coverage
Full glass coverage pays the amount of a covered glass loss with no deductible. For example, let’s say your car gets broken into overnight and a window is smashed. The estimate to repair it comes in at $600. If you have comprehensive automobile insurance but not auto glass coverage, you will have to pay your deductible before insurance begins to cover the cost to repair the windshield.
 
If you have full glass coverage, the expense of repairing the window is covered in full with no out-of-pocket costs to you. This coverage is optional on your auto insurance policy and can be purchased for an additional premium. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About Glass
 


Towing Coverage
This coverage helps pay towing and labor charges associated with getting your vehicle running again in the event of a break down. For example, if your car battery dies on the interstate, this coverage could help pay for the costs of having your vehicle jumped started.

 
Learn About Towing
 


Rental Car Expense
Transportation Expense coverage helps to pay for a rental car in the event of a covered comprehensive or collision loss. For example, you slide off a wet road crashing into a tree, this coverage could help pay for the charges to rent a replacement vehicle while yours is in the shop for repairs.

 
Learn About Rental Expense
 


Personal Umbrella Insurance
Umbrella coverage goes beyond accidents and damages and helps when a covered loss exceeds the liability coverage limits of your home or auto policies. For example, if you are sued and the legal costs exceed the limits of your primary coverage, umbrella coverage can help cover the excess costs.
 
Learn About Umbrella

THIS AGREEMENT, made and entered into this 16th day of December, 2002, by and   
among HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, a stock life insurance company organized 
under the laws of Connecticut (hereinafter the "COMPANY"), on its own behalf and
on behalf of each separate account of the Company set forth in SCHEDULE A       
hereto, as may be amended from time to time (each such account hereinafter      
referred to as a "SEPARATE ACCOUNT"), Legg Mason Value Trust, Inc.,             
(hereinafter, collectively, the "FUND"), and Legg Mason Wood Walker,            
Incorporated, a Maryland corporation (hereinafter the "UNDERWRITER").           

WITNESSETH: 

WHEREAS, beneficial interests in the Fund are divided into several series of    
shares, each representing the interest in a particular managed portfolio of     
securities and other assets (the "PORTFOLIOS"); and                             

WHEREAS, the Fund is registered as an open-end management investment company    
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (hereinafter the "1940     
ACT") and its shares are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(hereinafter the "1933 ACT"); and                                               

WHEREAS, the Company issues certain group variable annuity contracts and group  
funding agreements (the "CONTRACTS") in connection with retirement plans        
intended to meet the qualification requirements of Sections 401, 403(b) or 457  
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"); and              

WHEREAS, each Separate Account is a duly organized, validly existing segregated 
asset account, established by resolution of the Board of Directors of the       
Company under the insurance laws of the State of Connecticut to set aside and   
invest assets attributable to the Contracts; and                                

WHEREAS, Legg Mason Funds Management, Inc. (the "ADVISER") is the investment    
adviser of the Portfolios of the Fund and is duly registered as an investment   
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "ADVISERS    
ACT"), and any applicable state securities laws; and                            

WHEREAS, the Underwriter is the principal underwriter for the Fund and is       
registered as a broker-dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission       
(hereinafter the "SEC") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended

on behalf of each corresponding Separate Account set forth on such SCHEDULE A to
fund the Contracts and the Underwriter is authorized to sell such shares to unit
investment trusts such as the Separate Accounts at net asset value.             

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of their mutual promises, the Company, the Fund

ARTICLE I. Purchase and Redemption of Funds Shares.               

1.1  The Fund and the Underwriter agree to sell to the Company those shares of  
the Portfolios which the Company orders on behalf of any Separate Account,      
executing such orders on a daily basis at the net asset value next computed     
after receipt and acceptance by the Fund or its designee of such order. For     
purposes of this Section, the Company shall be the designee of the Fund for     
receipt of such orders from each Separate Account. Receipt by such designee     
shall constitute receipt by the Fund; provided that the Fund or the Underwriter 
receives notice of such order via the National Securities Clearing Corporation  
(the "NSCC") by 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the next following Business Day. The  
Fund will receive all orders to purchase Portfolio shares using the NSCC's      
Defined Contribution Clearance & Settlement ("DCC&S") platform. The Fund will   
also provide the Company with account positions and activity data using the     
NSCC's Networking platform. The Company shall pay for Portfolio shares by the   
scheduled close of federal funds transmissions on the same Business Day it      
places an order to purchase Portfolio shares in accordance with this section    
using the NSCC's Fund/SERV System. Payment shall be in federal funds transmitted
by wire from the Company's designated Settling Bank to the NSCC. "BUSINESS DAY" 
shall mean any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and 
on which the Fund calculates it net asset value pursuant to the rules of the    
SEC. "NETWORKING" shall mean the NSCC's product that allows Fund's and Companies
to exchange account level information electronically. "SETTLING BANK" shall mean
the entity appointed by the Fund to perform such settlement services on behalf  
of the Fund and agrees to abide by the NSCC's Rules and Procedures insofar as   
they relate to the same day funds settlement.                                   

If the Company is somehow prohibited form submitting purchase and settlement    
instructions to the Fund for Portfolio shares via the NSCC's DCC&S platform the 
following shall apply to this Section:                                          

The Fund and the Underwriter agree to sell the Company those shares of the      
Portfolios which the Company orders on behalf of any Separate Account, executing
such orders on a daily basis at the net asset value next computed after receipt 
and acceptance by the Fund or its designee of such order. For purposes of this  
Section, the Company shall be the designee of the Fund for the receipt of such  
orders from the Separate Account and receipt by such designee shall constitute  
receipt by the Fund; provided that the Fund or the Underwriter receives notice  
of such order by 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the next following Business Day. The 
Company shall pay for Portfolio shares by the scheduled close of federal funds  
transmissions on the same Business Day it places an order to purchase Portfolio 
shares in accordance with this section. Payment shall be in federal funds       
transmitted by wire to the Fund's designated custodian. "BUSINESS DAY" shall    
mean any day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on    
which the Fund calculated it net asset value pursuant to the rules of the SEC.  

1.2  The Fund and the Underwriter agree to make shares of the Portfolios        
available indefinitely for purchase at the applicable net asset value per share 
by the Company on Business Days; provided, however, that the Board of Trustees  
or Directors, as applicable, of the Fund (hereinafter the "TRUSTEES/DIRECTORS") 
may refuse to sell shares of any Portfolio to any person, or suspend or         
terminate the offering of shares of any Portfolio if such action is required by 
law or by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction or is, in the sole         
discretion of the Trustees/Directors, acting in good faith and in compliance    
with their fiduciary duties under federal and any applicable state laws,        
necessary in the best interests of the shareholders of any Portfolio.

1.3  The Fund and the Underwriter agree to redeem for cash, upon the Company's  
request, any full or fractional shares of the Fund held by the Company on behalf
of a Separate Account, executing such requests on a daily basis at the net asset
value next computed after receipt and acceptance by the Fund or its designee of 
the request for redemption. For purposes of this Section, the Company shall be  
the designee of the Fund for receipt of requests for redemption from each       
Separate Account and receipt by such designee shall constitute receipt by the   
Fund; provided the Fund or the Underwriter receives notice of such request for  
redemption via the NCSA by 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the next following Business
Day. The Fund will receive all orders to redeem Portfolio shares using the      
NSCC's DCC&S platform. The Fund will also provide the Company with account      
positions and activity data using the NSCC's Networking platform. Payment for

6.4.  Indemnification Procedure                                                 

(a)  Any person obligated to provide indemnification under this Article VI      
("INDEMNIFYING PARTY" for the purpose of this Section 6.4) shall not be liable  
under the indemnification provisions of this Article VI with respect to any     
claim made against a party entitled to indemnification under this Article VI    
("INDEMNIFIED PARTY" for the purpose of this Section 6.4) unless such           
Indemnified Party shall have notified the Indemnifying Party in writing within a
reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving           
information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such         
Indemnified Party (or after such party shall have received notice of such       
service on any designated agent), but failure to notify the Indemnifying Party  
of any such claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability   
which it may have to the Indemnified Party against whom such action is brought  
otherwise than on account of the indemnification provision of this Article VI.  
In case any such action is brought against the Indemnified Party, the           
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in the  
defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party also shall be entitled to assume the    
defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the party named in the action.    
After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the        
Indemnifying Party's election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified    
Party shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by the
Indemnified

Party, and the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to such party under this   
Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such party   
independently in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs
of investigation, unless:                                                       

       (i)  the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually
agreed to the retention of such counsel or              

    (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded
        parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
          Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would
       be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests
between them.                                           

A successor by law of the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to the    
benefits of the indemnification contained in this Article VI. The               
indemnification provisions contained in this Article VI shall survive any       
termination of this Agreement.

upon the business and operations of the Company; or                             

(g)  at the option of the Fund or the Underwriter if the Fund or the Underwriter
respectively, shall determine in its sole judgment exercised in good faith, that
the Company has suffered a material adverse change in its business, operations  
or financial condition since the date of this Agreement or is the subject of    
material adverse publicity which is likely to have a material adverse impact    
upon the business and operations of the Fund or Underwriter.                    

8.2  Notice Requirement

8.4  Effect of Termination                                                      

(a)  Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section      
8.1(a) through 8.1(g) of this Agreement and subject to Section 1.2 of this      
Agreement, the Company may require the Fund and the Underwriter to continue to

of this Agreement as the Company desire pursuant to the terms and conditions of 
this Agreement as provided in paragraph (b) below, for all Contracts in effect  
on the effective date of termination of this Agreement (hereinafter referred to

by law, regulation or an applicable regulatory body. Specifically, without      
limitation, the owners of the Existing Contracts shall be permitted to direct

termination. This Agreement, or any provision thereof, shall survive the        
termination to the extent necessary for each party to perform its obligations   
with respect to shares for which a fee continues to be due subsequent to such   
termination.

With respect to any and all transactions in Class C or R Shares of the Funds    
pursuant to this Amendment, it is understood and agreed in each case that unless

          to which you are subject and that the transactions contemplated by
            this Agreement will not result in any violations of any banking law,
           rule or regulation, and (b) exempt from registration under the 1934
  Act as a broker-dealer and will continue to be exempt from
         registration as long as this Agreement is in effect. You agree to

Hartford Life Insurance Company General Account













































Summary


Information on this investment option was provided by your plan sponsor, plan trustee,  investment manager, trustee or third party data provider.  This investment is not a mutual fund.Information on this investment option was provided by your plan sponsor, plan trustee,  investment manager, trustee or third party data provider.  This investment is not a mutual fund.



















Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks to provide a competitive credited rate of interest while providing a minimum guaranteed interest rate over the lifetime of the contract.




Strategy



The General Account portfolio for this product consists of government securities, corporate securities and short term investments.


Risk



The fund is backed by a diversified portfolio of fixed-income assets held in the general account of the issuer. Guarantees are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuer.  Restrictions or fees may apply to exchanges or withdrawals.  The Contracts provide for the payment of certain withdrawals and exchanges at book value during the terms of the Contracts. In order to maintain the Contract issuers' promise to pay such withdrawals and exchanges at book value, the Contracts subject the fund and its participants to certain restrictions. For example, withdrawals prompted by certain events (e.g., layoffs, early retirement windows, spin-offs, sale of a division, facility closings, plan terminations, partial plan terminations, changes in laws or regulations) may be paid at the market value of the fund's securities, which may be less than your book value balance or may restrict withdrawals in these events.
Certain investment options offered by your plan (e.g., money market funds, short term bond funds, certain asset allocation/lifecycle funds and brokerage window) may be deemed by the Contract issuers to "compete" with this fund. The terms of the Contracts prohibit you from making a direct exchange from this fund to such competing funds. Instead, you must first exchange to a non-competing fund for 90 days. While these requirements may seem restrictive, they are imposed by the Contract issuers as a condition for the issuer's promise to pay certain withdrawals and exchanges at book value.



Short Term Redemption Fee
None



Who May Want To Invest

All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
