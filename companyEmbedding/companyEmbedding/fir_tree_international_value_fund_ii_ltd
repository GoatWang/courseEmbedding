Fir Tree Partners Raises $628 Million for Real Estate Opportunity Fund II

NEW YORK, Nov. 8, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Fir Tree Partners, a private investment firm with approximately $7 billion of capital under management, recently announced the final close of its Real Estate Opportunity Fund II ("Fund II"), with $628 million of committed capital, exceeding its original target of $500 million.  
Fir Tree's first real estate opportunity fund was formed in 2008 to provide the Firm's existing investors with more concentrated real estate exposure.  Fund II seeks to create a strategic advantage for existing and new Fir Tree investors through a broad investment mandate across capital structures in both the commercial and residential real estate markets.  
James Walker III, a Managing Partner at Fir Tree and co-founder of the firm's real estate funds, stated: "The volatile capital markets continue to change the opportunity set.  Our flexible mandate empowers us to benefit from these changes and is bolstered by patient capital, firm expertise, and the ability to target both public and private investments."   
Fir Tree primarily pursues an activist strategy in real estate, creating value through workouts, restructurings and operational improvements. 
"Last year, we found compelling opportunities to restructure real estate companies; this year, acquiring defaulted first mortgages has been an attractive way to craft a historically cheap basis in assets we'd like to own," said Jarret Cohen, Head of Private Real Estate at Fir Tree.  
The firm's real estate funds seek to uncover scalable themes that offer downside protection and are less reliant on improvements in asset values or operating fundamentals.  Fir Tree has historically focused its real estate efforts on areas largely ignored by the more traditional institutional investor universe, often through senior positions in misunderstood or out-of-favor sectors.  Fund II is more than 90% invested in a variety of loans, real assets and securities.   
About Fir Tree Partners 
Fir Tree Partners, founded in 1994 and located in New York, NY (HQ) and Miami, FL, is a private investment firm, which manages approximately $7 billion of assets on behalf of leading endowments, foundations, public and private pension funds and other institutional and private investors.  Fir Tree invests worldwide in public and private companies and real estate across a wide variety of sectors and securities.

 Fir Tree Portfolio Company Quotes on Positive Activism®






AES Corporation (AES: NYSE)



	
						                            "I have always appreciated Fir Tree's thoughtful advice, which we took into consideration when we adopted a new capital allocation strategy when I was named CEO of the AES Corporation in September of 2011."
								                
Andres Gluski, President and CEO






Capmark Financial Group Inc. (CPMK: OTC US)



	
						                            “The Fir Tree team has been a value-add creditor.  They participated in numerous settlement negotiations throughout the restructuring process which facilitated the company’s success post emergence.”
								                
Bill Gallagher,  President and CEO






CIT Group Inc. (CIT: NYSE)



	
						                            "Fir Tree was a constructive voice in a complex and challenging restructuring."
								                
Jeffrey Peek, former Chief Executive Officer






Echelon International Corp (formerly EIN: NYSE)




"Fir Tree asked if I would serve on the board to Echelon, a real estate development company located in Florida. Working with management, substantial value was created and the company was sold profitably to a third-party."
Stephen Blank, former Fir Tree representative to Echelon Board of Directors






Encore Acquisition Co. (formerly EAC: NASDAQ)



	
						                            "Owning nearly 10% of Encore Acquisition at the time, Fir Tree supported us on a number of strategic fronts including a shareholder repurchase plan and MLP formation for our long lived assets that created tremendous shareholder value." 
								                
Jonny Brumley,  Chief Executive Officer






FGIC Corporation



	
						                            "Fir Tree led the ad hoc  group of investors in FGIC insured bonds through an innovative restructuring over the last three years that will likely serve as a blueprint for the industry going forward.  The rehabilitation plan was a 'win-win' for all parties and Fir Tree was a valued partner to our management team."
								                
John S. Dubel, Chief Executive Officer






Lehman Brothers (formerly LEH: NYSE)



	
						                            Fir Tree helped design and lead an innovative board design and selection process for what is now the largest bankruptcy in history. Incentives were put in place to align interests and empower the board to increase the overall value of the estate on an expedited basis. Fir Tree, a hedge-fund creditor that helped select the directors, said in statement that it tried to "attract best in class directors who will work to maximize value" for Lehman creditors. Fir Tree said it looked for people who are "highly respected in a range of critical areas, including real estate, derivatives, private equity and restructuring." Wall Street Journal, December 5, 2011 Lehman says its "active board" approach resembles a private equity board and says its new directors were recruited to work closely with the team that has been managing its still considerable real-estate holdings.…"Given the highly results-oriented nature of this compensation package, …I would say this is an eminently reasonable package and likely to deliver more value to debtors…," said Paul Hodgson, compensation expert at GMI Ratings. Dow Jones, March 19, 2012







Nextel Communications (formerly NXTL: NASDAQ)



	
						                            “Fir Tree approached Nextel with an inventive debt for equity swap that greatly improved our company’s financial strength."
								                
Dennis Weibling,  former Chief Executive Officer






Plains Exploration & Production Company (formerly PXP: NYSE)



	
						                            "As a large owner of our company in 2007, through a series of constructive dialogues, we worked with Fir Tree on a shareholder value creation program that was implemented following a large company acquisition."
								                
James Flores,  Chief Executive Officer






Powerhouse Technologies, Inc. (formerly PWRH: NASDAQ)



	
						                            "Fir Tree’s long term view and support of my management team was a critical component of our successful turnaround.  It was refreshing to have a major investor with both highly constructive ideas and a long term view."
								                
Richard Haddrill,  Chairman of the Board and former Chief Executive Officer






R.H. Donnelly Corp (formerly RHD: NYSE)



	
						                            "In 2000 I was appointed to the RH Donnelley board as Fir Tree’s representative.   At the time Donnelley was the largest yellow page business in the US and it had recently been spun  off from its parent company, Dun & Bradstreet.  This was a time when the Internet began to emerge as a game changing technological threat and so my focus for value creation centered on tech initiatives and ensuring that capital allocation was done to maximize shareholder value."
								                
Darius Gaskins, former Fir Tree representative to RH Donnelly Board of Directors






Rite Aid Corporation (RAD: NYSE)



	
						                            "I first met the Fir Tree team when they were large holders of Rite-Aid debt and they approached me with an innovative debt-for-equity swap proposal.  We ended up completing many debt-for-equity swaps with Fir Tree which both helped us deleverage and provided us with the financial flexibility to grow our business."
								                
Dave Jessick,  former Chief Financial Officer






Syncora Guarantee Inc. (SYCRF: OTC US)



	
						                            "We have worked with Fir Tree on a number of inventive restructuring transactions for us, and they have been a good partner.  They provided constructive support to our management team and were quick to commit large sums of capital to complex deals."
								                
Claude LeBlanc,  Chief Restructuring Officer 






The Official Information Company (formerly TCM: NYSE)



	
						                            “The principals at Fir Tree were instrumental partners in the growth and development of The Official Information Company.  Their smart and constructive advice helped us develop, finance and execute a growth plan that created five separate operating businesses which were later sold in multiple value-enhancing transactions on behalf of our shareholders.”
								                
Ian Thomas,  former Chief Executive Officer






W.P. Carey Inc. (WPC: NYSE)



	
						                            "Fir Tree's meaningful suggestions regarding our dividend policy and information disclosures were enormously helpful.  We believe they significantly enhanced shareholder value."
								                
Trevor Bond, Chief Executive Officer

Caribbean Capers: “Humane Society” Stuffs $26 Million in Offshore Funds


It’s hard for the Humane Society of the United States to save animals when it has parked $26 million offshore. That’s what readers of USA Today are learning with our full-page ad in the paper this morning.
The Humane Society of the United States scandalously only gives 1% of its budget to local pet shelters, and it doesn’t run any pet shelters of its own. But it has plenty of money to bury in the sand. Deep in HSUS’s latest tax return is the group’s admission that it made “investments” totaling $25.7 million in the “Central American and the Caribbean” region. There were no reported investments of any kind abroad in HSUS’s previous three years of tax returns.
Why is a group that pledges to rescue animals in need quietly burying $26 million in Caribbean accounts? And where exactly is this $26 million “invested”?
It turns out HSUS funneled mega-bucks to several funds located in the Cayman Islands. The secretive place where secretive people stuff their secretive money. Bond villain-type stuff. According to its 990-T and supplemental forms, HSUS made the following “investments”:

$500,000 to Ascend Partners Fund I, L.P., a Cayman hedge fund
$253,000 to BKM Holdings (Cayman) Ltd.
$8 million to Fore Multi Strategy Offshore Fund, Ltd., in the Caymans
$5 million to Hayman Capital Offshore Partners, L.P. in Bermuda
$6.7 million invested in Fir Tree International Value Fund in the Caymans

Why would a U.S. charity be putting $26 million in the Caribbean? (And the figures above only add up to a little over $20 million—where’s the other $5 million?) HSUS is a non-profit. It’s not in the business of investing money in hedge funds to make a profit. It’s in the business—according to its ads—of saving animals now. Now means right away—not in 10 years when HSUS may have made a loss on its Caribbean investments. (HSUS reports losing $61,000 in 2012 on various partnerships in the 990-T.)
There’s a reason people write “H$U$.” It’s because money seems to come first for the cynics and the bean-counters running HSUS. And it’s one more reason to give to your local shelter directly, not to a questionable national organization that might stick your donations in the Caymans instead of helping the shelter pets it cynically uses in its ads.

shameful. even more shameful is the f
act that our legal system allows them to continue to collect money from sponsors who don’t understand where their donations are actually going. if people want to donate money..please be responsible enough to put your money into the real rescue groups ( local animal shelters). don’t make those money grubbing terrorist organizations rich.






Susie Fox Lampkin



When my father passed we donated over 4 trucks loads of new clothes, shoes and household items in great condition to the HSUS. I am really saddened by this information. I thought they were the only charity that actually used the money the way they said they did. I will not donate another dime to them. Shame on you!!!!!!!






Doreen M Connors-Sulger



I can only hope this exposure of these rotten people will eliminate contributions. Government is turning a blind eye. Kind of reminds you of the blind eyes they’ve turned on banking.






tedtrent



Animal rescue is all about mom and pop organizations or businesses.






Anne



Here we go again. Is there even one honest American alive in this world? I doubt it.
