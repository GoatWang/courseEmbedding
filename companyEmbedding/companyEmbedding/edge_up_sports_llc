Edge Up Sports: Fantasy Football Can Be Fun Again!




Kansas City, MO

Software






$53,497


pledged of $35,000 goal




1,296


backers











We met and exceeded our initial $35,000 goal in a few short days! With this great pace, participation, and encouragement from our founding user team we are setting a stretch goal! To deliver on our vision of making fantasy football fun again we will bring #videosmacktalking capabilities to our founding user team if we can reach $65,000 before the close of our Kickstarter project.Today if you want to talk some smack on your friends and family you are forced to go to a tiny mobile keyboard to peck away a message for the discussion board. We can do better! Record, manage, and share your best one liners privately or publicly directly from the Edge Up Sports platform. Help us reach our $65,000 stretch goal and level up your smack talking with video this season!




It's 2015 and your life is automated and assisted by technology every day! Why isn't this happening for fantasy football? We are building the best fantasy football tools and inviting you to join our founding team of users.Want to know how well a player does on grass vs. turf? Curious if their head is in the right place before a big rivalry? Those are just a couple of the questions we want to answer, and we’ll keep going deeper throughout the season into future seasons.




Edge Up is a mobile-first platform (available on both Android and iOS), with responsive web experiences designed for tablet and desktop.You will be able to choose from two platform options.Edge Up Standard TierStats, Matchups, Weather. There is a bunch of stuff to stay on top of every week during the fantasy football season. We make it easy by bringing you the information you need to stay on top of your roster and watch list. This tier includes statistics and social information organized in 3 dimensions (mental, physical, situational) for players on your roster and others that may be of interest. Get a quick intuitive view and spend a quarter of the time while being more informed.




Edge Up Cognitive TierThe cognitive tier includes the functionality of the standard tier. Further, we have used IBM Watson technology to process a wide sampling of analysis available around the NFL to bring you a view of what's happening. Previously you would have to ask a friend that had just spent a couple of hours reading articles from a wide variety of football analysts. Now the sentiment of the analysis toward players on your roster can be seen in the palm of your hand. You will also be able to see how this has trended over a period of weeks. Not knowing the analyst who wrote a particular article won't be a problem as our profiles let you know if they tend to be optimistic in their analysis. This tier will also include participation in question and answer interaction about football which will only get better throughout this and subsequent seasons.





We have worked for months and built multiple prototypes to put in front of a variety of fantasy football managers to improve usability and experience.


Concept to multiple prototypes to launch.


It is now time to ask for YOUR help as an engaged founding user so that together we can continue to enhance the ultimate tools for fantasy football managers everywhere for the 2015 season and beyond!


Insights in the palm of your hand.


The core insights our mobile-first platform features are mental, physical and situational, which pulls from social media interactions, weather reports, injury history, analyst write-ups, news stories and more.


Get a sense of how analysts feel, not just a list of articles to read.


We have created tools using technologies from IBM Watson to allow you to analyze a wide variety of league news and dig into the personality of the analysts. This functionality will be included in the cognitive tier.




We are asking for your support so we can launch our platform with you! By joining our founding user team, we can build the ultimate fantasy football platform together that will allow you to focus on what you want. Technology is always better when it's built for and with input from people who will ultimately use it. We started this journey, but need your insight to continue to evolve the ultimate fantasy football analytics platform. For your support and early participation, we’ll lock you in for a deep discount (50% or higher if you get one of the early-bird rewards) over the full price of the platform. You will continue to enjoy these discounts in future seasons as a member of the founding user team. Let's make fantasy football fun again, Kickstarters.




Kickstarter gives a wide and tech-forward audience the chance to be a part of this project. We're inviting you to go behind the scenes and be a part of the process. All backers will receive regular updates on the process and can follow along each step of the way.




What happens when a great team in an awesome creative community gets together to take on an interesting problem? It's simple, awesome results.


Making Fantasy Football Fun Again!







Spending way too much time keeping up with college friends in a fantasy football league for more than 12 years. Enough is enough!Football is huge in America! Playing and being more competitive against millions of Americans who are NFL fans and play fantasy football creates a new way to connect with a large cross section of America. This includes your college buddies and co-workers.


America is obsessed with football.


A couple members of our team had the exact problem of spending time aggregating information instead of making decisions and having fun bantering with friends (this might sound familiar to you). With the rest of life becoming more automated, it was time to do the same with the fantasy football routine. 




What started as a conversation over beers with a friend about how useful it would be to deploy modern technology to gain deeper insight into fantasy football rosters has turned into a journey to make fantasy football fun again.


It's been an interesting journey thus far!










Appearances and Coverage


Ars Technica, Wired, Fast Company, Motherboard, NBC, Esquire, PC World, CIO, Quartz, CNN Money, Tech.co, World of Watson - The New Disruptors Panel, Startland News, and Others!It's been amazing discussing the potential of our approach and watching the excitement that an interesting idea can generate!




The team brings to bear a wide mix of skills that allow us to bite into quite a few areas, extensive experience in UX, front-end, data science, physiology, engineering. From designers to engineers to a former football player, our team has it all.


A great team can build great things together.







It hasn't been strictly all work on our end. We've had a great time building an awesome product! We've also made some fun content to share with the world. There will be more to come.













Risks and challenges
We worked hard to build the absolute best interface and user experience found among all of the various fantasy football tools. In order to deliver the absolute best, we’re reaching out now to connect with fantasy football players who value their time and believe the fantasy football experience can be much better (that’s you). To accomplish our goals we are using some of the best tools out there and partnering with some amazing organizations to connect with interesting data sets and process them. It is possible that some of these relationships may face difficulties as we continue to push at the boundaries of what's possible. Further, as we continue to include a wider number of data sets, it may become difficult to gain access as quickly as we have managed thus far. We have built strong relationships along the way, but this will remain a challenge as we grow our information footprint.
Significant effort has been focused to verify that our product is stable and performs well for our users. Although we have made every effort to ensure that we have built a solid product, as we bring on the first engaged group of users for the 2015 season complications may occur.
Generally, we are continuing to add data sources and processing more and more information. Our architecture is consistently computing larger amounts of information to make your fantasy football week easier. We’ll have to be diligent to make sure we’re scaling the footprint of our product in lock step with all of the awesome functionality we plan to add.
Because of the tight turnaround between the campaign and the regular season, we’ll have to be diligent with getting access to our supporters. We’ll need your help in order to make this a smooth process.

 Additional Details 












The Premier Sports Shelter is designed around the “6 Seater Bench” for the purpose of side line Soccer. But its uses are limitless, made to protect you, your team, family or anything else from the weather. Its dome shape design is a mix between a Pop-Up Canopy and a tent. The shelter covers you on four sides and still gives you sight out of the shelter and easy access into the shelter. The “Side Flaps” unzip and allow for ventilation and viewing out of the sides of the shelter. Three “Back Flaps” unzip and allow more ventilation and access into the back of the shelter where you could store sporting gear, camping supplies or any other equipment. On both sides there are “J Hooks” were you can hang a backpack, bag or heavy object. There are four “Webbing Loops” on each corner of the shelter were you can stake down or place weight bags to secure the shelter to the ground. The shelter comes in a carrying bag with instructions and four 9” steel spikes (Weight Bags sold separately). Place an order online, email or call us now to get your very own Premier Sports Shelter!

Our Story 
In September of 2008, four friends got together for 2 nights of dinner and conversation.  We had known each other for about 10 years by that time.  We kicked around the idea of going into business for ourselves during those nights, and in December of that same year, Keeper Sports Products, LLC was born!
Mark had started a shortened career in retail out of college in 1980 on Nantucket Island.  Scott began shaping bodyboards in Southern California while attending college in 1981.  The bodyboard company whom Scott was working for in 1986, was bought by a company in Hyannis, Massachusetts.  Mark joined that company in 1987.  One on the west coast, the other on the east coast, we joined forces with Charlie and Michael 21 years later.
Mark worked out of his home for the first 7 years while Scott opened our first office in Oceanside in 2009.  Mark handled the sales and marketing while Scott designed our product line from bodyboards to surf and SUP boards to winter snow sleds, while running the operations side.  Charlie and Michael handled the prototypes, testing, packaging and ultimately all of the production.
We hired our first assistant in 2011.  As the years grew, our family grew.   Dugie and Chuckie, long time industry veterans and good friends, were among the first to join us.  Our rep base grew with long time buddies like Stretch, KB, Sully, Jamie, Pete & Paul, the Walrus and Giff and Schifty and most recently, Kyle.  Each one of them instrumental in getting us from “there” to “here”.
Along the way, we picked-up the brilliant G-Man, who’s designs and artwork are now world renowned.  Willy mentored us in business throughout while John balanced the legal side until we could branch out. It may be the four partners getting the handshakes at the shows, but we know it’s Helen, Mary, Tyler, Amber, Eddy, Chelsea and Ryan that keep our ship floating and moving forward – along with the rest of our team.
We pride ourselves in making a quality product that our many loyal retail customers can buy for a fair price and extend that value to the most important people of all . . . our extended family . . . our consumers.  We are equally proud to present to you our new website, authored by Tyler but assisted by many and ask that you share it and our story with your family and friends.
Warmest Regards,
Mark, Scott, Charlie and Michael
If it’s made by us . . . it’s a Keeper!

Testimonials 





ISUPworld.com"The new Scott Burke inflatable SUP is awesome. It’s a winner right out of the box." Burke 11’ Quest Inflatable SUP Review"The new Scott Burke inflatable SUP is awesome. It’s a winner right out of the box.
I love the colors and look of this board. The PVC material on top is made to look like wood and the green and black traction pad looks really sharp in contrast.
The shape and design make it very versatile for all different types of water and the size makes it easy for anyone to use from small to large, beginner to advanced.
It is not the fastest board out there but it glides nicely, tracks well and is really easy to paddle.
The 11’ Quest was an instant favorite with my team as far as all-round board designs go."

Dick's Sporting Goods Customer Review"Lovin' this board." CBC Foam 10'6 Stand Up Paddle Board Rewiew"Love this board. I'm a beginner. This is a great board for my family, twin 5 year olds, 17 year old and wife. Entire top is soft. Great construction. Well made. Easy to carry. Old school wood "look" is awesome. Very stable...moves nicely through the water. Nothing poor quality about this board. I'd love to try the fishing one."

ISUPworld.com"A smaller sized board can be a lot of fun to use and this Burke 9’ Quest ISUP is exactly that… fun!" Burke 9’ Quest Inflatable SUP Review"A smaller sized board can be a lot of fun to use and this Burke 9’ Quest ISUP is exactly that… fun!
This board feels very responsive, it turns quickly and takes very little effort to get moving.
We found that it plowed through chop and wind with ease and although it won’t keep up with a longer and more streamlined touring SUP, it definitely did not feel sluggish.
The lightweight keeps it very portable and convenient to take anywhere.
Although the 9’ Quest can in fact hold quite a bit of weight it is also small enough that it can easily be paddled by a smaller person or a child as well."
CLICK TO READ THE FULL REVIEW  The Wet LifeThe foam construction also means that the board is lightweight, weighing only 25 lbs, which is excellent for easy maneuverability. CBC 10'6" Stand Up Paddle Board ReviewIf you are new to paddle boarding you may have had some serious sticker shock.  Paddle boards average in price around $1000 and can reach prices in the many thousands of dollars.  No way can a beginner be expected to fork over that kind of money, especially if they aren’t even sure about the sport yet.

Fortunately, you may have found a board on Amazon or Dicks Sporting Goods from a company called California Board Company that is half the cost of most boards, but at such a steep discount can the board be any good?  Is this thing going to sink like a rock when I launch it in the water?  Will this board crack in half if I strap it too tight to the roof of my car?  Even with a cheap board like the, California Board Company 10 six, we need answers.

We met and exceeded our initial $35,000 goal in a few short days! With this great pace, participation, and encouragement from our founding user team we are setting a stretch goal! To deliver on our vision of making fantasy football fun again we will bring #videosmacktalking capabilities to our founding user team if we can reach $65,000 before the close of our Kickstarter project.Today if you want to talk some smack on your friends and family you are forced to go to a tiny mobile keyboard to peck away a message for the discussion board. We can do better! Record, manage, and share your best one liners privately or publicly directly from the Edge Up Sports platform. Help us reach our $65,000 stretch goal and level up your smack talking with video this season!




It's 2015 and your life is automated and assisted by technology every day! Why isn't this happening for fantasy football? We are building the best fantasy football tools and inviting you to join our founding team of users.Want to know how well a player does on grass vs. turf? Curious if their head is in the right place before a big rivalry? Those are just a couple of the questions we want to answer, and we’ll keep going deeper throughout the season into future seasons.




Edge Up is a mobile-first platform (available on both Android and iOS), with responsive web experiences designed for tablet and desktop.You will be able to choose from two platform options.Edge Up Standard TierStats, Matchups, Weather. There is a bunch of stuff to stay on top of every week during the fantasy football season. We make it easy by bringing you the information you need to stay on top of your roster and watch list. This tier includes statistics and social information organized in 3 dimensions (mental, physical, situational) for players on your roster and others that may be of interest. Get a quick intuitive view and spend a quarter of the time while being more informed.




Edge Up Cognitive TierThe cognitive tier includes the functionality of the standard tier. Further, we have used IBM Watson technology to process a wide sampling of analysis available around the NFL to bring you a view of what's happening. Previously you would have to ask a friend that had just spent a couple of hours reading articles from a wide variety of football analysts. Now the sentiment of the analysis toward players on your roster can be seen in the palm of your hand. You will also be able to see how this has trended over a period of weeks. Not knowing the analyst who wrote a particular article won't be a problem as our profiles let you know if they tend to be optimistic in their analysis. This tier will also include participation in question and answer interaction about football which will only get better throughout this and subsequent seasons.





We have worked for months and built multiple prototypes to put in front of a variety of fantasy football managers to improve usability and experience.


Concept to multiple prototypes to launch.


It is now time to ask for YOUR help as an engaged founding user so that together we can continue to enhance the ultimate tools for fantasy football managers everywhere for the 2015 season and beyond!


Insights in the palm of your hand.


The core insights our mobile-first platform features are mental, physical and situational, which pulls from social media interactions, weather reports, injury history, analyst write-ups, news stories and more.


Get a sense of how analysts feel, not just a list of articles to read.


We have created tools using technologies from IBM Watson to allow you to analyze a wide variety of league news and dig into the personality of the analysts. This functionality will be included in the cognitive tier.




We are asking for your support so we can launch our platform with you! By joining our founding user team, we can build the ultimate fantasy football platform together that will allow you to focus on what you want. Technology is always better when it's built for and with input from people who will ultimately use it. We started this journey, but need your insight to continue to evolve the ultimate fantasy football analytics platform. For your support and early participation, we’ll lock you in for a deep discount (50% or higher if you get one of the early-bird rewards) over the full price of the platform. You will continue to enjoy these discounts in future seasons as a member of the founding user team. Let's make fantasy football fun again, Kickstarters.




Kickstarter gives a wide and tech-forward audience the chance to be a part of this project. We're inviting you to go behind the scenes and be a part of the process. All backers will receive regular updates on the process and can follow along each step of the way.




What happens when a great team in an awesome creative community gets together to take on an interesting problem? It's simple, awesome results.


Making Fantasy Football Fun Again!







Spending way too much time keeping up with college friends in a fantasy football league for more than 12 years. Enough is enough!Football is huge in America! Playing and being more competitive against millions of Americans who are NFL fans and play fantasy football creates a new way to connect with a large cross section of America. This includes your college buddies and co-workers.


America is obsessed with football.


A couple members of our team had the exact problem of spending time aggregating information instead of making decisions and having fun bantering with friends (this might sound familiar to you). With the rest of life becoming more automated, it was time to do the same with the fantasy football routine. 




What started as a conversation over beers with a friend about how useful it would be to deploy modern technology to gain deeper insight into fantasy football rosters has turned into a journey to make fantasy football fun again.


It's been an interesting journey thus far!










Appearances and Coverage


Ars Technica, Wired, Fast Company, Motherboard, NBC, Esquire, PC World, CIO, Quartz, CNN Money, Tech.co, World of Watson - The New Disruptors Panel, Startland News, and Others!It's been amazing discussing the potential of our approach and watching the excitement that an interesting idea can generate!




The team brings to bear a wide mix of skills that allow us to bite into quite a few areas, extensive experience in UX, front-end, data science, physiology, engineering. From designers to engineers to a former football player, our team has it all.


A great team can build great things together.







It hasn't been strictly all work on our end. We've had a great time building an awesome product! We've also made some fun content to share with the world. There will be more to come.













Risks and challenges
We worked hard to build the absolute best interface and user experience found among all of the various fantasy football tools. In order to deliver the absolute best, we’re reaching out now to connect with fantasy football players who value their time and believe the fantasy football experience can be much better (that’s you). To accomplish our goals we are using some of the best tools out there and partnering with some amazing organizations to connect with interesting data sets and process them. It is possible that some of these relationships may face difficulties as we continue to push at the boundaries of what's possible. Further, as we continue to include a wider number of data sets, it may become difficult to gain access as quickly as we have managed thus far. We have built strong relationships along the way, but this will remain a challenge as we grow our information footprint.
Significant effort has been focused to verify that our product is stable and performs well for our users. Although we have made every effort to ensure that we have built a solid product, as we bring on the first engaged group of users for the 2015 season complications may occur.
Generally, we are continuing to add data sources and processing more and more information. Our architecture is consistently computing larger amounts of information to make your fantasy football week easier. We’ll have to be diligent to make sure we’re scaling the footprint of our product in lock step with all of the awesome functionality we plan to add.
Because of the tight turnaround between the campaign and the regular season, we’ll have to be diligent with getting access to our supporters. We’ll need your help in order to make this a smooth process.
