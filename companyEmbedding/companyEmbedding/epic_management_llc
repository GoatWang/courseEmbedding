A Visionary’s Approach to Rehabilitation:
"There is a movement to make nursing homes 'like home', but our patients/residents are smart. They know that 'home' is the place where they raised their children and that a nursing facility is not that place. However, everyone loves being in a hotel and that luxury hotel atmosphere is something that we at EPIC work hard to replicate."

  Mark Neuman CFO
