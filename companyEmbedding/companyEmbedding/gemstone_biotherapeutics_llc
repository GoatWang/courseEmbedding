Gemstone Biotherapeutics Completes Second Funding Round



Share Article


















Capital Supports Regulatory Submittals and Initial Clinical Trials of Company’s Advanced Wound Care Therapeutic Product








The potential to revolutionize the wound care industry is incredibly exciting.


Baltimore, MD (PRWEB)
June 08, 2015
 Gemstone Biotherapeutics LLC announced the completion of a second funding round that resulted in a capital raise of $1.6 million. Founding investor Gamma 3 LLC led the additional investment, which also included participation from an international healthcare fund. This latest round brings the total seed funding raised to $2.45 million. The additional funding will support further testing, regulatory submittals and initial clinical trials of the company’s biosynthetic scaffold technology. The technology is targeted for the management of a variety of chronic and acute wounds. 
Gemstone Bio was founded in 2013 by Gamma 3 LLC, based on technology developed by Dr. Sharon Gerecht and licensed from John Hopkins University, and is dedicated to the field of regenerative medicine. The company’s full patent portfolio includes core technologies that utilize cell engineering methods and biomaterials to promote vascularization, a critical component in advanced tissue repair and regeneration. Gemstone Bio’s initial therapeutic product is a biosynthetic scaffold for advanced wound healing applications. In initial animal testing, the scaffold demonstrated unprecedented results in its ability to heal full-thickness wounds with complete skin regeneration and minimal to no visible scarring after burn trauma.
“The potential to revolutionize the wound care industry is incredibly exciting for our investors, our industry and, most significantly, for patients with chronic and acute wounds,” said George Davis, CEO of Gemstone Biotherapeutics. “This latest round of funding will enable us to more aggressively pursue major regulatory and clinical milestones. These include securing the human and physical resources needed to achieve our commercialization objectives. The results of recently completed Gemstone Bio-sponsored scientific studies of the scaffold technology provide additional confidence that our solution is on the right track.”
“It is very exciting and rewarding to see the inventions that were originally developed in our labs at Johns Hopkins University have such a clear path to commercial viability and therapeutic application,” said Dr. Sharon Gerecht, associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the JHU Whiting School of Engineering and co-founder and lead advisor of Gemstone Bio.

Gemstone Biotherapeutics Licenses Additional Johns Hopkins Wound Care Technology



Share Article


















License includes promising therapy for chronic wounds in diabetic and older patients








This promising technology has the potential to benefit millions of patients in need.


Baltimore, Maryland (PRWEB)
February 18, 2016
 Gemstone Biotherapeutics LLC (Gemstone Bio), a Baltimore-based regenerative medicine company, has exclusively licensed new wound-healing technology from Johns Hopkins University. 
The technology, pioneered by Jeremy Walston, M.D., co-director of Johns Hopkins’ Biology of Healthy Aging Program and professor of medicine at the university’s School of Medicine, and Peter Abadir, M.D., assistant professor of medicine at the School of Medicine, has the potential to provide patients who are older and have chronic wounds due to diabetes with a treatment option superior to current products. The product will target diabetic foot ulcers, a growing and costly health care dilemma. 
The new license will allow Gemstone Bio to develop and commercialize advanced wound-healing solutions. 
“Gemstone Bio’s original, advanced wound care technology was developed by Johns Hopkins researchers,” says George Davis, chief executive officer of Gemstone Bio. “We are familiar with the depth of research used to create these quality solutions. Based on initial results of studies in animals, this new discovery offers a promising solution that will be well-positioned for a significant share in the multibillion-dollar advanced wound care market and add significant prowess to our portfolio.”
Of the 29 million Americans with diabetes, approximately 1.5 million will experience diabetic foot ulcers each year. The annual cost to heal these chronic wounds is estimated at $25 billion in the United States. Globally, the estimated number of people with diabetic foot ulcers is over 20 million. This number is expected to climb as the population ages and the incidence of diabetes increases. Left untreated, diabetic foot ulcers can lead to more serious conditions, such as sepsis, amputations and even death. 
Walston and Abadir have identified a mitochondrial angiotensin receptor system that becomes less functional with age. This system likely contributes to age and disease-related declines in multiple tissue types. Doctors also discovered that angiotensin receptor blockers, a category of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for hypertension, can reinvigorate this system. Building on these unique discoveries, they developed a topical agent targeting the biology that inhibits wound healing in patients who are older and have diabetes. 
“This promising technology has the potential to benefit the millions of patients in need,” added Davis.  "By licensing this technology, Gemstone Bio is in a position to take this novel technology from lab to bedside much more quickly by working through clinical trials and regulatory processes.” 
In conjunction with this newly licensed technology, Gemstone Bio is proceeding with trials and regulatory approvals for its existing biosynthetic scaffold, which has shown to improve wound healing in a study published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.

Gemstone Bio’s Technology
Gemstone Bio utilizes exclusively-licensed core technology that was developed at Johns Hopkins University. The IP portfolio comprises a unique mix of innovative products and techniques. Our technology boasts a wide-range of regenerative medicine applications, including wound healing scaffolds and topical therapeutics.






Scaffold Technology

 
Polymer-based scaffolds are extensively used in regenerative medicine applications because they provide a three-dimensional structure that simulates the native cell environment and extracellular matrix. Gemstone's first generation product is a novel biosynthetic scaffold for wound healing. Gemstone's scaffolds highly tunable, meaning they can easily be tailored for specific wound healing applications. The incorporation of active ingredients, including therapeutics, cells and growth factors, allow for continuous scaffold evolution.



Topical Therapeutic

 
Researchers at Johns Hopkins have discovered that a well-known category of  medications have a profoundly positive impact on the healing of chronic wounds via several specific biological mechanisms. This research is based on prior evidence that certain receptors are markedly increased in the wounds of older and diabetic patients. Increased levels of this pro-inflammatory receptor play a critical role in skin vulnerability, poor wound healing and the development of chronic wounds. 




    Our advanced wound care technologies are destined to disrupt the field of regenerative medicine and wound healing.



Published Papers
Gemstone Bio's technology is published in a variety of high-impact journals. Our science is subjected to rigorous peer-review to ensure scientific integrity and verifiable results.

A bicellular vascular population, capable of maturing into ECs and pericytes, was derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). These EVCs were able to self-organize and form microvascular networks in an engineered matrix, which survives implantation, integrates with the host vasculature, and establishes blood flow.

A biosynthetic scaffold containing no additional growth factors, cytokines, or cells was developed that promotes neovascularization and skin regeneration in third-degree burn wounds in mice. Dermal regeneration with complete skin appendages was observed after 3 weeks. After 5 weeks, new hair growth and normal epidermal morphology and thickness were observed.
