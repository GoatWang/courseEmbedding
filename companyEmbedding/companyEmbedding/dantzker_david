Signals for Survival
Marc Dantzker and David O. Brown
Sinauer Associates is an imprint of Oxford University Press

From Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology and the Shoals Marine Laboratory, this DVD documents with startling clarity the communication system of Great Black-backed and Herring Gulls. It is a perfect adjunct to courses in animal behavior, animal communication, and behavioral ecology. While it builds on the theme of the classic Lesser Black-backed Gull film by Nobel Laureate Niko Tinbergen, the logic and presentation are framed within current concepts and principles. Beautifully filmed at the Shoals Marine Laboratory in Maine and accessibly narrated, the core 38-minute presentation is divided into self-contained chapters entitled "Territoriality and Aggression," "Courtship and Mating," and "Parental Care." Additional content on the DVD includes a licensed high-quality copy of the original 1968 Tinbergen film, soundscapes from the breeding colony, and a short commentary by Dr. Thomas D. Seeley (Cornell University) describing the significance of Tinbergen's pioneering work on gull communication.

The Cornell Lab of Ornithology has granted free access to the BNA species accounts for both Herring and Great Black-backed Gulls, the species covered in the Signals for Survival film. These accounts will give instructors and students access to the background ecology, systematics, and life history, as well as additional behavioral descriptions for these species.

About this product
This disc is protected to play on players that are encoded for certain regions, and might not work in other countries. For more information, please consult the FAQ.New from Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology and the Shoals Marine Laboratory, this DVD documents with startling clarity the communication system of Greater Black-backed and Herring gulls. It is a perfect adjunct to courses in animal behavior, animal communication, and behavioral ecology.  While it builds on the theme of the classic herring gull film by Nobel Laureate Niko Tinbergen, the logic and presentation are framed within current concepts and principles. Beautifully filmed at the Shoals Marine Laboratory in Maine and accessibly narrated, the core 38-minute presentation is divided into self-contained chapters entitled "Territoriality and Aggression," "Courtship and Breeding," and "Parental Care." Additional content on the DVD includes a licensed high-quality copy of the original 1968 Tinbergen film, soundscapes from the breeding colony, and a short commentary by Dr. Thomas D. Seeley (Cornell University) describing the significance of Tinbergen's pioneering work on gull communication.
