PBF Energy (“PBF”) is one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and suppliers of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil, petrochemical feedstocks, lubricants and other petroleum products in the United States. PBF currently owns and operates five domestic oil refineries and related assets with a combined processing capacity, known as throughput, of approximately 900,000 bpd, and a weighted average Nelson Complexity Index of 12.2.
PBF Energy’s refineries are located in California, Delaware, Louisiana, New Jersey and Ohio. Our newest refinery is located in Torrance, California processes a blend of primarily heavy and medium crudes to produce a high-value product slate.  The Torrance refinery has a nameplate crude capacity of 155,000 barrels per day and is PBF’s most complex refinery with a Nelson Complexity index of 14.9.  The Chalmette refinery was acquired by PBF Energy in 2015 and is located just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. Chalmette is a 189,000 barrel per day, dual-train coking refinery with a Nelson Complexity of 12.7 and is capable of processing both light and heavy crude oil. The facility is strategically positioned on the Gulf Coast with strong logistics connectivity that offers flexible raw material sourcing and product distribution opportunities, including the potential to export products.  Our East Coast refineries, at Delaware City and Paulsboro, have a combined refining capacity of 370,000 bpd and Nelson Complexity Indices of 11.3 and 13.2, respectively. These high-conversion refineries process primarily medium and heavy, sour crudes and have historically received the bulk of their feedstock via ships and barges on the Delaware River but have the capability to receive crude shipments via rail into crude rail unloading facilities at our Delaware City refinery.  Our Midcontinent refinery, at Toledo, processes light, sweet crude, has a throughput capacity of 170,000 bpd and a Nelson Complexity Index of 9.2. The majority of Toledo’s WTI-based crude is delivered via pipelines that originate in both Canada and the United States. Since our acquisition of Toledo in 2011, we have added additional truck and rail crude unloading capabilities that provide feedstock sourcing flexibility for the refinery and enables Toledo to run a more cost-advantaged crude slate.
PBF Energy also owns 49.5% of PBF Logistics LP (NYSE: PBFX). PBF Logistics LP, headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, is a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by PBF Energy to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products, terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets.

The notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by PBF Services Company LLC, PBF Investments LLC, Delaware City Refining Company LLC, PBF Power Marketing LLC, Paulsboro Refining Company LLC, Toledo Refining Company LLC, Chalmette Refining, L.L.C., Torrance Refining Company LLC, PBF Energy Western Region LLC and Torrance Logistics Company LLC . The notes and guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of the issuers’ and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, including PBF Holding’s asset based revolving credit agreement and the Issuers’ 7.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2023. The notes and the guarantees rank senior in right of payment to the issuers’ and the guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment thereto. The notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to any of the issuers’ and the guarantors’ existing or future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness and other obligations of the issuers’ non-guarantor subsidiaries. The notes pay interest semi-annually in cash in arrears on June 15 and December 15 each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2025. The indenture contains customary terms, events of default and covenants for an issuer of non-investment grade debt securities. These covenants include limitations on the Issuers’ and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock; make equity distributions, pay dividends on or repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments; enter into transactions with affiliates; create liens; engage in mergers and consolidations or otherwise sell all or substantially all of the issuers’ assets; designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; make certain investments; and limit the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to PBF Holding. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. Many of these covenants will cease to apply or will be modified if the Notes are rated investment grade. At any time prior to June 15, 2020, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes in an amount not greater than the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 107.250% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. On or after June 15, 2020, the Issuers may redeem all or part of the Notes, in each case at the redemption prices described in the Indenture, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In addition, prior to June 15, 2020, the Issuers may redeem all or part of the Notes at a “make-whole” redemption price described in the Indenture, together with any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Upon a change of control that results in a ratings decline, the Issuers will be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount of the Notes on the date of purchase plus accrued interest. Prior to a covenant termination event, certain asset dispositions will be triggering events that may require the Issuers to use the proceeds therefrom to offer to repurchase Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable repurchase date.

Value
 Is PBF Energy undervalued based on future cash flows and its price relative to the stock market?

Value is all about what a company is worth versus what price it is available for. If you went into a grocery store and all the bananas were on sale at half price, they could be considered undervalued.



INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS 


Here we compare the current
share price of PBF Energy to its discounted cash flow value.
The discounted cash flow value is simply looking at what the company is worth today, based on estimates of how much money it is expected to make in the future.



 How is this discounted cash flow calculated?
 The current share price of PBF Energy is above its future cash flow value. 
Often investors are willing to pay a premium for a company that has a high dividend or the potential for future growth.



PRICE RELATIVE TO MARKET 


We can also value a company based on what the stock market is willing to pay for it. This is similar to the price of fruit (e.g. Mangoes or Avacados) increasing when they are out of season, or how much your home is worth.
The amount the stock market is willing to pay for PBF Energy's earnings, growth and assets is considered below, and whether this is a fair price.




Price based on past earnings

Are PBF Energy's earnings available for a low price, and how does this compare to other companies in the same industry?


Good value based on earnings compared to the Energy industry average.

Good value based on earnings compared to the overall market.




Price based on expected Growth
Does PBF Energy's expected growth come at a high price?


Good value based on expected growth next year.




Price based on value of assets
What value do investors place on PBF Energy's assets?

Value checks
We assess PBF Energy's value by looking at:

Is the discounted cash flow value less than 20%, or 40% of the share price? (2 checks) (Click here or on bar chart for details of DCF calculation.)
Is the PE ratio less than the market average, and/ or less than the Energy industry average (and greater than 0)? (2 checks)
Is the PEG ratio within a reasonable range (0 to 1)? (1 check)
Is the PB ratio less than the Energy industry average (and greater than 0)? (1 check)
PBF Energy has a total score of 4/6, see the detailed checks below.
Note: We use GAAP Earnings per Share in all our calculations including PE and PEG Ratio.
Note 2: PEG ratio is based on analysts EPS growth expectations in 1 year (13.21%).

Discounted cash flow (Free cash flow to Equity)

Current discount (share price of $22.25): -43%

Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 12.52% = 2.33% + (1.328 * 7.67%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered Beta is the Unlevered Beta adjusted for financial leverage. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Levered Beta = Unlevered beta (1 + (1- tax rate) (Debt/Equity))
1.328 = 0.827 (1 + (1- 30%) (86.54%))
Levered Beta used in calculation = 1.328

Assumptions

The risk free rate of 2.33% is from the 10 year government bond rate in US.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet).
The dividend discount model is automatically used for companies in the following industries: Banks, Insurance, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.

PBF Energy inks deal for California refinery, logistics assets








HOUSTON, Oct. 1


10/01/2015


By
Robert Brelsford

OGJ Downstream Technology Editor






































PBF Holding Co. LLC, a subsidiary of PBF Energy Inc., Parsippany, NJ, has entered an agreement to buy ExxonMobil Corp.’s 155,000-b/d refinery in Torrance, Calif., which has been shuttered since early this year following an explosion and ensuing fire that struck the plant in February (OGJ Online, Feb. 19, 2015).
The deal—which includes the refinery as well as ExxonMobil’s related California product terminals, crude and product pipelines, and other logistics assets—amounts to $537.5 million, plus working capital that will be valued at closing, PBF Energy said.
To be financed with a combination of cash, debt, and equity, PBF Energy’s purchase of the California operations comes as part of the company’s continued growth strategy to expand both its refining and logistics holdings across the US, said PBF Chief Executive Officer Tom Nimbley.
The company, which currently operates a 190,000-b/d refinery in Delaware City, Del.; a 180,000-b/d refinery in Paulsboro, NJ; and a 170,000-b/d refinery in Toledo, Ohio, also recently announced its entry into a $322-million deal with ExxonMobil and Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) for the purchase of Chalmette Refining LLC, an ExxonMobil-PDVSA joint venture that operates a 189,000-b/d refinery in Louisiana, as well as related logistic assets along the US Gulf Coast (OGJ Online, June 18, 2015).
The related Torrance assets will be held by PBF Energy Western Region LLC, a newly created and wholly owned subsidiary established to support the company’s expansion into the US West Coast, PBF Energy said.
Pending regulatory approvals and restoration of the refinery to full-working order following damages from the February fire, the Torrance transaction is scheduled to close during second-quarter 2016, according to PBF.
ExxonMobil said it expects to hand over control of the refinery and related logistics assets to PBF Energy by mid-2016.
Once completed, the Torrance acquisition will boost PBF Energy’s total refining capacity by more than 60% to about 900,000 b/d.
Logistics assets
In addition to the high-conversion refinery, which can process heavy, high-TAN, and high-sulfur crudes, PBF Energy will acquire the following as part of the Torrance transaction.
Crude gathering, logistics:
• M-1, M-55, and M-70 pipelines. These pipelines provide the refinery direct connection to heavy San Joaquin Valley crude oil, the primary feedstock processed at Torrance. PBF’s acquisition of the lines includes six associated pump stations.
• M-131, M-134, M-137, and M-146 pipelines. These pipelines link the refinery to additional domestic sources of crude oils, including production from Aera Energy Inc.’s Ventura County, Calif., operations, as well as to imported waterborne varieties.
Bulk gasoline-lubricants storage, distribution:
• Refined product terminals in Vernon, Calif., and Atwood, Calif.
• Lubricants distribution center in Vernon.
Refined product logistics:
• M-141, M-145, M-3, L-42, M-119, and L-43 pipelines. These pipelines connect the refinery to production distribution outlets that include Long Beach Harbor, the Port of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles international airport, as well as to terminals at Vernon, Atwood, and the Port of Los Angeles’ Southwest Terminal Area No. 1.
The transaction also includes shell capacity of 8.6 million bbl in on site crude, intermediate, and finished product storage at the refinery.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
