FAQ 

Kiio Mobile
Which devices does Kiio Support?
Kiio runs on Apple devices (versions 9.x, 10.x), as well as Android devices (version 4.1.1 to 6.0.x).

I need Kiio Mobile. How do I get it?
Your provider will use your email address to register you on Kiio. Once registered, you’ll receive an email with instructions on how to install the app on your mobile device. Your content will then be available on Kiio.

I have Kiio on my mobile device. What is my username and password?
Your username is the email address you used to register. You created the password when you downloaded/installed Kiio onto your mobile device. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it.

I forgot my password. What do I do?
If you forget your password, please contact Kiio Customer Support for assistance.
Phone: 608.467.4602
Email: support@kiio.com

Will I be notified when there are updates made to my content?
When your provider updates your content, you will receive an email to alert you of the changes. In Kiio, an orange ‘Update’ flag will appear on the content thumbnail for any updated routines.

What do the options on the Settings screen do?

Keep me signed in

Once you have signed in to Kiio, you will stay signed in even if you restart your device and/or restart the app. This option saves time on personal devices by not requiring your username and password with each use, however Kiio recommends that this option be turned off on shared devices. By default, this setting is on.


Keep screen on during play

Once you have tapped Begin for a routine, the screen of your device will not go dark during the exercises. Be default, this setting is on.


Auto-advance exercises

Once you tap OK to close the Feedback window after completing an exercise, you will automatically be taken to the next exercise in your routine. By default, this setting is on.


Flick to scroll through routine

Once you are viewing content in the player, you can navigate from one exercise to another by flicking up or down. By default, this setting is on.


Only transfer on Wi-Fi

Your device will only allow data to be transmitted when connected via Wi-Fi, which ensures that Kiio does not use personal data but may also cause a delay in the transfer of routine data to your provider. By default, this setting is off.


Measurement Units

For exercises involving resistance bands, force targets are shown in the exercise details with units of pounds (lbs). This option allows you to change it to kilograms.


View License Agreement

When you first launched Kiio, a License Agreement was presented. This button allows you to review this License Agreement at any time.



How do I change/set my profile picture?
On the Profile screen, tap Edit (underneath the image circle). Select whether you would like to take a new photo or apply an existing picture as your profile image. Simply choose the desired image to see it applied.

What happens if I don’t review/complete all of the assigned content?
Your provider is able to review usage of Kiio and use this information to provide updates as required. To know more about how your provider will leverage Kiio usage data, contact them directly to discuss.

What information does my provider see?
Your provider is able to see how often and for how long you log into and use Kiio. Additionally, your provider can view any feedback you provide, if applicable.

Kiio FLEX
I forgot my username. What do I do?
To reset or be reminded of your username, follow the steps in this Quick Reference Guide for detailed instructions.

I forgot my password. How do I reset it?
To reset your password, follow the steps in this Quick Reference Guide for detailed instructions.

How do I save?
When you create a new patient, therapist, or exercise template, you will need to click SAVE in the bottom right-hand corner. After that, kiio FLEX automatically saves any changes made to templates, patient information, or your therapist account.

How do I add a patient to the Quick Pick list?
To add a patient to the Quick Pick list, click on the patient’s name and click Add to Quick Pick in the patient preview window. You can also drag the name into the list.

Can I assign more than one routine to a patient?
Yes. Once the first routine has been assigned, you can assign additional routines from the template library by dragging and dropping the desired routines onto the patient’s clipboard. Alternately you can create a new, blank routine for a patient by clicking the Add New button and selecting to assign your new routine to the patient. From there, you can add any exercises desired.
TIP: To select which routine is active, use the dropdown list located at the top of the routine clipboard.

Can I close my Quick Pick list without clicking the “x”?
Yes. To simultaneously activate a patient and close the Quick Pick list, double-click on the name of the patient in the Quick Pick list.

Can I close the exercise or routine previews?
These previews will close if you click the Next Page arrow in your routine/exercise library. However, the previews are meant to be a quick tool, so there is no direct way to “close” these windows. Let us know if this option is something you desire.

Can I drag more than one exercise at a time into a routine?
You can drag more than one from the Routine Preview window. Use CTRL+Click to select the multiple exercises you want (you can also use SHIFT+Click to select a range). Then, simply drag the selected exercises to the open routine workspace. You cannot select more than one exercise from the Exercise Template list. If this is a feature you desire, please let us know!

Can I select more than one exercise at a time on a routine template or on my patient’s clipboard?
You cannot select more than one exercise at a time on an opened routine template or in a patient’s clipboard, although you can select multiple exercises on a routine preview using CTRL+Click. If this is feature you desire, please let us know!

 
Searching
Why is my patient list empty?
With HIPAA in mind, the Patient List only shows names you specifically search for. By default, you will only see your currently active patient in the list until you start a search. You can easily view all of your patients by selecting your name from the Search’s “Assign Therapist” dropdown list.

How do I find all of my patients?
To find all your patients, choose your name from the Assigned Therapist dropdown menu found in the patient search window (Users – Patient tab).
How can I find all of the exercise templates I’ve made?
In the Search – Advanced Options window in the Library tab, choose to Filter by Author and then select only the “Mine” checkbox. This will show all your templates in both the routine and exercise library lists.
How can I find exercises more easily?
We’ve written a Quick Reference Guide to help with searching. It covers topics such as tricks & tips for text searching as well as how to use the Advanced Options for searching by muscle, joint, cable use, author, and more.
The exercise I’m looking for isn’t in the kiio FLEX Library. What do I do?
You have some options:

If the exercise you want is somewhat similar to one already in the Library, you can modify the existing template.
If it is not at all similar to any exercises in the Library, you can create your own exercise template.
You can contact Kiio Inc. and make a content request at using the Content Request Form.

When I search for routines, why am I getting more search results than I expected?
When you type something into the Search window, it not only looks at the Routine Names themselves, but ALSO the exercises contained within the routines.
I accidentally deleted a patient. Is there any way to get them back?
Yes. Use the “Include deleted patients” checkbox in the Patient Search – Advanced Options and then search for the patient by name. By using this option, the patient list will include deleted patients, which will be marked by an (Archived) next to their name. Click on their name and then click the “Restore” button in the patient preview window or simply double-click the name in the Patient List to activate.
kiio FLEX Library & Customization
Can I add my own content to the kiio FLEX Library?
Yes, you can create new exercise templates by clicking the +New button on the Library – Exercises tab. In your new exercise, you can import pictures and/or videos for your exercise by clicking Import Media.
You also can edit any pre-made template in kiio FLEX by first creating a copy (simply double-click on the template name) and then editing the details as you desire. Every template in the kiio FLEX Library is customizable yielding millions of possibilities.
Is there a limit to how many exercise templates I can have?
The software does not impose a limit on exercise template count (nor routine templates). We have tested with thousands of templates.
Can I change the wording used in an exercise template?
Yes. You can make a copy of any Kiio master exercise templates by double-clicking on the template name. From there you can modify them as you wish, including any wording used in the notes or reminders.
What are the checkboxes next to the exercise’s picture on the patient’s clipboard used for?
These boxes can be used to disable an exercise without deleting it from the routine. By default, printouts will only show enabled (checked) exercises, which makes the option to disable ideal for progression-based therapy.
Can I enter ranges for Reps, Sets and Intervals?
Yes. Simply place a dash after the first number, then enter the upper range number. For example, you can enter 5 sets of 12-15 reps. Either or both can be ranges.
Example: 3-4 sets of 45-60 second intervals.
What kinds of media files are able to be imported for my exercises?
We support importing one or more image files (bmp, jpg, gif, png), as well as movie clips (mov, avi, mp4, mpeg4, wmv, m4v).
I took a video with my phone and it is appearing sideways in kiio FLEX. Can I rotate it?
Yes. In the Import Video window, click the Rotate Video button prior to importing the video.
If the exercise image is out-of-sync with the left/right designation, how can I fix it?
If the left/right side designation is out of sync with your exercise’s image, leave the image as is and instead choose the correct side designation from the pop-up list in the upper right corner of the exercise details.
NOTE: Use the side designation rather than the Flip Image icon because clicking on the Flip Image icon will ALSO automatically flip the left/right designation.
Why does my imported video of someone walking show them going both forwards and backwards?
This may be happening because the “Ping-Pong” playback option is selected for this exercise, which will make exercise media play forward and then backward repeatedly.
To fix this, select the Loop playback option in the Form/Effort tab of the exercise’s editing window (located above the exercise image).
I created an exercise template to be left-sided but now I want to use it as a right-sided exercise. What do I do?
To make an exercise match the patient’s desired side (L/R), open the Exercise Template Editing Window and flip the media, if necessary, to show the correct side in use.
TIP: For exercise templates, using the “?” selection for single-sided exercises allows you to choose an applicable side as the exercise is assigned to a patient.
How can I make an exercise with movement into an Isometric exercise?
You can transform any exercise into an isometric exercise by sliding the range of motion markers to meet at the position you would like to show. This turns animated content into a single image, and can be done to show any position within the animation.
I created a new exercise for my patient and I want to be able to use it in the future with other patients. How do I add it to my exercise library?
If you want to save an exercise on a patient’s clipboard back to your exercise library, simply drag and drop the exercise into your list of Exercise Templates.
Can I make a copy of one of my routine templates?
Yes. Open your routine template for editing (spiral notepad view), and then choose “Save As” from the kiio FLEX main menu. This will save a copy of the routine back to your library.
Will Kiio create custom animations for me and my clinic?
You can request new exercises to be animated using the Content Request Form*.
Email your completed Content Request Form to: content@kiio.com. The content team will review your request and respond with a quote and time estimate.
*All content requests must include a video/image attached to the request to be considered.
I’m importing a high-speed video, but only some of the frames are transferring. Do you support higher frame rates?
Yes. In the Import Video window, expand the Advanced Options. By default kiio FLEX imports 29.97 FPS and ½ of the frames. Select from the dropdown controls to select more frames and/or different frame rates.
I have a PAL camera. Do you support 25 FPS?
Yes. In the Import Video window, expand the Advanced Options. Select 25 frames/sec from the dropdown control.
Collaboration & Share (Import/Export)
How can I share/transfer my patients with other therapists?
If you are on the same laptop but using different kiio FLEX login accounts, simply search for the patient by name and then double-click to edit.
NOTE: If the patient does not appear in your list, have your kiio FLEX administrator log in, go to Settings -> Admin, and select the checkbox to Permit any Therapist to Search ALL Patient Names.
Network-based sharing will also be available in our Enterprise solution later this year. For local-PC-based installations using multiple laptops, see the Quick Reference Guide covering How to Share/Transfer a Patient.
How do I share my custom created Exercise Templates with other therapists?
If you are on the same laptop but using different kiio FLEX login accounts, simply check the Shared box for either the routine or individual exercise template(s). A shared symbol appears by the template name in the Template List. This feature will also be available in our Enterprise solution later this year for networked-based sharing. For local-PC-based installations, see the Quick Reference Guide covering how to Export/Import Library Templates.
How do I change what information is exported to an electronic medical record like Epic or Cerner?
Go to the Settings-PC tab. From here, you can choose the details in a routine or exercise that will be exported to your electronic health record.
Setup & Update
What kind of computer do I need to run kiio FLEX?
kiio FLEX is compatible with the following operating systems:
32-bit, Windows 7: Home, Professional, Ultimate
32-bit, Windows 8.1: Pro, Enterprise
64-bit, Windows 7: Professional, Ultimate
64-bit, Windows 8.1: Pro, Enterprise
Minimum Screen Resolution: 1366×768
Minimum RAM: 4 GB
i5 or better processor recommended
How do I get software updates?
There are two ways:
(1) Login to kiio FLEX and click Menu > Updates. A dialogue box will inform you as to whether or not you are using the most updated version of the software. If you are not, click Download, and save the update to your computer. Navigate to where you saved the update, and run the file FLEX Update.exe.
(2) Alternatively, you can check for updates on our software downloads page. The newest version of the software will be at the top of the list.
How do I log in to the kiio website?
In order to log in to the kiio website, you need to create a website account, which is separate from your kiio FLEX login information. To create a website account, click Login in the upper right then click Register.
I know that I have a kiio website account, but I can’t remember my password. What should I do?
To reset your website password, follow the instructions in this Quick Reference Guide.
I forgot my kiio FLEX password, and now it says I’m locked out after 5 login attempts. How do I reset my password?
Log into kiio FLEX as administrator and go to the Users-Therapist tab. Your name appears with “locked-out” after it. Edit the account and enter in a new password.
I’m adding a patient. Do I need to include their email and other information?
No. All you need to enter is the Patient’s first and last name. All other fields are optional. The system auto-fills in a unique entry into the email field for you so you don’t have to come up with something on your own. However, it is a good idea to get your patient’s email if you want to make use of emailing them their home exercise program handouts (as well as in preparation for kiio Mobile).
Can I change the information on my home exercise program printout headers, such as the logo, email, phone number and other contact information?
Yes. To change the logo, go to the Settings-Site tab and click the Browse button next to the Site Logo icon. Select an image file (bmp, gif, jpg, png). Here you can also change the Site Name and Site Description text used in the headers as well. To change other parts of the header, go to the Settings-PC tab and make adjustments in the Library Report Options section.
I don’t want my email shown on the printout headers. Is that possible?
Yes. Go to the Settings-PC tab and uncheck the “Therapist Email” box.
It looks like some words are cut off and I can’t see everything (e.g., in the exercise editing window). Why is this happening?
There are a few possible reasons you can’t see all of the kiio FLEX window. Please see the Quick Reference Guide covering How to Fix Screen-Viewing Issues in kiio FLEX to find the solution to your particular problem.
Why is my taskbar blocking my view of kiio FLEX?
kiio FLEX is designed to use all of the computer screen. If the taskbar on the computer you are using is not set to hide when it is not in use, then it could block your view. Please see the Quick Reference Guide covering How to Fix Screen-Viewing Issues in kiio FLEX to learn how to optimize your view.
Does kiio FLEX come in other languages, like Spanish?
While kiio FLEX currently comes in English, we are working on our Enterprise solution which will be translated into multiple languages, including Spanish. In the meantime, you can enter any typed text, such as patient Notes or Reminders, in any language desired.
We have two therapists using the same laptop. Can we each have our own login?
Yes. New Therapist accounts must be created using the kiio FLEX administrator account. Once created, therapists can share their Exercise and Routine templates via the “Share” checkboxes. Also, there’s an option to keep patients separate, or viewable by all therapists.
Can I change the avatar used in the animations templates?
While not officially released yet, Kiio is creating a female avatar. When released, you will be able to switch between the male and female avatar as desired.
What platforms does kiio Mobile support?
While not officially released yet, our kiio Mobile solution will support Apple iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile platforms.
I have an older computer, will kiio FLEX work on it?
Before installing kiio FLEX, check to assure compatibility with your system. We support the following operating systems:
32-bit, Windows 7: Home, Professional, Ultimate
32-bit, Windows 8.1: Pro, Enterprise
64-bit, Windows 7: Professional, Ultimate
64-bit, Windows 8.1: Pro, Enterprise
Minimum Screen Resolution: 1366×768
Minimum RAM: 4 GB

The software does not impose a limit on Patient count. We have tested with thousands of names.
