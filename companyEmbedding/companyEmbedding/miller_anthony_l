Description
What We Like About This Mantel Clock Finished in Oak Yorkshire on select hardwoods and veneers this Howard Miller tambour mantel clock is rich in details. A beaded dentil molding surrounds the base and accents the carved side scrolls and burl-veneered front panel. Beneath a convex glass crystal, the aged dial offers black Arabic numerals and black serpentine hour and minute hands. Quartz, dual chime movement plays your choice of Westminster or Ave Maria chimes quarterly or hourly, and features volume control and automatic nighttime chime shut-off. (Batteries not included)
