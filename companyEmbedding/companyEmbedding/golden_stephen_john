Stephen John Cummings
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Colorado:













Does Stephen John Cummings carry a valid contracting license?



General construction contractors in Colorado are not licensed by the state. You should check for license requirements at the local level. Electrical and plumbing contractors require a license to work in the state.
Stephen John Cummings currently holds license Arc-400901 (Architect), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Colorado?



Colorado does not require contractors to take an exam or prove work experience, we advise homeowners to ask for multiple references when vetting a contractor to perform work on their homes.











Your liability risk when hiring Stephen John Cummings



Colorado does not require contractors to carry general liability insurance, but it is always a good idea to hire contractors who are covered by an active policy. Ask your contractor for copies of their policy before work starts.











Financial recourse when hiring Stephen John Cummings



A bond is not required in Colorado, consumers can file complaints with the Colorado Attorney General's Department of Consumer Protection.











What else should I know before hiring Stephen John Cummings



Colorado does not run a financial or criminal background check on contractors prior to licensing so there is more responsibility on the consumer to make the right choice. Some consumers run their own background check on the Colorado Bureau of Investigation site before hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Colorado,be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
