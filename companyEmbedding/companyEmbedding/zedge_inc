(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the associated notes thereto of this Quarterly Report, and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (or SEC).  As used below, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "the Company," "Zedge," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Zedge, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries, Zedge Europe AS and Zedge Canada, Inc., collectively.  Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements that contain the words "believes," "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "intends," and similar words and phrases. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results projected in any forward-looking statement. In addition to the factors specifically noted in the forward-looking statements, other important factors, risks and uncertainties that could result in those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A to Part I "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report and we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Investors should consult all of the information set forth in this report and the other information set forth from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016.  Overview  We provide one of the most popular content platforms, worldwide, centered on self-expression, attracting both creators looking to promote their content and consumers who utilize such content to express their identity, feelings, tastes and interests. Today our platform enables consumers to personalize their mobile devices with free, high-quality ringtones, wallpapers, home screen app icons, widgets and notification sounds. Our smartphone app, available in Google Play and iTunes app stores, has been installed over 260 million times, has more than 31 million monthly active users and has averaged among the top 25 free applications in the Google Play store in the U.S. for the past seven years and in the top 15 most popular free apps in the iTunes Entertainment category. To date, we have grown our user base without material investment in marketing, user acquisition or advertising.  We generate over 90% of our revenues from selling our advertising inventory to advertising networks/exchanges, real time bidding platforms, and game publishers. Advertising networks/exchanges are technology platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of media advertising inventory from multiple ad networks. Advertisers are attracted to us because of our sizable user base and our focus on mobile phone personalization. The remainder of our revenue is primarily generated from managing and optimizing advertising inventory for a third-party app publisher, as well as revenue billing, collection and reporting with respect to the advertising.  A key element in maintaining our position is our ability to meet user's expectations, which necessitates retaining employees with solid educational and professional credentials who are passionate about our mission to serve as a medium for self-expression.  Our ability to continue attracting advertisers depends on the growth and demographics of our user base, increased app usage and improved retention. These will require continued investment in product, technology and marketing. Our growth plan also relies on improved monetization techniques and selective strategic investments and acquisitions.  We believe that our business model is scalable and allows for significant portions of revenue growth to flow to our bottom line.  We were formerly a majority-owned subsidiary of IDT Corporation, or IDT. On June 1, 2016, IDT's interest in Zedge was spun-off by IDT to IDT's stockholders and we became an independent public company through a pro rata distribution of our common stock held by IDT to IDT's stockholders (the Spin-Off).  Critical Accounting Policies  Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of management's most subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Our critical accounting policies include those related to capitalized software and technology development costs, revenue recognition and goodwill. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For additional discussion of our critical accounting policies, see our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  In May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, to provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. Pursuant to this ASU, an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all the following are met: (1) the fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement method is used) of the modified award is the same as the fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement method is used) of the original award immediately before the original award is modified (if the modification does not affect any of the inputs to the valuation technique that the entity uses to value the award, the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification); (2) the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified; and (3) the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. We will adopt the amendments in this ASU prospectively to an award modified on or after on August 1, 2018. We are evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  In January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. Under the current guidance, there are three elements of a business-inputs, processes, and outputs. While an integrated set of assets and activities (collectively referred to as a "set") that is a business usually has outputs, outputs are not required to be present. In addition, all the inputs and processes that a seller uses in operating a set are not required if market participants can acquire the set and continue to produce outputs, for example, by integrating the acquired set with their own inputs and processes. The amendments in this ASU provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. If the screen is not met, the amendments in this ASU (1) require that to be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and (2) remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements. The amendments provide a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present. The framework includes two sets of criteria to consider that depend on whether a set has outputs. Although outputs are not required for a set to be a business, outputs generally are a key element of a business; therefore, the FASB has developed more stringent criteria for sets without outputs. Lastly, the ASU narrows the definition of the term output. We will adopt the amendments in this ASU on August 1, 2018. We are evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  In January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU that simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this ASU, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. Early adoption of this standard is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We intend to adopt this standard for its goodwill impairment test to be performed in fiscal 2017.  In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For receivables, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a new forward-looking "expected loss" model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to current practice, except the losses will be recognized as allowances instead of reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. In addition, an entity will have to disclose significantly more information about allowances, credit quality indicators and past due securities. The new provisions will be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. We will adopt the new standard on August 1, 2020. We are evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments. The new standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. We will adopt the new standard on August 1, 2017. We do not expect that the adoption of the new standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU related to the accounting for leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use, or ROU, model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. We will adopt the new standard on August 1, 2019. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede most of the current revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS. The goals of the revenue recognition project were to clarify and converge the revenue recognition principles under U.S. GAAP and IFRS and to develop guidance that would streamline and enhance revenue recognition requirements. To accomplish this objective, the standard requires five basic steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We are required to adopt this standard on August 1, 2018. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the standard. We are evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet selected an adoption date or a transition method. We cannot reasonably estimate the impact that the adoption of the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  Results of Operations Three and Nine Months Ended April 30, 2017 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended April 30, 2016 Three months ended Nine months ended April 30, Change April 30, Change 2017 2016 $ % 2017 2016 $ % (in thousands) Revenues $ 2,530 $ 2,573 $ (43 ) (1.7 )% $ 7,485 $ 8,661 $ (1,176 ) (13.6 )% Direct cost of revenues 406 327 79 24.2 1,186 932 254 27.3 Selling, general and administrative 2,151 1,850 301 16.3 6,222 5,316 906 17.0 Depreciation and amortization 166 153 13 8.5 487 470 17 3.6 Write-off of capitalized software and technology development costs. - - - - 9 - 9 nm (Loss) income from operations (193 ) 243 (436 ) (179.4 ) (419 ) 1,943 (2,362 ) (121.6 ) Interest and other income (expense) 6 (1 ) 7 700.0 14 2 12 600.0 Net (loss) gain resulting from foreign exchange transactions (52 ) 130 (182 ) (140.0 ) (19 ) (31 ) 12 38.7 (Provision for) benefit from income taxes - (46 ) 46 100.0 21 (152 ) 173 113.8 Net (loss) income $ (239 ) $ 326 $ (565 ) (173.3 )% $ (403 ) $ 1,762 $ (2,165 ) (122.9 )%  nm-not meaningful  Revenues. Revenues decreased slightly in the three months ended April 30, 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 due to a combination of factors including the continued negative impact from having been removed from the iTunes store in early 2016; our decision to reduce our investments in our Game Channel in mid-April 2016, which resulted in a decline in game installs for which we are paid on a "cost per install" basis; a decrease in revenue from advertising inventory offered on both our desktop and mobile websites; and a drop in revenue from our managing and optimizing advertising inventory for a third-party app publisher. Yet, aggregate revenue from our native Android and iOS apps increased even though MAU in the well-developed markets declined by approximately 11%. Our average revenue per monthly active user derived from our apps, or ARPMAU, increased 0.8% to $0.0249 from $0.0247 in the three months ended April 30, 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016. This increase resulted primarily from the introduction of a new Android ad unit in March 2017 which replaced a less valuable one and the addition of new and direct advertising relationships with demand partners interested in our inventory. Revenues decreased in the nine months ended April 30, 2017 compared to the same period in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a 13.4% decline in our app ARPMAU to $0.0240 from $0.0277. The app ARPMAU decrease was primarily due to our app being temporarily removed from the iTunes Store on February 1, 2016, which lowered the revenue per user that we were able to generate; a decline in MAU across more developed markets where we are able to command higher advertising rates; as well as our decision to reduce our investments in our Game Channel in mid-April 2016, which resulted in a decline in game installs for which we are paid on a "cost per install" basis. Although we launched a wallpaper app in iTunes in March 2016 and a ringtones app in December 2016, we still have not recovered from the time when our app was unavailable on the iTunes Store.  Also, we experienced lower advertising eCPMs ("effective cost per thousand impressions") than expected when compared to last year due to what we believe to be a shift in advertising budgets allocating more spend for video and/or native ad units vs. static ad units like banners and interstitials. Due to user concerns and the current nature of our product, we have a limited inventory of higher value ad formats although we started addressing this by rolling out higher value native ad units that do not negatively impact on the user experience. Monthly Active Users, or MAU, during the last 30 days of the quarter, increased by 0.3% to 31.7 million at April 30, 2017 from 31.6 million at April 30, 2016 driven by growth in the emerging markets offsetting declines in the well developed markets. We have several initiatives underway focused on content discovery and freshness which we believe will improve user growth, engagement and retention. In addition, we are releasing new features and investing in product marketing across both the Android and iOS apps in order to reverse the MAU downturn we experienced on a year-over-year basis in the well developed markets. MAU is a performance indicator that captures the number of unique users that opened our app in the previous 30-day period. Our install count, that is the number of times the Zedge app has been installed on devices, increased to 260.4 million at April 30, 2017 from 202.6 million a year ago.  Zedge introduced a standalone wallpaper app in iTunes in March 2016 and a standalone ringtone app in iTunes in December 2016. The rollout of these individual apps was done in order to both fully comply with iTunes terms and conditions as well as mitigate risk considering that iTunes removed our bundled ringtone and wallpaper app on February 1, 2016 leaving us with no market offering for many months. In mid-December 2016, we launched a new ad strategy with our Wallpaper and Ringtones apps, intended to improve user engagement. Even with the introduction of these two apps we still haven't recovered from being removed from the iTunes store in February 2016.  Direct cost of revenues. The increase in direct cost of revenues in the three and nine months ended April 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016 was attributable to the fees that we pay to third parties that provide us with internet hosting, content serving and filtering and marketing automation services. The costs associated with content serving and filtering and push notification marketing increased as a result of a new product offering from one of our vendors and because of expanding the addressable customer base that benefits from marketing automation services, respectively.  Selling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense consists mainly of payroll, benefits, facilities, marketing, content acquisition and consulting and professional fees. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense in the three and nine months ended April 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016 was mostly due to increases in payroll and benefits, accounting, tax, legal fees, rent, and noncash compensation. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in benefits expense in the nine months ended April 30, 2017 due to the recording of a $0.2 million receivable from Norway's SkatteFUNN government program designed to encourage research and development in Norwegian trade and industry, which related to previous periods. In addition, our headcount increased from 55 employees at April 30, 2016 to 64 employees at April 30, 2017.  Selling, general and administrative expense included stock-based compensation expense of $66,000 and $1,600 in the three months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $209,000 and $10,700 in the nine months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At April 30, 2017, unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation was an aggregate of $645,000. The unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period of the relevant grant that ends in 2020. In September 2016, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved an equity grant of options to purchase 231,327 shares of our Class B common stock to our executive officers, a consultant and a non-executive employee. The options vest over a three-year period. Unrecognized compensation expense related to this grant was an aggregate of $681,000 based on the estimated fair value of the options on the grant date. The unrecognized compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  While many of the costs of being a public company were already borne by us either directly or by allocation of corporate overhead from IDT, those expenses were allocated among all of IDT's operations, and we need to have the proper infrastructure in place to perform the necessary, legal, treasury, accounting, internal audit and reporting functions. We anticipate our total costs will increase by $750,000 to $900,000 per year as a result of the Spin-Off. Several of the costs included in this estimated range are preliminary, subject to negotiation, and may vary from the estimates when finalized.  Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization consists mainly of amortization of capitalized software and technology development costs of our internal developers on various projects that we invested in specific to the various platforms on which we operate our service.  Write-off of capitalized software and technology development costs. In the nine months ended April 30, 2017, we decided not to launch a project that was in development. Since this abandoned project did not have any future benefit, we charged the capitalized software and technology development costs for the project to expense.  Net (loss) gain resulting from foreign exchange transactions. Net (loss) gain resulting from foreign exchange transactions are comprised of losses and gains generated from movements in Norwegian Krone, or NOK, relative to the U.S. Dollar, including gains or losses from our NOK hedging activities. In the three months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, we had losses of $92,000 and gains of $156,000, respectively, from NOK hedging activities, and in the nine months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, we had losses of $68,000 and $68,000, respectively, from NOK hedging activities.  (Provision for) benefit from income taxes. The decrease in the provision for income taxes in the three and nine months ended April 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016 was due to the jurisdiction in which income was earned in the three and nine months ended April 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2016 and our ability to use net operating losses in those jurisdictions.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  General  At April 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 million and working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of $5.3 million. We currently expect that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements during the twelve months ending April 30, 2018.
