Product Description
J. Skinner&#174; Autumn Pumpkin Spice Danish&#8482;. Modern artisan baking. Made with over 100 layers of authentic Danish. Our authentic country pumpkin Danish recipe. Limited edition seasonal pack. Everyone's "falling" for this sweetly captivating combination of delicious pumpkins, spices, cream cheese, and over 100 layers of authentic Danish dough. Tamper - evident safety seal package. At J. Skinner, we feel life should be full of delicious moments to remember. That's why each sweetly indulgent treat we make has over 100 moist, delicious layers of authentic Danish dough, and each one of our fillings and toppings is more mouthwatering than the last. No matter how your day is going, it's always a perfect time to reward yourself with skinner! Authentic Danish. Through our single-minded focus on quality and flavor, the J. Skinner modern artisan baking company name has become synonymous with authentic, deliciously indulgent European-style baked goods. We take no shortcuts with methods or ingredients. Every mouthwatering Danish we make begins with over 100 layers of authentic Danish dough and an overnight resting process... infinitely superior to the quick, "no-time" methods used by our competitors. Thank you for purchasing a J. Skinner bakery product.

About Us — J. Skinner Baking























































Take a bite of any J. Skinner Danish and you’ll immediately notice a world of difference. It’s a world populated by mouth-watering flavor, superb ingredients and traditional baking techniques. Unlike the products mass-produced by our competitors, each of our artisan-style danish is moist, exquisitely textured, and sublimely scrumptious. That’s because we know you can’t rush delicious. We put time, thought and care into every crumb.From start to finish, it takes 24-36 hours to make a J. Skinner Danish. Our artisan dough is folded again and again into over 100 thin layers before it rests for up to a day at 34°F, allowing the flavors to blend and the yeast to rise perfectly. After its day of rest, we add a generous amount of creamy fillings or REAL fruit toppings before baking it to a golden brown. Indulgent icing is added and then it’s off for packing and shipping to a store near you! Sound too good to be true? Check out these reviews below!  






“
                    That's the perfect way to describe it...AWESOME !! I'm a 74 yr old son of German immigrants who operated a corner-store bakery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I was raised on quality baked goods. My father never skimped, he insisted on using only quality ingredients. Since my childhood, I have always been on the alert to find bakery products that meet those same high standards. It has not been easy. Most are tasteless, cheaply made ...junk ! Having now had three of your "Awesome Almond Danish" rings, my quest has been fulfilled. They have that mouth-tasting feel that tells the consumer that he is enjoying something special.

I don't normally write to companies about their products, however as I mentioned, I've spent many decades looking for that special something. Thanks to you, I've realized that indeed, you can go home again. Thank you.
                  ”

“
                    Dear Amazing Bakers,
Thank you for the most astonishingly scrumptious cinnamon rolls on earth! I'm not kidding! I've seen them before and thought, oh, packaged rolls, yeah, right. But they looked so delicious and your heating directions and package notes seemed so clear and genuine. You do not disappoint! Those lovely rolls never made it to the oven or microwave; they're truly, honestly, genuinely, authentically THE BEST cinnamon rolls I've ever eaten. And trust me on this; I've sampled more than my share! So many layers of perfection! Thank you, thank you, thank you and please don't ever stop making or distributing this incredible treat. 
                  ”

“
                    I LOVE your product. After a long search to find a good cheese danish I found your product. It is carefully made, flaky, with real cheese and not too sweet or tart. You have named this product perfectly.
                  ”

“
                    Hello! I just wanted to let you all know that I recently "stumbled" upon your raspberry danish in the bakery section of my Acme, and I absolutely LOVE it! It beats any other store-bought danish by a mile, and is more affordable than its competitors! I can buy TWO at a time! Thanks for such a yummy product!
                  ”

James Skinner Baking

	An inside look at James Skinner Baking, a modern artisan bakery famous for its Danish.









                James Skinner Baking Company
              


	The Omaha, NE headquarters of the James Skinner Baking Company—founded in 1983—is located adjacent to its 130,000-sq.-ft. plant housing 3 production lines.







                James Skinner Baking Company
              


	Although Skinner Baking maintains a diversified bakery business, its core ethos stems from the notion of 100 layers. Every batch of dough that forms the basis of its core Danish products undergoes a process whereby it’s progressively folded upon itself and sheeted until it has achieved 100 layers.







                James Skinner Baking Company
              


	After the Skinner Baking Danish dough has achieved its 100 layers of lamination, it then rests for a full day to proof at a controlled 34°F, slowly building flavor. Only then is it ready to form into the dozens of sweet baked goods the company offers. This Old World approach toward dough is central to the “artisan” positioning of the finished products.







                James Skinner Baking Company
              


	Skinner Baking has made a name for itself in via its Gourmet Cinnamon Rolls, made with its 100-layer Danish, cinnamon and brown sugar, and then topped with an icing made with American Neufchâtel cream cheese.







                James Skinner Baking Company
              


	One of the Skinner Baking’s most-recent introductions is the J. Skinner Triple Flavor-fest Ring, a ring of pull-apart Danishes that feature cheese, raspberry and apple fillings. Products are shipped frozen, ready to thaw and display for sale in retail in-store bakeries.







                James Skinner Baking Company
              


	One current private-label project at Skinner Baking is based on the J. Skinner Triple Flavor-fest Ring, but on a larger scale. The ring includes a dozen cinnamon rolls with cheese, raspberry and apple fillings, arranged in a ring, then topped with a streusel crumble and drizzled with frosting.







                James Skinner Baking Company
              


	Some lines at James Skinner Baking have grown highly automated, including those used in the manufacture of these chocolate chip muffins.







                James Skinner Baking Company
              


	A pass through the metal detector at the end of the James Skinner Baking muffin line, after packaging, is obligatory. The line for these mini muffins also includes a new robotic arm that de-pans the muffins and drops them onto the conveyor for subsequent sorting and packaging.







                James Skinner Baking Company
              


	Skinner Baking has seen strong interest in its “Perfect for Two” line of J. Skinner products, including this Cinnamon Sonata, Danish dough swirled with cinnamon and brown sugar, then topped with pecans, raisins and caramel icing, packaged with a microwave-safe tray.







                James Skinner Baking
              


	Even as the branded side of Skinner Baking’s business has grown, co-manufacturing and private label remain part of the company’s strategy. And leadership from the company has indicated that it has eyes on expanding its business overseas.

	“One notable upside to strong volume growth and consistent SKU mix is the ability to invest in targeted automation,” said David Skinner, marketing manager for the bakery, during a visit with Snack Food & Wholesale Bakery. “We completed the largest automation project in company history in 2014, and we will continue to drive an aggressive automation plan through 2015. We have a strong continuous improvement team that, by structure, identifies and executes projects across the year, which allows us to offer a premium product in a very reasonable pricing structure.”

Early life[edit]
James Alan Skinner was born in Moline, Illinois, United States, the son of Leon Skinner, a bricklayer, who died in 2006, aged 84.[3]
Skinner grew up in Davenport, Iowa and graduated from West High School there in 1962.[3]
He went on to serve nearly 10 years in the United States Navy.
Career[edit]
McDonald's[edit]
Skinner began his career with McDonald's in 1971 as a restaurant manager trainee in Carpentersville, Illinois.[4] He never graduated from college, attending Roosevelt University in Chicago, before dropping out after his sophomore year.[5]
Prior to becoming CEO, Skinner was President and Chief Operating Officer of the McDonald's Restaurant Group with corporate management responsibility for Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA), and Latin America.[4] Prior to that, he was responsible for McDonald's Japan Limited,[4] their second-largest market.[4] Skinner held numerous positions in the U.S. Corporation, including Director of Field Operations, Market Manager, Regional Vice President and U.S. Senior Vice President and Zone Manager.[4]
Skinner was named CEO of McDonald's Corp in 2004 and refocused the company on customer strategies, business disciplines and close global alignment.[6] Jim Skinner was succeeded as Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for McDonald’s Corporation by Don Thompson on June 30, 2012. Vice Chairman was a position that he held before becoming CEO in November 2004.
His greatest accomplishment, the "Plan to Win" strategy, managed to flip the company by reversing its falling profits. This strategy focused on improving on locations that already existed instead of expanding and building more. They hoped to achieve “faster, friendlier service; tastier food; a more appealing ambiance; better value; and sharper marketing.” By shifting strategies, Skinner and his team were able to increase McDonald’s total sales, increasing from $50.1 billion in 2004 to $70.1 billion in 2008.[7]
Skinner retired as Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on June 30, 2012 after 41 years with McDonald's.[8] In 2012, he received total annual compensation of $27,741,408.[9]
Other[edit]
As of 2014, Skinner is a member of the board of directors of:[10]

Hewlett-Packard (2013-)
Illinois Tool Works (2005-)
McDonald's (2004-)
Walgreens (2005-) (Chairman)

He has been a member of John McCain 2008, McCain-Palin Victory 2008, National Republican Congressional Committee, Romney for President, and Romney Victory Inc.[10]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2009, Skinner was named CEO of the Year by Chief Executive magazine.[8][11]
Personal life[edit]
Skinner met his future wife in Chicago, and they married in 1969.[3]

Early life[edit]
James Alan Skinner was born in Moline, Illinois, United States, the son of Leon Skinner, a bricklayer, who died in 2006, aged 84.[3]
Skinner grew up in Davenport, Iowa and graduated from West High School there in 1962.[3]
He went on to serve nearly 10 years in the United States Navy.
Career[edit]
McDonald's[edit]
Skinner began his career with McDonald's in 1971 as a restaurant manager trainee in Carpentersville, Illinois.[4] He never graduated from college, attending Roosevelt University in Chicago, before dropping out after his sophomore year.[5]
Prior to becoming CEO, Skinner was President and Chief Operating Officer of the McDonald's Restaurant Group with corporate management responsibility for Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA), and Latin America.[4] Prior to that, he was responsible for McDonald's Japan Limited,[4] their second-largest market.[4] Skinner held numerous positions in the U.S. Corporation, including Director of Field Operations, Market Manager, Regional Vice President and U.S. Senior Vice President and Zone Manager.[4]
Skinner was named CEO of McDonald's Corp in 2004 and refocused the company on customer strategies, business disciplines and close global alignment.[6] Jim Skinner was succeeded as Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for McDonald’s Corporation by Don Thompson on June 30, 2012. Vice Chairman was a position that he held before becoming CEO in November 2004.
His greatest accomplishment, the "Plan to Win" strategy, managed to flip the company by reversing its falling profits. This strategy focused on improving on locations that already existed instead of expanding and building more. They hoped to achieve “faster, friendlier service; tastier food; a more appealing ambiance; better value; and sharper marketing.” By shifting strategies, Skinner and his team were able to increase McDonald’s total sales, increasing from $50.1 billion in 2004 to $70.1 billion in 2008.[7]
Skinner retired as Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on June 30, 2012 after 41 years with McDonald's.[8] In 2012, he received total annual compensation of $27,741,408.[9]
Other[edit]
As of 2014, Skinner is a member of the board of directors of:[10]

Hewlett-Packard (2013-)
Illinois Tool Works (2005-)
McDonald's (2004-)
Walgreens (2005-) (Chairman)

He has been a member of John McCain 2008, McCain-Palin Victory 2008, National Republican Congressional Committee, Romney for President, and Romney Victory Inc.[10]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2009, Skinner was named CEO of the Year by Chief Executive magazine.[8][11]
Personal life[edit]
Skinner met his future wife in Chicago, and they married in 1969.[3]

Early life[edit]
James Alan Skinner was born in Moline, Illinois, United States, the son of Leon Skinner, a bricklayer, who died in 2006, aged 84.[3]
Skinner grew up in Davenport, Iowa and graduated from West High School there in 1962.[3]
He went on to serve nearly 10 years in the United States Navy.
Career[edit]
McDonald's[edit]
Skinner began his career with McDonald's in 1971 as a restaurant manager trainee in Carpentersville, Illinois.[4] He never graduated from college, attending Roosevelt University in Chicago, before dropping out after his sophomore year.[5]
Prior to becoming CEO, Skinner was President and Chief Operating Officer of the McDonald's Restaurant Group with corporate management responsibility for Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA), and Latin America.[4] Prior to that, he was responsible for McDonald's Japan Limited,[4] their second-largest market.[4] Skinner held numerous positions in the U.S. Corporation, including Director of Field Operations, Market Manager, Regional Vice President and U.S. Senior Vice President and Zone Manager.[4]
Skinner was named CEO of McDonald's Corp in 2004 and refocused the company on customer strategies, business disciplines and close global alignment.[6] Jim Skinner was succeeded as Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for McDonald’s Corporation by Don Thompson on June 30, 2012. Vice Chairman was a position that he held before becoming CEO in November 2004.
His greatest accomplishment, the "Plan to Win" strategy, managed to flip the company by reversing its falling profits. This strategy focused on improving on locations that already existed instead of expanding and building more. They hoped to achieve “faster, friendlier service; tastier food; a more appealing ambiance; better value; and sharper marketing.” By shifting strategies, Skinner and his team were able to increase McDonald’s total sales, increasing from $50.1 billion in 2004 to $70.1 billion in 2008.[7]
Skinner retired as Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on June 30, 2012 after 41 years with McDonald's.[8] In 2012, he received total annual compensation of $27,741,408.[9]
Other[edit]
As of 2014, Skinner is a member of the board of directors of:[10]

Hewlett-Packard (2013-)
Illinois Tool Works (2005-)
McDonald's (2004-)
Walgreens (2005-) (Chairman)

He has been a member of John McCain 2008, McCain-Palin Victory 2008, National Republican Congressional Committee, Romney for President, and Romney Victory Inc.[10]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In 2009, Skinner was named CEO of the Year by Chief Executive magazine.[8][11]
Personal life[edit]
Skinner met his future wife in Chicago, and they married in 1969.[3]

	Although the James Skinner Baking Co., Omaha, NE, maintains a highly diversified bakery business, its core ethos stems from the elegant, deceptively simple notion of 100 layers. Every batch of dough that forms the basis of its core Danish products undergoes a process whereby it’s progressively folded upon itself and sheeted until it has achieved the mathematical certainty of at least 100 layers. It then rests for a full day to proof at a controlled 34° F, slowly building signature flavor all the while. Only then is it ready to form into the dozens of sweet baked goods bearing the J. Skinner name and offered through in-store bakeries from coast to coast.
