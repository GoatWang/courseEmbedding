Protecting Your Identity
SOL Capital Management wants to help educate you about the potential financial consequences of identity theft. As such threats have become more sophisticated, we would like to share (and have included links to) two very useful and important articles that were published by FINRA (The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority). These articles offer some tips on safeguarding your assets and address how you can help mitigate identity theft.
Keeping Your Account Secure: Tips for Protecting Your Financial Information
				  This article, published by FINRA and SIFMA (the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association), recommends valuable steps you can take to help secure your personal financial information and assist in protecting your identity.
Safeguarding Your Financial Information: An Identity Theft Prevention Checklist
				  This handy FINRA article offers an easy-to-follow checklist of ways to help safeguard your sensitive information.
While avoiding identity theft can never be guaranteed, please take the time to read these very practical publications and implement their helpful suggestions.

SOL Capital Management desea poner a su disposición información acerca de las potenciales consecuencias de un robo de identidad. Para ello, incluimos enlaces a dos importantes artículos publicados por la Autoridad Regulatoria de la Industria Financiera (FINRA --por sus siglas en inglés).
					Estos artículos ofrecen sugerencias para salvaguardar sus activos y explican qué medidas se pueden tomar para reducir la probabilidad de un robo de identidad.

What are analysts saying about Microsoft Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Microsoft Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Microsoft reported strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Both earnings and revenues increased on a year-over-year basis. The impressive results demonstrated that the company is benefiting from continuing enterprise strength, strong Office 365 and Windows 10 adoption and robust penetration of Azure. We also note that LinkedIn has improved the company's presence in the social media market, which improved top-line growth. Management expects expenses to increase in fiscal 2018 due to continuing investments. This will weigh on profitability in the near term. Nevertheless, we believe that the company's expanding product portfolio is a key catalyst in the long haul. However, intensifying competition in the cloud space and unfavorable foreign exchange are headwinds." (7/24/2017)
2. Pacific Crest analysts commented, "We are raising our FCF estimates slightly and raising our target to $78 from $70 as we roll forward to calendar 2018. Reiterate Overweight on MSFT. Microsoft cloud was surprisingly strong; growth accelerated to 52%. The commercial cloud annualized run-rate increased 52% y/y to $15.2 billion in the quarter, exceeding our estimate by nearly $1 billion. Azure grew 93% y/y, maintaining the robust growth seen last quarter despite a larger revenue base. Premium services, which more than 80% of Azure customers adopt, drove the top-line performance and a ~300 basis point uptick in the cloud margin to 51%. Surface shortfall should not distract from stellar cloud momentum. Ultimately, Microsoft’s next three to five years will mostly be driven by its success in commercial cloud, which now represents 16% of sales, up from 5% in early 2015. While management underestimated the impact of Surface end-of-life and competitive pricing discounting that resulted in a revenue miss, we think the strong and broad-based adoption of Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn cloud assets should trump any near-term concerns on Surface. Overweight MSFT on multiple upside levers; raising target to $78. We believe MSFT remains one of the marquee cloud stocks to own based on multiple upside levers to the model, including: (1) commercial cloud momentum across Azure, Azure Stack, Office 365, and Dynamics 365, (2) new product cycles, (3) Win10 commercial adoption, and (4) improving free cash flow margin." (4/28/2017)
3. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Microsoft's modus operandi is intact as it exceeded estimates established by its lowered guidance, only to report results that were about in line with previous consensus numbers. Also true to form, its guidance for next quarter was lower than consensus expectations adjusting for LinkedIn. Regardless, the results were stable with 1% revenue growth, though operating cash flow grew 12% with several asterisks." (1/27/2017)
4. BGC Financial analysts commented, "Share of Microsoft are trading near a lifetime high of $64.10 reached on 12/22/16 as the company prepares to report its December quarter results post-market on Thursday January 26th. Investors are warming up to the growth in the more valuable assets embedded inside Microsoft including its Intelligent Cloud segment that has a revenue run rate exceeding $13 billion, its data center footprint that spans 38 geographic regions, and a focus on layering artificial intelligence across its products. That said, these more desirable elements are still buried in a company that is producing low-single digit revenue growth and is underperforming in its consumer segments in our opinion. The December quarter result is particularly sensitive to consumer demand given the historical pattern of PCs and game consoles being a desired holiday gift." (1/25/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Sell Ratings, 8 Hold Ratings, 24 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.65)Consensus Price Target: $76.07 (3.35% upside)

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Stage Stores Credit Card


                                            I was charged fees then late fees then fees. So $28.22 balance appeared out of thin air without any purchase. I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

                                            Oh my goodness! He is awesome! After looking for a house and working with several different mortgage companies we were ready to give up.

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!
