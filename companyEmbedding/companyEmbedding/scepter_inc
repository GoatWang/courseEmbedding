Scepter Inc. Increases Production and Safety With Full-Scale High-Ambient Industrial Lighting System Renovation

				Posted about 2 months ago | 0 comment
 

			
							
				

											Jun 9, 2017				-
						(Newswire)

			
			
Scepter, Inc., the Southeast’s leading industrial ingot manufacturer and aluminum recycler, partnered with CandleRay Lighting Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to reduce their Waverly, Tennessee annual electricity consumption by about 150 kilowatts. In addition to the $95k in new annual energy savings, the TVA EnergyRight® Solutions for Business & Industry program and Meriwether Lewis Electric Cooperative (MLEC) helped to fund Scepter's energy measures with an incentive check for nearly $100,000. The completed project paid for itself within five (5) months.
“Increasing the light levels was a priority for our plant. We wanted to ensure employee safety and make their jobs easier. We also wanted to decrease the maintenance demand. We were spending too much time conducting repairs and replacing components on the old system,” explained Scepter's Plant Manager, Chris Nicholas.
CandleRay Lighting Company conducted detailed site surveys, energy analysis, lighting design and photometric plans, and equipment specifications for the demanding, high-ambient 480-volt industrial lighting system. Numerous on-site evaluations and employee interviews led to a detailed lighting plan with specific project goals, resulting in a highly successful project.
“This was a complex project that involved extreme conditions, significant safety concerns, and a tight schedule. We are very excited that Scepter will see a tremendous return on their investment and the employees will gain increased visibility and safety. Most importantly, Scepter significantly reduced their carbon footprint,” says Clay Wraith, CandleRay Lighting’s Chief Operations Officer.
Ultimately, if a large-scale lighting project is successful, it will have benefits that go beyond the facility. Modernizing Scepter’s lighting system resulted in a massive reduction in Scepter’s load demand from MLEC and the TVA. Customer satisfaction is at the center of CandleRay Lighting’s business philosophy, and CandleRay team members work in close collaboration with clients and energy partners to ensure the most advantageous plan for each project. 
About CandleRay Lighting Company 
CandleRay Lighting Company designs and implements advanced, energy-efficient lighting and control systems for a wide range of construction projects.  CandleRay’s unique model ensures the most inspiring visual environments for architectural, commercial, sport, and industrial applications. CandleRay is dedicated to integrity and customer satisfaction with a proven track record of successful, full-scale lighting projects. As a preferred partner for various energy and utility programs across the country, CandleRay Lighting is an advocate of effective design practice which yields the most savings and profit for the end-user.

Scepter's employees are continually trained in the latest production techniques



 
The Best People & The Best Technology
Scepter employs some of the industry's best talent.  While we are proud of our proprietary technology and innovation, our people's ability to leverage and use that technology allows us to achieve our industry-leading results.
 
Founding Information
"Scepter" refers to the "Scepter Group*," a collection of legally separate, independent companies affiliated through various relationships with Scepter, Inc., a privately held business corporation founded by Garney B. Scott, Jr. in 1986 and headquartered in Waverly, TN.
Today, the Scepter Group* is a recognized leader in aluminum dross and scrap recycling.  Scepter provides its customers with an unbeatable combination of on-spec chemistry, industry-best recovery and competitive pricing.  We have differentiated ourselves through an innovative approach to leveraging furnace technology and talented employees while, at the same time, maintaining a strong commitment to environmentally-friendly practices and a safe workplace.
In addition, Scepter's Commercial Manager (who works out of the Waverly HQ) is supported by a Commercial Assistant in each plant.  This allows us to give each customer corporate oversight as well as a local contact.
Scepter's plants are located in geographically advantageous locations to serve our customers, who are large, medium and small aluminum producers and processors.  We forge long-term relationships with our customers who regularly turn to us for their processing needs.
Scepter's employees are important.  In fact, "People-Safety-Housekeeping" holds the #1 spot on our priority list.  We provide competitive wages and benefits in a safe and productive workplace.  In addition, we pride ourselves in providing our employees with career-growth opportunities while expecting them to be responsible and to uphold Scepter's principles and goals.
Scepter seeks to enrich our communities through partnerships with United Way, United Way Canada, and The Tennessee State Scholars Initiative.
