Fannie Mae: from legacy to startup


        You'd be forgiven for thinking that a quasi-federal agency founded in the 1930s is the last place you’d describe using words like innovative or agile. But you’d be wrong. Defying all stereotypes, Fannie Mae’s recent actions read a lot more like a startup than a $2.8 billion company with more than 7,000 employees. In the last two years, the company has implemented a user experience strategy, adopted design thinking and accelerated time to market for an innovative array of products.

Prime status: an update on luxury residential real estate


Deborah Huso


Real Estate


        In the years leading up to the housing bubble of 2007, it seemed like everyone was getting a piece of the American Dream of homeownership (or maybe even second homeownership). Ten years after the Great Recession, how is luxury residential real estate faring? Was the recent market slowdown just a temporary blip on the radar and will the sector continue to draw the aspirational interest of buyers as it did in the early to mid-2000s?
      


Commentary

Convert leads like a top producer



Casey Cunningham


Lending


        Most mortgage professionals know that the client feels a sense of loyalty to the first person they speak with. When they establish themselves as the first contact, loan officers gain a critical sales advantage. In fact, speed-to-call is the single largest driver of conversion for new customer leads. 
Studies show that returning a call from a new customer within the first 30 minutes produces an average of a 62% increase in conversion rates.

The Jetslide for Boat / PWC Lift

The JETSLIDE is a unique patented dry dock system that protects the hull of your watercraft from the accumulation of shellfish and marine vegetation. Over time, these kinds of accumulations could affect your boat’s performance. With the JETSLIDE, you’ll eliminate both maintenance costs and premature wear and tear on your watercraft. It’s easy to assemble, clean, esthetic, very flexible, and compatible with different types of watercraft. The JETSLIDE also enables you to walk safely around your pleasure craft. No more metal structures obstructing your view. The JETSLIDE requires no maintenance.

Rowing Platforms

Our products are so stable and buoyant that rowers never get wet when handling their boat near the floating dock.
Candock has always offered a specially-adapted version of its floating cubes for low-profile craft. Over the years, the team has been able to provide its rowing docks  to several local rowing clubs as well as clubs that compete on an international level.  Many of these competitions were supervised by FISA (International Federation of Rowing Associations) which understands the benefits of our products.This is especially true during major events when price is an important issue.
Candock’s success in this market is due to the durability, buoyancy, stability, zero maintenance, low cost and easy installation of its products.
