Company history[edit]
Early years[edit]
Rockwell Automation traces its history to 1903 and the formation of the Compression Rheostat Company, founded by Lynde Bradley and Dr. Stanton Allen with an initial investment of $1000. In 1904, 19-year-old Harry Bradley joined his brother in the business.
The company’s first patented product was a carbon disc compression-type motor controller for industrial cranes. The crane controller was demonstrated at the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904.
In 1909, the company was renamed the Allen-Bradley Company.
Allen-Bradley expanded rapidly during World War I in response to government-contracted work. Its product line grew to include automatic starters and switches, circuit breakers, relays and other electric equipment.
In 1914, Fred Loock established the company’s first sales office in New York.
Upon co-founder Stanton Allen’s death in 1916, Lynde Bradley became president. Harry Bradley was appointed vice president and attorney Louis Quarles was named corporate secretary.
In 1918 Allen-Bradley hired its first female factory worker, Julia Bizewski Polczynski, who was promoted to foreman the following year.
During the 1920s, the company grew its miniature rheostat business to support the burgeoning radio industry. By the middle of this decade, nearly 50 percent of the company’s sales were attributed to the radio department. The decade closed with record company sales of $3 million.
By 1932, the Great Depression had taken its toll and the company posted record losses. Amid growing economic pressure, Allen-Bradley reduced its workforce from 800 to 550 and cut wages by 50 percent. To lessen the financial burden, Lynde and Harry Bradley implemented a unique program: the company replaced employees’ lost wages with preferred stock. Eventually, the company bought back all stock at six percent interest.
Throughout this period, Lynde Bradley supported an aggressive research and development approach intended to “develop the company out of the Depression.” Lynde Bradley’s R&D strategy was successful. By 1937, Allen-Bradley employment had rebounded to pre-Depression levels and company sales reached an all-time high of nearly $4 million.
Mid-20th century[edit]
Following the death of Lynde Bradley in 1942, Harry Bradley became company president and Fred Loock was promoted to vice president. The Lynde Bradley Foundation, a charitable trust, was established with Lynde Bradley’s assets. The foundation’s first gift of $12,500 was made to Milwaukee’s Community Fund, predecessor of the United Way.
World War II fueled unprecedented levels of production, with 80 percent of the company’s orders being war-related. Wartime orders were centered on two broad lines of products – industrial controls to speed production and electrical components or “radio parts” used in a wide range of military equipment.
Allen-Bradley expanded its facilities numerous times during the 1940s to meet war-time production needs. With Fred Loock serving as president and Harry Bradley as chairman, the company began a major $1 million, two-year expansion project in 1947. The company completed additional expansions at its Milwaukee facilities in the 1950s and 1960s, including the Allen-Bradley clock tower. The clock tower has since been renamed, and is known today as the Rockwell Automation clock tower.
Harry Bradley died in 1965. Fred Loock retired in 1967 and died in 1973.
Late 20th century[edit]
During the 1970s, the company expanded its production facilities and markets and entered the 1980s as a global company. With president J. Tracy O'Rourke (1981–89) at the helm, the company introduced a new line of programmable logic controllers, the PLC-3, in 1981.
In 1985 privately owned Allen-Bradley set a new fiscal record with sales of $1 billion. On February 20, 1985 Rockwell International purchased Allen-Bradley for $1.651 billion; this was the largest acquisition in Wisconsin's history to date.[2] For all intents and purposes, Allen-Bradley took over Rockwell's industrial automation division.
The 1990s featured continued technology development, including the company’s launch of its software business, Rockwell Software (1994), the Logix control platform (1997) and the Integrated Architecture system (1999).
During this decade, Rockwell International also acquired a power systems business, composed of Reliance Electric and Dodge. These two brands, combined with control systems brands Allen-Bradley and Rockwell Software, were marketed as Rockwell Automation.
In 1998, Keith Nosbusch was named president of Rockwell Automation Control Systems. Rockwell International Corporation headquarters was moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin the same year. [3]
21st century[edit]
In 2002, Rockwell International split into two companies. The industrial automation division became Rockwell Automation, while the avionics division became Rockwell Collins.[4] The split was structured so that Rockwell Automation was the legal successor of Rockwell International, while Rockwell Collins was the spin-off. Rockwell Automation retains Rockwell International's stock price history, and continues to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ROK".
Keith Nosbusch was named chief executive officer in 2004.[5]
In 2007, Rockwell Automation sold the Power Systems division for $1.8 billion to Baldor Electric Company [6] to focus on its core competencies in automation and information technology.
In April 2016, it was announced that Keith Nosbusch would be replaced by Blake Moret, effective July 1, 2016. Nosbusch would remain with Rockwell Automation as chairman.[1] Moret was previously the senior vice president of the Control Products and Solutions segment of the company.[7]
Operations[edit]
Business segments[edit]
Rockwell Automation operates its business through two segments – Architecture and Software, and Control Products and Solutions.

The Architecture and Software segment contains key elements of the Rockwell Automation control and information platforms, software applications and automation components.
Control Products and Solutions consists of motor control products and services.

Products[edit]
The Rockwell Automation portfolio includes control systems, industrial control components, information software, motor control devices, sensing devices, network technology, safety technology, and industrial security.
Services[edit]
Rockwell Automation solutions include engineered systems that range from custom-designed, bundled components to large, turnkey system integration projects. Services include repair, asset management consulting and remote support centers and training.

Company history[edit]
Early years[edit]
Rockwell Automation traces its history to 1903 and the formation of the Compression Rheostat Company, founded by Lynde Bradley and Dr. Stanton Allen with an initial investment of $1000. In 1904, 19-year-old Harry Bradley joined his brother in the business.
The company’s first patented product was a carbon disc compression-type motor controller for industrial cranes. The crane controller was demonstrated at the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904.
In 1909, the company was renamed the Allen-Bradley Company.
Allen-Bradley expanded rapidly during World War I in response to government-contracted work. Its product line grew to include automatic starters and switches, circuit breakers, relays and other electric equipment.
In 1914, Fred Loock established the company’s first sales office in New York.
Upon co-founder Stanton Allen’s death in 1916, Lynde Bradley became president. Harry Bradley was appointed vice president and attorney Louis Quarles was named corporate secretary.
In 1918 Allen-Bradley hired its first female factory worker, Julia Bizewski Polczynski, who was promoted to foreman the following year.
During the 1920s, the company grew its miniature rheostat business to support the burgeoning radio industry. By the middle of this decade, nearly 50 percent of the company’s sales were attributed to the radio department. The decade closed with record company sales of $3 million.
By 1932, the Great Depression had taken its toll and the company posted record losses. Amid growing economic pressure, Allen-Bradley reduced its workforce from 800 to 550 and cut wages by 50 percent. To lessen the financial burden, Lynde and Harry Bradley implemented a unique program: the company replaced employees’ lost wages with preferred stock. Eventually, the company bought back all stock at six percent interest.
Throughout this period, Lynde Bradley supported an aggressive research and development approach intended to “develop the company out of the Depression.” Lynde Bradley’s R&D strategy was successful. By 1937, Allen-Bradley employment had rebounded to pre-Depression levels and company sales reached an all-time high of nearly $4 million.
Mid-20th century[edit]
Following the death of Lynde Bradley in 1942, Harry Bradley became company president and Fred Loock was promoted to vice president. The Lynde Bradley Foundation, a charitable trust, was established with Lynde Bradley’s assets. The foundation’s first gift of $12,500 was made to Milwaukee’s Community Fund, predecessor of the United Way.
World War II fueled unprecedented levels of production, with 80 percent of the company’s orders being war-related. Wartime orders were centered on two broad lines of products – industrial controls to speed production and electrical components or “radio parts” used in a wide range of military equipment.
Allen-Bradley expanded its facilities numerous times during the 1940s to meet war-time production needs. With Fred Loock serving as president and Harry Bradley as chairman, the company began a major $1 million, two-year expansion project in 1947. The company completed additional expansions at its Milwaukee facilities in the 1950s and 1960s, including the Allen-Bradley clock tower. The clock tower has since been renamed, and is known today as the Rockwell Automation clock tower.
Harry Bradley died in 1965. Fred Loock retired in 1967 and died in 1973.
Late 20th century[edit]
During the 1970s, the company expanded its production facilities and markets and entered the 1980s as a global company. With president J. Tracy O'Rourke (1981–89) at the helm, the company introduced a new line of programmable logic controllers, the PLC-3, in 1981.
In 1985 privately owned Allen-Bradley set a new fiscal record with sales of $1 billion. On February 20, 1985 Rockwell International purchased Allen-Bradley for $1.651 billion; this was the largest acquisition in Wisconsin's history to date.[2] For all intents and purposes, Allen-Bradley took over Rockwell's industrial automation division.
The 1990s featured continued technology development, including the company’s launch of its software business, Rockwell Software (1994), the Logix control platform (1997) and the Integrated Architecture system (1999).
During this decade, Rockwell International also acquired a power systems business, composed of Reliance Electric and Dodge. These two brands, combined with control systems brands Allen-Bradley and Rockwell Software, were marketed as Rockwell Automation.
In 1998, Keith Nosbusch was named president of Rockwell Automation Control Systems. Rockwell International Corporation headquarters was moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin the same year. [3]
21st century[edit]
In 2002, Rockwell International split into two companies. The industrial automation division became Rockwell Automation, while the avionics division became Rockwell Collins.[4] The split was structured so that Rockwell Automation was the legal successor of Rockwell International, while Rockwell Collins was the spin-off. Rockwell Automation retains Rockwell International's stock price history, and continues to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ROK".
Keith Nosbusch was named chief executive officer in 2004.[5]
In 2007, Rockwell Automation sold the Power Systems division for $1.8 billion to Baldor Electric Company [6] to focus on its core competencies in automation and information technology.
In April 2016, it was announced that Keith Nosbusch would be replaced by Blake Moret, effective July 1, 2016. Nosbusch would remain with Rockwell Automation as chairman.[1] Moret was previously the senior vice president of the Control Products and Solutions segment of the company.[7]
Operations[edit]

Rockwell Automation Upgraded to Buy on Bright Prospects


July 11, 2017, 09:21:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 On Jul 11, Rockwell Automation Inc. ROK  was upgraded by a notch to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Going by the Zacks model, companies carrying a Zacks Rank #2 have better chances of performing above the broader market over the upcoming quarters.   Why the Upgrade?    Market sentiments has been favourable to Rockwell Automation for quite some time now, especially after the company reported better-than-expected results in the first half of fiscal 2017. Earnings surprise was a positive 20.69% in the first quarter while in the recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2017, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.71%. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.55 in second-quarter fiscal 2017, up 13% from $1.37 earned in the prior-year quarter.       Year to date, Rockwell Automation's shares yielded a return of 23.7%, outperforming the 22.8% gain recorded by the Zacks categorized Industrial Automation and Robotics  sub industry.    Backed by strong performance in first-half fiscal 2017, the company had increased fiscal 2017 sales growth guidance to the range of 4.5-7.5%. Further, it now anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.45-$6.75. Compared with earnings per share of $5.93 in fiscal 2016, the mid-point of the range depicts a year-over-year climb of 11%. As the macro environment continues to improve, the consumer and transportation verticals are expected to deliver consistent growth. Heavy industries are anticipated to grow in 2017 despite the prevailing softness in oil and gas and mining.    Rockwell Automation's new Connected Enterprise (CE) integrated supply chain management system will be a catalyst. The company is increasing the number of industries, applications and geographies, as well as improving investments to expand the value of CE. With average profitability well above the corporate average, CE sales will be an integral part of Rockwell Automation's incremental growth and provide boost to margins over the next few years. Further, it remains active on the acquisition front. The company made three acquisitions during fiscal 2016 - Automation Control Products, MagneMotion and MAVERICK Technologies which further strengthened its technology differentiation, increased domain expertise and expanded presence in the markets.    Rockwell Automation continues to target long-term revenue growth of 6-8%, delivering double-digit EPS growth, return on invested capital (ROIC) of more than 20% over the long term and cash flow of around 100% of adjusted income. These long-term goals will be supported by the company's strategy of diversifying sales streams by way of expanding products portfolio, solutions and services as well as global presence. The company also aims to achieve growth rates in excess of the automation market by expanding its served market, strengthening competitive differentiation, and serving a wider range of industries and applications.   Rockwell Automation, Inc. Price and Consensus          Rockwell Automation, Inc. Price and Consensus    |      Rockwell Automation, Inc. Quote      Investors seem to be optimistic about Rockwell Automation's   future prospects, as evident from year-over-year earnings growth   of 11.96% for fiscal 2017 and 9.44% for fiscal 2018.

Company history[edit]
Early years[edit]
Rockwell Automation traces its history to 1903 and the formation of the Compression Rheostat Company, founded by Lynde Bradley and Dr. Stanton Allen with an initial investment of $1000. In 1904, 19-year-old Harry Bradley joined his brother in the business.
The company’s first patented product was a carbon disc compression-type motor controller for industrial cranes. The crane controller was demonstrated at the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904.
In 1909, the company was renamed the Allen-Bradley Company.
Allen-Bradley expanded rapidly during World War I in response to government-contracted work. Its product line grew to include automatic starters and switches, circuit breakers, relays and other electric equipment.
In 1914, Fred Loock established the company’s first sales office in New York.
Upon co-founder Stanton Allen’s death in 1916, Lynde Bradley became president. Harry Bradley was appointed vice president and attorney Louis Quarles was named corporate secretary.
In 1918 Allen-Bradley hired its first female factory worker, Julia Bizewski Polczynski, who was promoted to foreman the following year.
During the 1920s, the company grew its miniature rheostat business to support the burgeoning radio industry. By the middle of this decade, nearly 50 percent of the company’s sales were attributed to the radio department. The decade closed with record company sales of $3 million.
By 1932, the Great Depression had taken its toll and the company posted record losses. Amid growing economic pressure, Allen-Bradley reduced its workforce from 800 to 550 and cut wages by 50 percent. To lessen the financial burden, Lynde and Harry Bradley implemented a unique program: the company replaced employees’ lost wages with preferred stock. Eventually, the company bought back all stock at six percent interest.
Throughout this period, Lynde Bradley supported an aggressive research and development approach intended to “develop the company out of the Depression.” Lynde Bradley’s R&D strategy was successful. By 1937, Allen-Bradley employment had rebounded to pre-Depression levels and company sales reached an all-time high of nearly $4 million.
Mid-20th century[edit]
Following the death of Lynde Bradley in 1942, Harry Bradley became company president and Fred Loock was promoted to vice president. The Lynde Bradley Foundation, a charitable trust, was established with Lynde Bradley’s assets. The foundation’s first gift of $12,500 was made to Milwaukee’s Community Fund, predecessor of the United Way.
World War II fueled unprecedented levels of production, with 80 percent of the company’s orders being war-related. Wartime orders were centered on two broad lines of products – industrial controls to speed production and electrical components or “radio parts” used in a wide range of military equipment.
Allen-Bradley expanded its facilities numerous times during the 1940s to meet war-time production needs. With Fred Loock serving as president and Harry Bradley as chairman, the company began a major $1 million, two-year expansion project in 1947. The company completed additional expansions at its Milwaukee facilities in the 1950s and 1960s, including the Allen-Bradley clock tower. The clock tower has since been renamed, and is known today as the Rockwell Automation clock tower.
Harry Bradley died in 1965. Fred Loock retired in 1967 and died in 1973.
Late 20th century[edit]
During the 1970s, the company expanded its production facilities and markets and entered the 1980s as a global company. With president J. Tracy O'Rourke (1981–89) at the helm, the company introduced a new line of programmable logic controllers, the PLC-3, in 1981.
In 1985 privately owned Allen-Bradley set a new fiscal record with sales of $1 billion. On February 20, 1985 Rockwell International purchased Allen-Bradley for $1.651 billion; this was the largest acquisition in Wisconsin's history to date.[2] For all intents and purposes, Allen-Bradley took over Rockwell's industrial automation division.
The 1990s featured continued technology development, including the company’s launch of its software business, Rockwell Software (1994), the Logix control platform (1997) and the Integrated Architecture system (1999).
During this decade, Rockwell International also acquired a power systems business, composed of Reliance Electric and Dodge. These two brands, combined with control systems brands Allen-Bradley and Rockwell Software, were marketed as Rockwell Automation.
In 1998, Keith Nosbusch was named president of Rockwell Automation Control Systems. Rockwell International Corporation headquarters was moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin the same year. [3]
21st century[edit]
In 2002, Rockwell International split into two companies. The industrial automation division became Rockwell Automation, while the avionics division became Rockwell Collins.[4] The split was structured so that Rockwell Automation was the legal successor of Rockwell International, while Rockwell Collins was the spin-off. Rockwell Automation retains Rockwell International's stock price history, and continues to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ROK".
Keith Nosbusch was named chief executive officer in 2004.[5]
In 2007, Rockwell Automation sold the Power Systems division for $1.8 billion to Baldor Electric Company [6] to focus on its core competencies in automation and information technology.
In April 2016, it was announced that Keith Nosbusch would be replaced by Blake Moret, effective July 1, 2016. Nosbusch would remain with Rockwell Automation as chairman.[1] Moret was previously the senior vice president of the Control Products and Solutions segment of the company.[7]
Operations[edit]
Business segments[edit]
Rockwell Automation operates its business through two segments – Architecture and Software, and Control Products and Solutions.

The Architecture and Software segment contains key elements of the Rockwell Automation control and information platforms, software applications and automation components.
Control Products and Solutions consists of motor control products and services.

Products[edit]
The Rockwell Automation portfolio includes control systems, industrial control components, information software, motor control devices, sensing devices, network technology, safety technology, and industrial security.
Services[edit]
Rockwell Automation solutions include engineered systems that range from custom-designed, bundled components to large, turnkey system integration projects. Services include repair, asset management consulting and remote support centers and training.

Company history[edit]
Early years[edit]
Rockwell Automation traces its history to 1903 and the formation of the Compression Rheostat Company, founded by Lynde Bradley and Dr. Stanton Allen with an initial investment of $1000. In 1904, 19-year-old Harry Bradley joined his brother in the business.
The company’s first patented product was a carbon disc compression-type motor controller for industrial cranes. The crane controller was demonstrated at the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904.
In 1909, the company was renamed the Allen-Bradley Company.
Allen-Bradley expanded rapidly during World War I in response to government-contracted work. Its product line grew to include automatic starters and switches, circuit breakers, relays and other electric equipment.
In 1914, Fred Loock established the company’s first sales office in New York.
Upon co-founder Stanton Allen’s death in 1916, Lynde Bradley became president. Harry Bradley was appointed vice president and attorney Louis Quarles was named corporate secretary.
In 1918 Allen-Bradley hired its first female factory worker, Julia Bizewski Polczynski, who was promoted to foreman the following year.
During the 1920s, the company grew its miniature rheostat business to support the burgeoning radio industry. By the middle of this decade, nearly 50 percent of the company’s sales were attributed to the radio department. The decade closed with record company sales of $3 million.
By 1932, the Great Depression had taken its toll and the company posted record losses. Amid growing economic pressure, Allen-Bradley reduced its workforce from 800 to 550 and cut wages by 50 percent. To lessen the financial burden, Lynde and Harry Bradley implemented a unique program: the company replaced employees’ lost wages with preferred stock. Eventually, the company bought back all stock at six percent interest.
Throughout this period, Lynde Bradley supported an aggressive research and development approach intended to “develop the company out of the Depression.” Lynde Bradley’s R&D strategy was successful. By 1937, Allen-Bradley employment had rebounded to pre-Depression levels and company sales reached an all-time high of nearly $4 million.
Mid-20th century[edit]
Following the death of Lynde Bradley in 1942, Harry Bradley became company president and Fred Loock was promoted to vice president. The Lynde Bradley Foundation, a charitable trust, was established with Lynde Bradley’s assets. The foundation’s first gift of $12,500 was made to Milwaukee’s Community Fund, predecessor of the United Way.
World War II fueled unprecedented levels of production, with 80 percent of the company’s orders being war-related. Wartime orders were centered on two broad lines of products – industrial controls to speed production and electrical components or “radio parts” used in a wide range of military equipment.
Allen-Bradley expanded its facilities numerous times during the 1940s to meet war-time production needs. With Fred Loock serving as president and Harry Bradley as chairman, the company began a major $1 million, two-year expansion project in 1947. The company completed additional expansions at its Milwaukee facilities in the 1950s and 1960s, including the Allen-Bradley clock tower. The clock tower has since been renamed, and is known today as the Rockwell Automation clock tower.
Harry Bradley died in 1965. Fred Loock retired in 1967 and died in 1973.
Late 20th century[edit]
During the 1970s, the company expanded its production facilities and markets and entered the 1980s as a global company. With president J. Tracy O'Rourke (1981–89) at the helm, the company introduced a new line of programmable logic controllers, the PLC-3, in 1981.
In 1985 privately owned Allen-Bradley set a new fiscal record with sales of $1 billion. On February 20, 1985 Rockwell International purchased Allen-Bradley for $1.651 billion; this was the largest acquisition in Wisconsin's history to date.[2] For all intents and purposes, Allen-Bradley took over Rockwell's industrial automation division.
The 1990s featured continued technology development, including the company’s launch of its software business, Rockwell Software (1994), the Logix control platform (1997) and the Integrated Architecture system (1999).
During this decade, Rockwell International also acquired a power systems business, composed of Reliance Electric and Dodge. These two brands, combined with control systems brands Allen-Bradley and Rockwell Software, were marketed as Rockwell Automation.
In 1998, Keith Nosbusch was named president of Rockwell Automation Control Systems. Rockwell International Corporation headquarters was moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin the same year. [3]
21st century[edit]
In 2002, Rockwell International split into two companies. The industrial automation division became Rockwell Automation, while the avionics division became Rockwell Collins.[4] The split was structured so that Rockwell Automation was the legal successor of Rockwell International, while Rockwell Collins was the spin-off. Rockwell Automation retains Rockwell International's stock price history, and continues to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ROK".
Keith Nosbusch was named chief executive officer in 2004.[5]
In 2007, Rockwell Automation sold the Power Systems division for $1.8 billion to Baldor Electric Company [6] to focus on its core competencies in automation and information technology.
In April 2016, it was announced that Keith Nosbusch would be replaced by Blake Moret, effective July 1, 2016. Nosbusch would remain with Rockwell Automation as chairman.[1] Moret was previously the senior vice president of the Control Products and Solutions segment of the company.[7]
Operations[edit]
Business segments[edit]
Rockwell Automation operates its business through two segments – Architecture and Software, and Control Products and Solutions.

The Architecture and Software segment contains key elements of the Rockwell Automation control and information platforms, software applications and automation components.
Control Products and Solutions consists of motor control products and services.

Products[edit]
The Rockwell Automation portfolio includes control systems, industrial control components, information software, motor control devices, sensing devices, network technology, safety technology, and industrial security.
Services[edit]
Rockwell Automation solutions include engineered systems that range from custom-designed, bundled components to large, turnkey system integration projects. Services include repair, asset management consulting and remote support centers and training.

Company history[edit]
Early years[edit]
Rockwell Automation traces its history to 1903 and the formation of the Compression Rheostat Company, founded by Lynde Bradley and Dr. Stanton Allen with an initial investment of $1000. In 1904, 19-year-old Harry Bradley joined his brother in the business.
The company’s first patented product was a carbon disc compression-type motor controller for industrial cranes. The crane controller was demonstrated at the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904.
In 1909, the company was renamed the Allen-Bradley Company.
Allen-Bradley expanded rapidly during World War I in response to government-contracted work. Its product line grew to include automatic starters and switches, circuit breakers, relays and other electric equipment.
In 1914, Fred Loock established the company’s first sales office in New York.
Upon co-founder Stanton Allen’s death in 1916, Lynde Bradley became president. Harry Bradley was appointed vice president and attorney Louis Quarles was named corporate secretary.
In 1918 Allen-Bradley hired its first female factory worker, Julia Bizewski Polczynski, who was promoted to foreman the following year.
During the 1920s, the company grew its miniature rheostat business to support the burgeoning radio industry. By the middle of this decade, nearly 50 percent of the company’s sales were attributed to the radio department. The decade closed with record company sales of $3 million.
By 1932, the Great Depression had taken its toll and the company posted record losses. Amid growing economic pressure, Allen-Bradley reduced its workforce from 800 to 550 and cut wages by 50 percent. To lessen the financial burden, Lynde and Harry Bradley implemented a unique program: the company replaced employees’ lost wages with preferred stock. Eventually, the company bought back all stock at six percent interest.
Throughout this period, Lynde Bradley supported an aggressive research and development approach intended to “develop the company out of the Depression.” Lynde Bradley’s R&D strategy was successful. By 1937, Allen-Bradley employment had rebounded to pre-Depression levels and company sales reached an all-time high of nearly $4 million.
Mid-20th century[edit]
Following the death of Lynde Bradley in 1942, Harry Bradley became company president and Fred Loock was promoted to vice president. The Lynde Bradley Foundation, a charitable trust, was established with Lynde Bradley’s assets. The foundation’s first gift of $12,500 was made to Milwaukee’s Community Fund, predecessor of the United Way.
World War II fueled unprecedented levels of production, with 80 percent of the company’s orders being war-related. Wartime orders were centered on two broad lines of products – industrial controls to speed production and electrical components or “radio parts” used in a wide range of military equipment.
Allen-Bradley expanded its facilities numerous times during the 1940s to meet war-time production needs. With Fred Loock serving as president and Harry Bradley as chairman, the company began a major $1 million, two-year expansion project in 1947. The company completed additional expansions at its Milwaukee facilities in the 1950s and 1960s, including the Allen-Bradley clock tower. The clock tower has since been renamed, and is known today as the Rockwell Automation clock tower.
Harry Bradley died in 1965. Fred Loock retired in 1967 and died in 1973.
Late 20th century[edit]
During the 1970s, the company expanded its production facilities and markets and entered the 1980s as a global company. With president J. Tracy O'Rourke (1981–89) at the helm, the company introduced a new line of programmable logic controllers, the PLC-3, in 1981.
In 1985 privately owned Allen-Bradley set a new fiscal record with sales of $1 billion. On February 20, 1985 Rockwell International purchased Allen-Bradley for $1.651 billion; this was the largest acquisition in Wisconsin's history to date.[2] For all intents and purposes, Allen-Bradley took over Rockwell's industrial automation division.
The 1990s featured continued technology development, including the company’s launch of its software business, Rockwell Software (1994), the Logix control platform (1997) and the Integrated Architecture system (1999).
During this decade, Rockwell International also acquired a power systems business, composed of Reliance Electric and Dodge. These two brands, combined with control systems brands Allen-Bradley and Rockwell Software, were marketed as Rockwell Automation.
In 1998, Keith Nosbusch was named president of Rockwell Automation Control Systems. Rockwell International Corporation headquarters was moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin the same year. [3]
21st century[edit]
In 2002, Rockwell International split into two companies. The industrial automation division became Rockwell Automation, while the avionics division became Rockwell Collins.[4] The split was structured so that Rockwell Automation was the legal successor of Rockwell International, while Rockwell Collins was the spin-off. Rockwell Automation retains Rockwell International's stock price history, and continues to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ROK".
Keith Nosbusch was named chief executive officer in 2004.[5]
In 2007, Rockwell Automation sold the Power Systems division for $1.8 billion to Baldor Electric Company [6] to focus on its core competencies in automation and information technology.
In April 2016, it was announced that Keith Nosbusch would be replaced by Blake Moret, effective July 1, 2016. Nosbusch would remain with Rockwell Automation as chairman.[1] Moret was previously the senior vice president of the Control Products and Solutions segment of the company.[7]
Operations[edit]
Business segments[edit]
Rockwell Automation operates its business through two segments – Architecture and Software, and Control Products and Solutions.

The Architecture and Software segment contains key elements of the Rockwell Automation control and information platforms, software applications and automation components.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
