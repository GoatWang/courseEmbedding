CREATING, IMPROVING, AND MAINTAINING COMPLEX SPACE SYSTEMS
Space systems infrastructure is a complex system-of-systems that involves space, ground, and user components. The intricate connections between these three major components—with the added complication that we cannot modify elements once deployed in space—create myriad challenges for our customers. The Aerospace Corporation uses the expertise and experience of our technical staff to find innovative solutions to these challenges in space systems infrastructures.
Aerospace research focuses on fields pertaining to space and space-related systems. Our scientists and engineers collect comprehensive data, which is then integrated, analyzed, compared, and contrasted with other data and made available to our customers. They then apply this information to define needs and conceptualize architectures for our nation’s future space systems.
Learn More







SUPPORTING PRESENT AND FUTURE MISSION SUCCESS
The Aerospace Corporation’s fundamental research and development specializes in advanced military and civilian space systems. These space systems utilize aspects of virtually every physical science and must operate in the harshest and most unforgiving of environments. To ensure mission success, Aerospace recognizes the necessity of conducting research and development in a single location, which allows for complementary knowledge-sharing among our scientists and engineers from a wide variety disciplines, as well as ease of interdepartmental support when necessary.
Our Physical Science Laboratories (PSL) provide a secure, self-contained organization with resources powerful enough to allow complete self-reliance. PSL operates more than 80 specialized laboratories in support of Aerospace’s fundamental research and development, gathered into three focus areas—the Electronics and Photonics Laboratory (EPL), the Space Materials Laboratory (SML), and the Space Science Applications Laboratory (SSAL).
Learn More







LEVERAGING OUR EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE FOR OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS
For virtually the entire history of the nation’s civilian and military space programs, The Aerospace Corporation has worked to address and solve program anomalies, characterize the space environment, and develop methods to operate within it. Repurposing our technical tools and skills to create unique solutions to challenges in the private sector is a key asset for the corporation and a huge benefit for our customers.
Aerospace leverages intellectual property via licensing agreements and other mechanisms, creating access to a repository of technology and other tools that has resulted from decades of research, experience, and lessons learned. Aerospace holds more than 550 patents, and our scientists and engineers are continually adding new technologies and inventions to the collection.

Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

TAHAWI
Aerospace Corp
Up
to 10,000,000 Common Shares of Common Stock 
Minimum purchase: 500 Shares ($1000) 
We
are offering up to 10,000,000 shares of class A common stock on a “best
efforts” basis, with a minimum amount of 2,500,000 securities that must be
purchased, all investor funds will be available to the company upon
commencement of this Offering if the minimum has been reached, the investor
funds will be returned if an insufficient amount of shares are not sold to
cover the minimum of this Offering. The shares will be issued in the minimum
amount of 500 common shares ($1000) and in multiples of 500 shares. 
The
Offering is being made pursuant to Tier 1 of Regulation A, promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933. Each share will be offered at its principal amount,
two dollars ($2.00). There is a minimum purchase amount of 500 shares, for an
aggregate purchase price of One Thousand ($1000.00) dollars. 
Investing
in this offering involves high degree of risk, and you should not invest unless
you can afford to lose your entire investment. See “Risk Factors” beginning
on page 5. This offering circular relates to the offer and sale or other
disposition of up to ten million shares (10,000,000) class A Common Shares, at
a fixed price of $2 per share. See “Securities Being Offered” beginning on page
35.
 
This
is our offering, and no public market currently exists for our common shares.
The Offering price may not reflect the market price of our shares after the
Offering. The Company presently does not intend to seek such listing for its
common stock, but should it hereinafter elect to do so, there can be no
assurances that such listing will ever materialize. 
 
The
proposed sale will begin as soon as practicable after this Offering Circular
has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and
the relevant state regulators, as necessary. The offering will continue until
the Company has sold all of the shares offered hereby or on such earlier date
as the Company may terminate the Offering. The shares offered hereby are
offered on a “best efforts” basis, and there is no minimum offering.
 
The
Offering will terminate at the earlier of: (1) the date at which the maximum
offering amount has been subscribed, (2) the date which is one year from this
Offering Statement being qualified by the Commission, or (3) the date at which
the Offering is earlier terminated by the company in its sole discretion.
 
We
have made no arrangements to place subscription proceeds or funds in an escrow,
trust or similar account, which means that the proceeds or funds from the sale
of shares will be immediately available to us for use in our operations and
once received and accepted are irrevocable if we reach the minimum offering.
See “Plan of Distribution” and “Securities Being Offered” for a description of
our capital stock.
 
An
offering statement pursuant to Regulation “A” relating to these securities has
been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information contained
in this Preliminary Offering Circular is subject to completion or amendment.
These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted before the
offering statement filed with the Commission is qualified. This Preliminary
Offering Circular shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of
an offer to buy nor may there be any sales of these securities in any state in
which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful before registration or
qualification under the laws of any such state. We may elect to satisfy our
obligation to deliver a Final Offering Circular by sending you a notice within
two business days after the completion of our sale to you that contains the URL
where the Final Offering Circular or the offering statement in which such Final
Offering Circular was filed may be obtained.

Please note that the Company is a
“shell” company in accordance with Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933. Accordingly, any securities sold in this offering can only be
resold through registration under the Securities Act of 1933; Section 4(1), if
available, for non-affiliates; or by meeting the following conditions of Rule
144(i): (a) the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has
ceased to be a shell company; (b) the issuer of the securities is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(D) of the Exchange Act of 1934;
and the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and
material required to be filed during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter
period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other
than Form 8-K reports; and at least one year has lapsed from the time that the
issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the Commission reflecting
its status as an entity that is not a shell company. For purposes herein,
following the effectiveness of this Offering Statement, the Company will not be
subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Thus, the Company
will be required to file another registration statement and become subject to
the reporting requirements thereof in order to potentially provide for the
application of Rule 144.

Aerospace Corp began operations in 2016. TAHAWI Aerospace is acquiring the assets
of Mael Aircraft and will close on the assets upon a successful offering:  MAEL
AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING COMPANY has one FAA Type A (A Type Certificate number
A6S0 - BA-42) with modifications for two variations of prototype airplanes, one
for four passenger, twin-engine aircraft and the other for- six passenger,
twin-engine aircraft. Both certificate and prototype aircrafts are included in
our IP along with a partially assembled plane in the construction jig, a static
plane model used to superimpose load factors for stress and structure, all
dies, jigs and molds utilized to fabricate the airplane parts, enough formed
parts for 1-3 aircraft frames and all available raw materials. In addition, all
intellectual property rights and patents associated with the aircraft as well
as all available blueprints, designs, catalog and card files and books used to
construct the aircraft are also included in the sale. Originally these aircraft
were part of a Sam Burns/Mississippi State University study to develop lightweight
fuel-efficient passenger planes that could be converted to jets in the 1970s.
Both aircraft feature twin reciprocating engines utilizing semi-monologue, an
all-aluminum basic frame structure with fiberglass nose, tail, wing tips,
fairings and cowls, a circular fuselage at mid-wing and a tail in a low drag
design that is aerodynamically smooth construction. Also, a cabin air-operated
stairway entrance opens into a depressed center walkway. The tricycle landing
gear is hydraulically operated as well as fully retractable. Electrically
operated flaps are slotted with a long lip and large radius. This FAA Type
Certificate is "immediate production" ready and reflects several
years' worth of extensive engineering and investment by NASA. TAHAWI analyzed
the market for the four and six passages and limited cargo aircrafts and
determined that existing aircraft are highly priced and not fuel efficient.
TAHAWI believes that offering a product that 30% cheaper and cost effective in
this niche markets is highly needed.

Investing
  in our shares involves a high degree of risk. As an investor you should be
  able to bear a complete loss of your investment. You should carefully
  consider the information set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this
  Offering Circular.

2.     
RISK FACTORS
Investing
in our shares involves risk. In evaluating TAHAWI Aerospace Corp and an
investment in the shares, careful consideration should be given to the
following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this
Offering Circular. Each of these risk factors could materially adversely affect
TAHAWI’s business, operating results or financial condition, as well as
adversely affect the value of an investment in our shares. The following is a
summary of the most significant factors that make this offering speculative or
substantially risky. The company is still subject to all the same risks that
all companies in its industry, and all companies in the economy, are exposed
to. These include risks relating to economic downturns, political and economic
events and technological developments. Additionally, early-stage companies are
inherently more risky than more developed companies. You should consider
general risks as well as specific risks when deciding whether to invest. 
We are an early
stage company and have not yet generated any revenues 
TAHAWI
has had no net income, and no revenues generated since its inception. There is
no assurance that TAHAWI will ever be profitable or generate sufficient revenue
to pay dividends to the holders of the shares. TAHAWI does not believe it will
be able to generate revenues without successfully fund raising, which involves
substantial risk. As a result, TAHAWI is dependent upon the proceeds of this
Offering and additional fund raises to start manufacturing its conventional
propeller 4 and 6 seats aircrafts. If planned operating levels are changed,
higher operating costs encountered, lower sales revenue received, more time is
needed to implement the plan, or less funding received from customer deposits
or sales, more funds than currently anticipated may be required. Additional
difficulties may be encountered during this stage of development, such as
unanticipated problems relating to development, testing, and initial and
continuing regulatory compliance, vendor manufacturing costs, production and
assembly, and the competitive and regulatory environments in which TAHAWI
intends to operate. If additional capital is not available when required, if at
all, or is not available on acceptable terms, TAHAWI may be forced to modify or
abandon its business plan. 
The company has
realized operating losses to date and expects to incur losses in the future 
The
company has operated at a loss since inception, and these losses are likely to
continue. TAHAWI’s net losses for 2016 were $10,000 respectively. Until the
company achieves profitability, it will have to seek other sources of capital
in order to continue operations. 
The company’s
management has issued a going concern opinion 
TAHAWI’s
management has issued a “going concern” opinion on the company’s financial
statements. The company has negative working capital, has incurred recurring
losses and recurring negative cash flow from operating activities, and has an
accumulated deficit which raises substantial doubt, in the opinion of the
board, about its ability to continue as a going concern. 
We are
controlled by our Chairman, whose interests may differ from those of the other
shareholders.

As
of the date of this Offering Circular, Adam Altahawi owns the majority of
shares of the company’s common stock, and his majority ownership might continue
even after the issuance of the shares. Therefore, Mr. Altahawi is now and could
be in the future in a position to elect or change the members of the board of
directors and to control TAHAWI’s business and affairs including certain
significant corporate actions, including but not limited to acquisitions, the
sale or purchase of assets and the issuance and sale of TAHAWI’ shares. TAHAWI
also may be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial
to the other holders of the shares without Mr. TAHAWI’s consent. Mr. TAHAWI’s
interests might differ from the interests of other shareholders. 

6
 
 

 
The
development period for the manufacturing facility 
Even
if it meets the development schedule, TAHAWI does not expect to deliver
aircraft until the second quarter of 2017 at the earliest. As a result, the
receipt of significant revenues is not anticipated until that time and may
occur later than projected. TAHAWI depends on receiving large amounts of
capital and other financing to complete its manufacturing facility, with no
assurance that TAHAWI will be successful in completing its development work or
becoming profitable. 
The company will
face significant market competition 
The
4 and 6 seats twin engine prop and turboprop aircrafts competes with a variety
of aircraft manufactured in the United States and abroad. Further, TAHAWI could
face competition from competitors of whom TAHAWI is not aware that have
developed or are developing technologies that will offer alternatives to the
TAHAWI’s aircrafts. Competitors could develop an aircraft that renders the
TAHAWI’s aircrafts less competitive than TAHAWI believes it will become. Many
existing potential competitors are well-established, have or may have
longer-standing relationships with customers and potential business partners,
have or may have greater name recognition, and have or may have access to
significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. 
Delays in
aircraft delivery schedules or cancellation of orders may adversely affect the
company’s financial results 
Once
TAHAWI begins its pre-sales program and begins receiving refundable deposits
for its aircrafts pursuant to its agreements, some or all deposit holders might
not transition to non-refundable purchase contracts until prior to aircraft
delivery, if at all. Aircraft customers might respond to weak economic
conditions by canceling orders, resulting in lower demand for our aircraft and
other materials, such as parts, or services, such as training, which the
company expects to generate revenue. Such events would have a material adverse
effect on TAHAWI’s financial results. 
Developing new
products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties 
TAHAWI
is currently has one FAA Type Certificate with modifications for 2 variations
of prototype airplanes, one for four passenger, twin-engine aircraft and the
other for six passenger, twin-engine aircraft. TAHAWI shall engineer and design
phase of the turboprop 6 and 10 seats aircrafts. Delays or cost overruns in the
development or certification of the turboprop and failure of the product to
meet its performance estimates could affect the company’s financial
performance. Delays and increased costs may be caused by unanticipated
technological hurdles, changes to design or failure on the part of TAHAWI’s
suppliers to deliver components as agreed. 
Operations
could be adversely affected by interruptions of production that are beyond the
company’s control

TAHAWI
intends to produce the Turboprop 6 and 10 seats, engines and components and
parts developed and manufactured by third-party suppliers. TAHAWI’s aircraft
development and production could be affected by interruptions of production at
such suppliers. Such suppliers may be subject to additional risks such as
financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations. If any
of these third parties experience difficulties, it may have a direct negative
impact on TAHAWI. 
The company has
one FAA Type Certificate with modifications for 2 variations of prototype
airplanes and will require additional FAA certifications for its proposed 6 and
10 seats turboprop.

7
 
 

 
The
company has one FAA Type Certificate (A Type Certificate number A6SO BA-42)
with modifications for 2 variations of prototype airplanes Certification which
shall go into production immediately under the attained FAA certificate, and
will need additional Federal Aviation Administration certification for the two
turboprop type aircrafts and the FAA certification required for the sale of the
TAHAWI’s turboprop aircrafts in the civil or commercial market in the United
States. The process to obtain such certification is expensive and time
consuming and has inherent engineering risks. These include (but are not
limited to) ground test risks such as structural strength and fatigue
resistance, and structural flutter modes. Flight test risks include (but are
not limited to) stability and handling over the desired center-of-gravity
range, performance extremes (stalls, balked-landing climb, single-engine
climb), and flutter control effectiveness (aircraft roll effectiveness,
controllability, various control failure safety). Delays in FAA certification
might result in TAHAWI incurring increased costs in attempting to correct any
issues causing such delays. Also, the impact of new or changed laws or
regulations on the turboprop certification or the costs of complying with such
laws and regulations cannot be predicted. Since TAHAWI will not be permitted to
deliver commercially produced turboprop aircraft to civilian customers until
obtaining certification, the only revenues will be generated from the existing
certificate to fund the operations.
We depend on key
personnel

TAHAWI’s
future success depends on the efforts of key personnel, including its senior
executive team. TAHAWI does not currently carry any key man life insurance on
its key personnel or its senior executive team. However, TAHAWI intends to
obtain such insurance upon closing this Offering. Regardless of such insurance,
the loss of services of any of these or other key personnel may have an adverse
effect on TAHAWI. There can be no assurance that TAHAWI will be successful in
attracting and retaining the personnel TAHAWI requires to develop and market
the existing aircrafts and the proposed turboprop aircraft and conduct TAHAWI’s
proposed operations. 
The company’s
estimates of market demand may be inaccurate 
TAHAWI
has projected the market for its aircrafts upon a variety of internal and
external market data. The estimates involve significant assumptions, which may
not be realized in fact. There can be no assurance that TAHAWI’s estimates for
the number of aircraft that may be sold in the market will be as anticipated.
In the event that TAHAWI has not accurately estimated the market size for and
the number of the aircrafts that may be sold, it could have a material adverse
effect upon TAHAWI, its results from operations, and an investment in the
shares. 
 
There is no
current market for the company’s shares 
There
is no formal marketplace for the resale of TAHAWI’s common stock. The shares
may be traded on the over-the-counter market to the extent any demand exists.
However, we do not have plans to apply for or otherwise seek trading or
quotation of the company’s shares on an over-the-counter market. Investors
should assume that they may not be able to liquidate their investment for some
time, or be able to pledge their shares as collateral.

3.     
DILUTION

If
you invest in our shares, your interest will be diluted to the extent of the
difference between the public offering price per share of our common stock and
the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our capital stock after
this Offering. The following table demonstrates the dilution that new investors
will experience relative to the company’s net tangible book value as of
September 30, 2016 of $5,505,000. Net tangible book value is the aggregate
amount of the company’s tangible assets, less its total liabilities. The table
presents three scenarios: a $5 million raise from this Offering, a $10 million
raise from this Offering and a fully subscribed $20 million raise from this
Offering.

Another important way of looking
at dilution is the dilution that happens due to future actions by the company.
The investor’s stake in a company could be diluted due to the company issuing
additional shares. In other words, when the company issues more shares, the
percentage of the company that you own will go down, even though the value of
the company may go up. You will own a smaller piece of a larger company. This
increase in number of shares outstanding could result from a stock offering
(such as an initial public offering, another crowd funding round, a venture
capital round, angel investment), employees exercising stock options, or by
conversion of certain instruments (e.g. convertible bonds, preferred shares or
warrants) into stock.  If
the company decides to issue more shares, an investor could experience value
dilution, with each share being worth less than before, and control dilution,
with the total percentage an investor owns being less than before. The company
has authorized and issued only one class or type of shares, common stock.
Therefore, all of the company’s current shareholders and the investors in this
Offering will experience the same dilution if the company decides to issue more
shares in the future.

4.      PLAN OF
DISTRIBUTION AND SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS 
No
securities are being sold for the account of security holders; all net proceeds
of this offering will go to the Company. We are offering a maximum of 10,000,000
shares of class A common stock on a “best efforts” basis. All subscribers will
be instructed by the company to transfer funds by wire or ACH transfer directly
to the a specially established account by the company for this Offering or
deliver checks made payable to TAHAWI aerospace Corp, the company shall deposit
into such account no later than noon the next business day after receipt. The
company may terminate the Offering at any time for any reason at its sole
discretion. The company will promptly return the funds to subscribers if we do
not sell 2,500,000 the minimum securities.
This
prospectus permits our officers and directors to sell the shares directly to
the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to them for any shares
they may sell.  There is no plan or arrangement to enter into any contracts or
agreements to sell the shares with a broker or dealer.  Our officers and
directors will sell the shares and intend to offer them to friends, family
members and business acquaintances.  There is a minimum amount of shares we
must sell so the money raised from the sale of our shares will go into especially
established account by the company.
The
shares are being offered directly by the Company and will be relying on the
safe harbor in Rule 3a4-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to sell the
shares.  No sales commission will be paid for shares sold by the company.  
After
the Offering Statement has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the company will accept tenders of funds to purchase the shares.
The company may close on investments on a “rolling” basis (so not all investors
will receive their shares on the same date. The funds tendered by potential
investors will be held by a special propos bank account, and will be transferred
to the company operating account upon Closing. 
We
are not selling the shares through commissioned sales agents or underwriters.
We will use our existing website, www.tahawiaerospace.com, to provide
notification of the Offering. 
This
Offering Circular will be furnished to prospective investors via download 24
hours per day, 7 days per week on our webpage.  
You
will be required to complete a subscription agreement in order to invest. The
subscription agreement includes a representation by the investor to the effect
that, if you are not an “accredited investor” as defined under securities law,
you are investing an amount that does not exceed the greater of 10% of your
annual income or 10% of your net worth (excluding your principal residence).  
The Offering
will terminate at the earlier of: (1) the date at which the maximum offering
amount has been subscribed, (2) the date which is one year from this Offering
Statement being qualified by the Commission, or (3) the date at which the
Offering is earlier terminated by the company in its sole discretion.

5.     
USE OF PROCEEDS TO ISSUER 
We
estimate that, at a per share price of $2 the net proceeds from the sale of the
10,000,000 shares in this Offering will be approximately $19,970,000 after
deducting the estimated offering expenses of approximately $30,000. 
The
net proceeds of this Offering will be used in four key areas: (i) Cash payment
for Mael assets (ii) equipping the manufacturing operation (the assembly line);
(iii) hiring key members of the management team; (iv) continuing development of
the 6 and 10 seats turboprop aircrafts; and (v) development of the
manufacturing facility.
Accordingly,
we expect to use the net proceeds, estimated as discussed above, as follows, if
we raise the maximum offering amount:

_________________ 
(1) A portion of working capital will be used for officers’ salaries. 
Because
the Offering is being made on a “best-efforts” basis, without a minimum
offering amount, we may close the Offering without sufficient funds for all the
intended proceeds set out above. 
If
only the Minimum Offering of 2,500,000.00 shares is sold, the net proceeds will
be approximately $4,970,000 after deducting estimated offering expenses of
$30,000. In the event of an Offering of that size, we expect to use the net
proceeds as follows: Approximately $3,000,000 to pay for the assets,
approximately $1,000,000 for the manufacturing facility and approximately $1,000,000
for working capital.
We
estimate the total project will cost approximately $20 million. We require
minimum of $5 million to fund the operation. We require $5 million cash payment
to Mael aircraft shareholders; we need working capital to fund the assembly
line/manufacturing facility, and capital to be able to commence operation.
This
is a preliminary estimate based primarily upon the project investment
requirement as well as our operational costs for the next three years. We
intend to raise a minimum of $5 million and a maximum of $20 million of equity
through this offering.                    
The
foregoing information is an estimate based on our current business plan. We may
find it necessary or advisable to re-allocate portions of the net proceeds
reserved for one category or another, and we will have broad discretion in
doing so. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
Offering in short-term, interest-bearing securities. 
The company
reserves the right to change the above use of proceeds if management believes
it is in the best interests of the company.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
Background

We
were a Delaware corporation organized on September 15, 2016 as TAHAWI Aerospace
Corp Our business office address is 205 D Chubb Ave, Suite 240, Lyndhurst, NJ
07071 USA. Our telephone number is 646-694-0051.   TAHAWI Aerospace Corp began
operations in 2016. TAHAWI Aerospace is acquiring the assets of Mael Aircraft
and will close on the assets upon a successful offering, the assets has one FAA
Type A Certificate (Type A Certificate number A6SO BA-42) having modifications
for two variations of prototype airplanes: a four passenger, twin-engine
aircraft and a six passenger, twin-engine aircraft. Both certificates and
prototype aircraft are included in the sale along with a partially assembled
plane in the construction jig, a static plane model used to superimpose load
factors for stress and structure, all dies, jigs and molds utilized to
fabricate the airplane parts, enough formed parts for 1-3 aircraft frames and
all available raw materials. In addition, all intellectual property rights and
patents associated with the aircraft as well as all available blueprints,
designs, catalog and card files and books used to construct the aircraft are also
included in the sale. Originally these aircraft were part of a Sam
Burns/Mississippi State University study to develop lightweight fuel-efficient
passenger planes that could be converted to jets in the 1970s. Both aircraft
feature twin reciprocating engines utilizing semi-monologue, an all-aluminum
basic frame structure with fiberglass nose, tail, wing tips, fairings, &
cowls. As well as a circular fuselage at mid-wing and a tail in a low drag
design that has an aerodynamically smooth construction. Also, a cabin
air-operated stairway entrance opens into a depressed center walkway. The
tricycle landing gear is hydraulically operated as well as fully retractable.
Electrically operated flaps are slotted with a long lip and large radius. This
FAA Type Certificate is "immediate production" ready and reflects
several years' worth of extensive engineering and investment by NASA. TAHAWI
analyzed the market for the four and six passages and limited cargo aircrafts.
TAHAWI’s analysis determined that existing aircraft are highly priced and fuel
inefficient. TAHAWI believes that offering a product that is 30% cheaper and
cost effective in this niche markets. 
 
We
are a startup development stage company that has yet to commence operations. We
presently have no revenues, do not expect to generate any revenue until we
begin operating the plant and may never become profitable.   
The
asset value
:   All productive assets and equipment are sold and after reviewing similar
companies and their initial startup costs and expenses, management  
estimates   the   value   of   assets   to be $100,000,000.

Our Vision 
TAHAWI
Aerospace Corp is seeking to manufacture the FAA certified twin-engine
aircraft. The design was originally conceived by a collaboration of NASA and
the University of Mississippi in the late seventies.  Unlike many of today's
consumer commodities aircraft design is completely independent in many aspects.
The aerospace industry is using designs and features in the NASA shuttle
programs that were conceived in the late sixties. In modern aviation, many of
Boeing's designs from the sixties and seventies are still in use today.
The
B-52 serves as a tremendous example, on January 22, 2002 FORTUNE Magazine
reported the following:
 "The war in Afghanistan is
the most high tech in history. But among all the cutting-edge munitions, you
can still find a half-century-old military staple. For five decades, the
workhorse of the U.S. Air Force has remained the B-52 bomber; one of the
oldest-it celebrated its 501h birthday last November-and the most reliable
machines still active in our nation's defense. What's more, the eight-engine
behemoth is slated to stay in service for at least another four decades. No one
expected that kind of longevity. The B-52 was conceived at the end of World War
II as an "interim bomber," a gigantic prop plane (not even a jet!)
that would soon be replaced by the fancier B-70. Six Boeing engineers threw its
final architecture together during a single weekend in 1947 at the Van Cleve
Hotel in Dayton. Since it was designed before computers removed all the guesswork 
(indeed, before transistors were invented) , the B-52 was built so strong and
with so many redundant systems that  it has been able to accommodate every
alteration the Air force has demanded of it.  The first prototype rolled out of
a Seattle factory on Nov. 29, 1951."
The
same can be said for the aircraft manufactured by TAHAWI Aerospace, which are
designed and built to be durable yet effective. The airframe is rigid but not
cumbersome, without sacrificing its ability to carry load. Several aircraft
brokers have reviewed the aircraft and all have come to the same conclusion:
the design is versatile and effective with many potential applications. Two
working models were made, although never mass-produced. The design was well
ahead of its time and the features incorporated into the aircraft will make it
a strong contender in today's marketplace.
The
aircraft's design was made with the general aviation passenger use in mind,
employing a high T-tail and rear entry doorway. Many aircraft companies have
turned their attention to developing small jets. These jets are attractive but
have severe limitations with weight limits and fuel consumption. TAHAWI’s
aircraft are economical to operate in any country and the aircraft is easy to
maintain. The aircraft offers a more economical solution for corporate
executives, passenger services, and cargo carriers. A combination of the
aircraft's features, economic flexibility, and readily available part supply
makes the design internationally attractive.
The
design is very adaptable to several operational needs. The aircraft can be used
to carry passengers in the general aviation market or alternatively carry
cargo. TAHAWI's aircraft can carry an effective load a greater distance than
most of its available competition in today's aviation marketplace. The aircraft
has the ability to land and takeoff on short and dirt runways while carrying
cargo or passengers, making it a powerful tool in remote locations as well as
large hubs. These attributes amount to a tool that is attractive to
international buyers around the globe.

MISSION
STATEMENT
TAHAWI
Aerospace aims to offer high quality, low maintenance aircraft that will meet
the demands of rapidly growing freight operations and general aviation. The
consumer will have the ability to attain a commercially applicable and state of
the art aircraft while still remaining cost effective.
TAHAWI’s
Aerospace will compete with other premium-quality commercial aircraft
manufacturers in the market. TAHAWI management believes there is an opportunity
within a currently untapped market due to: many current providers being too
diversified to serve the increasingly specialized needs of both commercial and
general aviation industry segments, as well as additional providers having
focused their efforts and money into their stake in the small and inefficient
private jet market. TAHAWI has a well-designed and FAA-certified aircraft with
diverse applications which will be optimal in slotting into a void left by the
current market. 
Value Proposition

ABOUT THE
PRODUCT
TAHAWI
Aircraft has a certified A type certificate for a six passenger aircraft. The
aircraft’s notable characteristics include: a design that is compatible to an
increase in size from 6 to 10 passengers, a cruising speed beyond 200 mph at
75% power, 1750 lbs. useful load capacity, a comfortable cabin at 11 foot long
and 4 foot 6 inches wide. In comparison to the Seneca V, the TAHAWI: has an
additional useful load of 400 lbs, larger cabin size, superior range, the
ability to take off and land on shorter runways, faster cruising speed.
TAHAWI’s aircraft is designed for high lift and low drag; pilots that have
flown the TAHAWI have stated the aircraft’s forgiving nature. It is designed to
be easy to fly and for great fuel economy.
TAHAWI
has three separate designs that can be built.  TAHAWI has the option to
subcontract or manufacture in house the first design, a twin engine, 210 HP
Continental power plant, with two blades. This version will cruise at 200 MPH
and has the FAA requirements. The design will is certified by the FAA and
should be available for delivery in six calendar months. 
A
newer facility will be needed to produce the aircraft on a larger scale. The
second version will have additional horsepower and three blades. This will add
extra power for quicker take-off on shorter runways, and will increase the
overall speed and performance. The extra wing tip fuel tanks will add an
additional 35 gallons of fuel and provide extended range while utilizing the
same version. 
TAHAWI
Aerospace will conduct research and development into the two later versions as
work progresses on the first model. To adhere to these timelines, TAHAWI
proposes to open a new manufacturing facility, and aviation part distribution
center in Mississippi. 
The
company will start an on-site service and repair facility, along with a
flight-training program to ensure that our customers are familiar with the safe
flight operations of the aircraft. TAHAWI will compile a strategic team of:
engineers, technicians, consultants, manufacturing fabricators, aviation part
suppliers, and other professionals in the Mississippi area.
 
 
 
 
 

15
 
 

 
Marketing Strategy
 
TAHAWI's
marketing strategy will include the use of targeted print media advertising,
social media, and direct sales to exporters in the United States and abroad to
who provide aircraft to the international markets.  We will capitalize on
relationships with aircraft brokers who have communicated their willingness to
recommend TAHAWI's aircraft to domestic affiliates.  We are positioned as a
differentiated provider of the highest quality aircraft in today’s marketplace.
The primary goal of all marketing efforts will be to communicate this position
to existing and potential customers.
 
Management



TAHAWI
is guided by a leadership team with decades of Mael chief engineer experience. Our
team possesses a deep well of expertise in fixed wing and vertical takeoff/landing
aircraft, as well as a successful track record of bringing new aircraft to
market. TAHAWI has assembled a management team that includes aviation industry
executives and professionals with decades of experience. Mr. Son Bryant, the
original chief engineer that designed the aircraft is currently the COO of
TAHAWI. The company believes that this management team knows what is required
to finance, design, certify, and launch a program of this magnitude. This
management team brings to TAHAWI decades of sound management experience
developing and executing strategic business and aircraft development plans, as
well as technical and financial expertise in enterprises of various scales in
different businesses. 
 
Market
Overview  
 
Aircraft
Shipments and Billings according to “GAMA”
 
In
2015, $28 billion in new general aviation aircraft were delivered, but yearend
results were mixed across the market segments and among the manufacturers.
Results were impacted by economic uncertainty and currency fluctuations in key
general aviation markets, such as Brazil and Europe, as well as in emerging
markets, like China. By contrast, the North American market, in particular the
United States provided stronger delivery numbers, a reason for cautious
optimism. Piston airplane shipments were down in 2015. The piston market has
grown incrementally since 2010, but declined by 6.5% in 2015 compared to 2014,
from 1,129 to 1,056 shipments. Two thirds of piston shipments were to North
American customers, a significant increase from the 2014 North American market
share of 55.1%. The Asia-Pacific market was the second largest at 13.5%; Europe
accounted for 11.4% of shipments. Piston rotorcraft shipments increased in 2015
by 8.6% from 2014. During the year, the rotorcraft industry delivered 279
piston aircraft. The delivery of turboprop airplanes also declined, from 603
units in 2014 to 557 units in 2015. The North American market accounted for
56.2% of deliveries, an increase from 51.3% the previous year. Turboprop
shipment numbers remain strong in both the Asia-Pacific region at 16.3% and in
Latin America at 14.5%. By contrast, Europe saw its smallest market share for
turboprop deliveries since GAMA started tracking regional shipment data in
2007: 6.6%. The Middle East and Africa accounted for 6.3% of the market. The
preliminary turbine (*) results for rotorcraft industry point to a decline in
civil shipments from 741 in 2014 to 675 in 2015, an 8.9% decline. Business jet
shipments were mostly flat in 2015 compared to 2014. The industry shipped 718
business jets in 2015 compared to 722 the year before. The industry’s continued
investment in new products helped maintain the delivery rate for business jets.

 
Turbine
Aircraft Operators
 
The
worldwide business aircraft fleet continued to grow in 2015. According to
JETNET, LLC, at the end of 2015, the turbine fleet consisted of 35,682
airplanes and 20,853 rotorcraft. There was an additional 9,682 piston
rotorcraft in operation. The number of active operators is also growing: At the
end of 2015, there were 21,339 business aircraft operators and 14,147
rotorcraft operators in operation. After several years of decline, the
fractional aircraft fleet has stabilized. According to
JETNET, LLC, in 2015, there were 837 aircraft used in fractional operations, up
from 823 in 2014, and the number of fractional owners was 4,369, a slight
decline from 2014, when there were 4,402 owners.

Market Drivers 
The recession
from December 2007 to June 2009 had a massive impact on the general aviation
(GA) aircraft manufacturing industry. In 2010, however, the downward trend
stopped and the number of aircraft sold increased by 4.8% worldwide from 2,023
in 2010 to 2,120 in 2011. Shipments of aircraft manufactured in the U.S.
increased 3.6% from 1,465 in 2011 to 1,518 in 2012. In 2014, worldwide
production increased to 2,454 aircraft (up 4.3%), while the U.S. output grew to
1,631 aircraft (up 1.0%). In 2015, worldwide production declined to 2,331
aircraft (down 5.0%), while the U.S. output was 1,592 aircraft (down 2.4%).

Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) data. Commentary and analysis by

Due
to the fallout of the financial crisis and the 2007-2009 recession, sales of
business jets and piston-engine aircraft collapsed and are, as of 2016, not
even close to their 2007 peak levels. From 2007-2010, the global production of
GA aircraft dropped a staggering 52.8% from 4,276 aircraft in 2007 to 2,020 in
2010. In the United States, manufacturers experienced a 59.3% drop in
production from 3,279 to 1,334 units.
 
An
important reason why deliveries of general aviation aircraft are still way
below their 2007 peak levels, both worldwide and in the U.S., is that the price
per aircraft has doubled. From 2007 to 2015, the average price of a
piston-engine aircraft which is the most common type, has soared from $328,000
in 2007 to 609,000 today. That increase is keeping thousands of would be buyers
out of the market. Also, the average price of a business jet is up from $12.5
million to $26.3 million over the same period. At the same time, the average
price of turboprops has declined from $3.5 million to $3.1 million, resulting
in a surge in sales of this type of aircraft.

Revenue from General Aviation
Aircraft Delivered
General
aviation (GA) aircraft manufacturers have experienced a relatively modest drop
in revenues relative to the massive drop in units shipped.
 
From
2008-2012, revenues from the worldwide production of GA aircraft decreased
23.7% from $24.77 billion to $18.89 billion. In the United States,
manufacturers experienced a much larger 39.9% drop in revenues from $13.35
billion in 2008 to $8.02 billion in 2012. In 2013, revenues soared both in the
U.S. (+38.1%) and worldwide (+24.1%). In 2015, revenues were down worldwide
(-1.6%) but up in the U.S. (+2.4%).

Relative
to the major decrease in shipments, revenues are almost back at pre-financial
crisis levels. Manufacturers in the U.S. have more than doubled the unit price
of business jets since 2008. Between 2008 and 2013, prices went up a staggering
133% on average. This is discussed in the chart following below.
 
Business
jets make up the vast majority of U.S. and worldwide sales revenues, accounting
for 85% and 91% of 2015 sales, respectively. Piston-engine aircraft account for
only 2% of worldwide revenues and 4% in the U.S.
 
Average
GA Aircraft Price - U.S. and Global
 
General
aviation (GA) aircraft manufacturers have raised their prices dramatically to
make up for declining sales volumes. Clearly manufacturers are aware that, at
low levels of demand, a private aircraft is a very price inelastic type of
product - thus prices can be raised without demand falling nearly as much.

18
 
 

 

From
2007-2010, the average price of a GA aircraft (worldwide) almost doubled from
$5.1 million to $9.8 million (+91%). U.S. manufacturers also raised their
prices, although by "only" 64% ($3.6 million in 2007 to $5.9 million
in 2010).
 
Prices
went up every year from 2003/2004 - peaking in 2010. In 2011, worldwide general
aviation aircraft prices dropped 8.0% followed by a 1.5% decrease in 2012. In
2015, the average aircraft price was $10.3 million - up 3.6% from 2014).
 
Global
GA Aircraft Deliveries by Type of Aircraft
 
Piston-engine aircraft are the most frequently sold
general aviation aircraft worldwide followed by business jets and turboprops.
In 2015, of the 2,331 aircraft delivered worldwide, 1,056 (45%) were
piston-powered, 718 (31%) were jets, and 557 (24%) were turboprops. In 2014, of
the 2,454 aircraft delivered worldwide, 1,129 (46%) were piston- 
In
2015, shipments of all types of general aviation aircraft declined. Business
jet deliveries decreased the least (-0.6%), while turboprops and piston-engine
aircraft were off 7.6 and 6.5%, respectively.

U.S.
GA Aircraft Deliveries by Type of Aircraft
 
In
the United States, piston-engine aircraft deliveries surpass shipments of jets
and turboprops. In 2015, out of 1,592 aircraft delivered, 783 (49%) were
piston-powered, 389 (24%) were jets, and 420 (26%) were turboprops. In 2014,
out of 1,631 aircraft delivered, 788 (48%) were piston-powered, 375 (23%) were
jets, and 468 (29%) were turboprops.
In
2011, shipments of turboprop aircraft soared 76.3%. A new industry trend also
emerged as the sale of turboprop aircraft for the first time surpassed the sale
of business jets. However, in 2014 and 2015, sales of turboprop aircraft
declined by 11.2% and 10.3%, respectively.
In
2015, business jet shipments were up 3.7%, while piston-engine aircraft
deliveries decreased 0.6%.

General Aviation Aircraft Exports
 
From
2008 to 2011, U.S. general aviation aircraft exports fell dramatically from
1,161 to 486 aircraft equal to a 58.1% drop.
 
In
2012, exports jumped to 720 aircraft (+48.1%), regaining the terrain lost in
2011.

It
is difficult to forecast any projection based to an existing aircraft
manufacturer and historical sales levels of similar aircraft because we don’t
have a history of production. In order to estimate the number of aircraft we
believe we can sell each year, we conducted a market
analysis based on the performance characteristics relative to existing
alternatives. 

23
 
 

 
 
To
conduct the analysis, we identified the likely objections that buyers of a
particular type of aircraft would have when considering the purchase of our
four and six passenger’s aircrafts. We then estimated what percentage of those
buyer segments would object to our type of aircrafts because of each of the
considerations (i.e., those that would object because it could not seat enough
passengers or because it could not fly a long enough distance, etc.). 
 
This
resulted in a percentage of each buyer segment that would not object to our
four and six passenger’s aircraft relative to aircraft in that class, leaving
the expected portion of each market that we could capture. 
With
the potential share for each market estimated, we then analyzed market forecast
data from “GAMA”, an industry leading market data organization. This data
identified the number of units, by type of aircraft, which are sold over the
years. Applying the market share of each aircraft type we expect to capture to
the number of aircraft expected to be delivered in each category per year, we
estimated that we can expect to sell between 25 – 35 aircraft each year. This
analysis only considered sales to civilian users, and does not include military
or commercial use forecasts. 
 
After
completing our internal analysis, our management team, board of directors,
aviation marketing companies and other industry participants all reviewed those
findings and provided input as to the reasonableness of the company’ conclusion
or expectation of selling 25-35 of our four and six passenger’s aircraft each
year. Based on the totality of the data and those conversations, we feel that
this estimate is achievable. However, for the purpose of creating our business
plan, we have assumed a lower more conservative number of annual aircraft
deliveries. 
 
Production
Plan and Suppliers 


TAHAWI
intends to use a horizontally integrated manufacturing strategy whereby the
company maintains control of all planning, design and final assembly aspects of
the process, but outsources some of the manufacturing components (i.e.,
engines, transmission, avionics, landing gear, etc.). TAHAWI has FAA approved
certificate to manufacture the entire aircraft. 
 
We
intend to utilize the professional networks of our executive team, gained from
decades of experience in the industry, to secure favorable supply agreements
with leading manufactures. These suppliers will design and fabricate components
to TAHAWI’s design specifications for incorporation into a final product. The
majority of these components will be largely off-the-shelf systems used in
other aircraft, with only limited customization or design features that are
specifically required for our aircrafts.  
Employees
and Consultants 

The
company has the expertise of the original chief engineer whom he designed Mael
aircraft Mr. Son Bryant, he is currently the COO and Chief engineer of TAHAWI Aerospace.
The company intends to hire a number of employees after the Offering primarily
to support our engineering, manufacturing and development efforts. 
 
Aviation
Regulations 

In
the U.S., civil aviation is regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration
(the “FAA”), which controls virtually every aspect of flight from pilot
licensing to aircraft design and construction. The FAA requires that every
civilian aircraft that flies in the U.S. must carry a valid type certificate
and airworthiness certificate issued by the FAA or a foreign civil aviation
authority. 
 
The
company currently has one FAA Type Certificate with modifications for two
variations of prototype airplanes, one for four passengers, twin-engine aircraft
and the other for- six passengers, twin-engine aircraft. The company will seek to obtain approval for the design of 6 and 10
passenger turboprops under the Federal Aviation Regulations. The FAA will
conduct extensive testing and analysis of the company’s new design to determine
the safety, stability, reliability and performance of the aircraft and that the
aircraft complies with the applicable airworthiness standards. 

24
 
 

 
The
FAA also issues standard airworthiness certificates to each aircraft that is
manufactured in accordance with an approved design or type certificate. Rather
than test each aircraft that is built, the FAA allows manufacturers to prove
that their manufacturing process and quality control system produces conforming
aircraft each time. Only a company that owns a type certificate is entitled to
this authorization, called a production certificate. If the FAA approves of
TAHAWI’s manufacturing process, the company will be issued a production
certificate and each aircraft manufactured by TAHAWI in accordance with the
type certificate will receive an airworthiness certificate. 
Intellectual
Property


The
Company’s intellectual property includes the FAA (A Type Certificate number
A6SO - BA-42), blueprint, the acquired NASA study, design and trade secrets.
The FAA certification in considered intellectual property in the aviation
space, employee and third-party consultants have signed non-disclosure
agreements with the company to further protect its proprietary rights. The
company will apply for a patent to cover various proprietary designs in the
future. 
 
Litigation 
 
The
company is not involved in any litigation, and its management is not aware of
any pending or threatened legal actions relating to its intellectual property,
conduct of its business activities, or otherwise.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

TAHAWI
Aerospace Corp began operations in September of 2016. TAHAWI Aerospace is
acquiring the assets of Mael Aircraft and will close on the assets upon a
successful offering:  MAEL AIRCRAFT assets consist of one FAA Type A
Certificate (A Type Certificate number A6SO - BA-42) with modifications for two
variations of prototype airplanes, one for four passenger, twin-engine aircraft
and the other for- six passenger, twin-engine aircraft. Both certificate and
prototype aircraft and a partially assembled aircraft in the construction jig,
a static plane model used to superimpose load factors for stress and structure,
all dies, jigs and molds utilized to fabricate the airplane parts, enough
formed parts for 1-3 aircraft frames and all available raw materials. In
addition, all intellectual property rights and patents associated with the
aircraft as well as all available blueprints, designs, catalog and card files
and books used to construct the aircraft are also included in the sale.
Originally these aircraft were part of a Sam Burns/Mississippi State University
study to develop lightweight fuel-efficient passenger planes that could be
converted to jets in the 1970s. Both aircraft feature twin reciprocating
engines utilizing semi-monologue, an all-aluminum basic frame structure with
fiberglass nose, tail, wing tips, fairings and cowls, a circular fuselage at
mid-wing and a tail in a low drag design that is aerodynamically smooth
construction. Also, a cabin air-operated stairway entrance opens into a
depressed center walkway. The tricycle landing gear is hydraulically operated as
well as fully retractable. Electrically operated flaps are slotted with a long
lip and large radius. This FAA Type Certificate is "immediate
production" ready and reflects several years' worth of extensive
engineering and investment by NASA. TAHAWI analyzed the market for the four,
six and the 10 passages aircrafts and the limited cargo aircrafts. It
determined that existing aircraft are highly priced and not fuel efficient.
TAHAWI believes that offering a product that 30% cheaper and cost effective in this
niche markets is highly needed.
TAHAWI
Aerospace Corp is seeking to initially manufacture the two variations of its
FAA certified prototype propeller aircrafts, one for four passengers,
twin-engine aircraft and the other for- six passengers, twin-engine aircraft.
The design was originally conceived by a collaboration of NASA and the
University of Mississippi in the late seventies.  Unlike many of today's
consumer commodities aircraft design is completely different in many aspects.
The aerospace industry is using designs and features in the NASA shuttle
programs that were conceived in the late 60's. In aviation, many of the designs
of Boeing from the 60's and 70's are in use today. The company will seek to
obtain approval for the design of six and ten passenger turboprop aircraft
under the Federal Aviation Regulations. The FAA will conduct extensive testing
and analysis of the company’s new design to determine the safety, stability,
reliability and performance of the aircraft and that the aircraft complies with
the applicable airworthiness standards. 
 
One
only has to look at the B-52. FORTUNE Magazine January 22, 2002, reported the
following­ "The war in Afghanistan is the most high tech in history. But
among all the cutting-edge munitions, you can still find a half-century-old
military staple. For five decades, the workhorse of the U.S. Air Force has
remained the B-52 bomber; one of the oldest-it celebrated its 501h birthday
last November-and the most reliable machines still active in our nation's
defense. What's more, the eight-engine behemoth is slated to stay in service
for at least another four decades. No one expected that kind of longevity. The
B-52 was conceived at the end of World War II as an "interim bomber,"
a gigantic prop plane (not even a jet!) that would soon be replaced by the
(fancier B-70. Six Boeing engineers threw its final architecture together
during a single weekend in 1947 at the Van Cleve Hotel in Dayton. Since it was
designed before computers removed all the guesswork  (indeed, before
transistors were invented) , the B-52 was built so strong and with so many
redundant systems that  it has been able to accommodate every alteration the
Air force has demanded of it.  The first prototype rolled out of a Seattle
factory on Nov. 29, 1951."
 
The
same can be said for the TAHAWI aerospace aircrafts. It is strong and the
airframe was designed to last. The construction of airframe is solid and the
gross weight and lifting ability is remarkable. Several aircraft brokers have reviewed the aircraft and have all admitted the same
conclusions; this is a versatile and useful design that has many applications.
Two working models were made and never mass-produced. The design was well ahead
of its time and the features incorporated into the airplane will make it a
strong contender in today's marketplace.

27
 
 

 
 
The
aircraft has a high T tail and a rear entry doorway. The design was for general
aviation passenger use. Many aircraft companies have turned their attention to
developing small jets. These jets are attractive but have severe limitations
with weight limits and fuel consumption. The TAHAWI’s are economical to operate
in any country and the aircraft is easy to maintain. Parts are readably
available and these features make this design an international attraction. The
airplane offers a more economical solution for corporate executives, passenger
services, and cargo carriers.
 
The
design is very adaptable to several operational needs. The airplane can be used
as a passenger aircraft in the General Aviation market or as a cargo aircraft.
TAHAWI's airplane can carry a useful load a greater distance than most of its
competition available in today's aviation marketplace. The airplane can utilize
very remote airports with dirt or short runways and transport equipment and/or
passengers into larger hubs.  Internationally, these features will make these
aircraft very attractive to potential buyers.
 
TAHAWI
aerospace aims to offer high quality, low maintenance aircraft that will meet
the requirements of a rapidly growing demand for freight operations and General
Aviation. The consumer will have the ability to have a state of the art
aircraft with commercial applications at a cost effective price.
 
TAHAWI’s
will compete with other premium-quality commercial aircraft manufacturers in
the market. The management of TAHAWI’s believes there is a current untapped
market opportunity because 1) existing providers of aircraft are too
diversified to serve the increasingly specialized needs of the commercial and
general aviation industry segments. 2) The other competitors have focused their
energy and money in developing the small and inefficient private jet market,
and 3) TAHAWI’s has a (well designed and certified aircraft with various uses.

 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources
 
As of September
30, 2016, the Company had $5000 in cash and total liabilities of
$30,000. As of November 30, 2016, the Company has incurred total
expenses since inception of $30,000 related to the Reg A filing expenses
associated with this Offering.  We
are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operation. The
Company hopes to raise $20,000,000 in this Offering. If we are successful
at raising the maximum amount of this offering, we believe that such funds will
be sufficient to fund our project over the next three years, and achieve
significant growth.
Although
we planning a major marketing and development approach, there is no guarantee
that we will be successful. Our plan will depend highly on our funds, the
availability of those funds, and the success of our implementation. Upon the
qualification of the Form 1-A, the Company plans to pursue the
implementation of our manufacturing plan. There can be no assurance of the
Company's ability to do so or that additional capital will be available
to the Company. If so, the Company's investment objective of the
manufacturing plan will be adversely affected and the Company may not
be able to pursue its goals if it is unable to finance such plan. The
Company currently has no agreements, arrangements or understandings with
any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other
sources. Since the Company has no such arrangements or plans
currently in effect, its inability to raise funds for the above purposes will
have a severe negative impact on its ability to implement its plan. There can
be no assurance that additional capital will be available to the Company.
If we are successful at raising capital by issuing more stock, or securities
which are convertible into shares of the Company, your investment will be
diluted as a result of such issuance.
 

28
 
 

 
We are dependent upon the success
of this offering to achieve our planned project, as described herein.
Therefore, the failure thereof would result in the need to seek capital from
other resources such as taking loans, which would likely not even be possible
for the Company. However, if such financing were available, because we are a
development stage company with no operation to date, we would likely have to
pay additional costs associated with loans and be subject to an above market
interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate
the terms of such debt financing. If the Company cannot raise additional
proceeds via a private placement of its equity or debt securities, or secure a
loan, the Company would be required to scale back its rapid growth plan. 
 
Plan
of Operations 


The
company has developed a detailed plan to complete its preliminary manufacturing
phase, hire key members of its management team, expand sales and marketing
efforts and complete detailed design and development work to support the
production of the flying six and four passengers’ propeller aircrafts. Under
the current FAA certification we are able to enter into production immediately
if we are successful in raising capital in this offering; our 6 and 10
passenger turboprop is expected to take approximately 2 to 3 years to be
certified by the FAA and produce. The exact time and cost to secure FAA
certification and commence production is not known, but we estimate that it
will take 2 to 3 years and require at least $5 million in additional funding
after completion of the proof of concept. We are now seeking $20 million in
funding from this Regulation A Offering to fund our 3 year plan to produce the
current FAA certified 4 and 6 passengers propeller aircrafts, and   the 6 and
10 passenger turboprops after certification by the FAA.  
 
Upon
completion of this Offering, the company will focus its resources in four key
areas: : (i) cash payment for Mael Assets Acquisition (ii) equipping the
manufacturing operation (the assembly line); (iii) hiring key members of the
management team; (iv) continuing development of the 6 and 10 seats turboprop
aircrafts; and (v) development of the manufacturing facility.
We will develop
an internal and external sales and marketing capability to increase awareness
of the aircraft and position the company to begin taking refundable customer
deposits and pre-sales orders. This will be accomplished with the following
milestones: 



 


- 


Will
  initiate our sales and marketing efforts 




 


- 


Build
  our 4 and 6 passengers propeller aircrafts 




 


- 


Attend
  and exhibit at one major international trade show 




 


- 


Receive
  nonrefundable, deposit orders for the 4 and 6 passengers propeller aircrafts



We believe that increasing
awareness of the aircraft and demonstrating customer demand through orders will
enable the company to raise additional capital in the future more easily. The
company will be able to use the nonrefundable deposits to produce the currently
certified 4 and 6 passengers’ propeller aircrafts.
The
milestones identified above assume that we are able to raise the full $20
million from this Offering. In that event, the company would expect to
accomplish all of the above milestones within the first 12 months. However, we
have developed our spending plans in each of these areas to be scalable to the
amount of money that we raise in this Offering. As a result, we do not anticipate
needing to raise additional funds in the 3 years after the completion of this
Offering.

Note 1.    
Organization, History and Business 
 
TAHAWI
Aerospace Corp began operations in 2016, TAHAWI Aerospace is acquiring the
assets of Mael Aircraft and will close on the assets upon a successful offering: 
MAEL AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING COMPANY assets consist of one FAA Type A (A Type
Certificate number A6SO - BA-42) with modifications for 2 variations of
prototype airplanes, one for four passenger, twin-engine aircraft and the other
for- six passenger, twin-engine aircraft. Both certificate and prototype
aircraft are included in the sale along with a partially assembled plane in the
construction jig, a static plane model used to superimpose load factors for
stress and structure, all dies, jigs and molds utilized to fabricate the
airplane parts, enough formed parts for 1-3 aircraft frames and all available
raw materials. In addition, all intellectual property rights and patents
associated with the aircraft as well as all available blueprints, designs,
catalog and card files and books used to construct the aircraft are also
included in the sale. Originally these aircraft were part of a Sam Burns/Mississippi
State University study to develop lightweight fuel-efficient passenger planes
that could be converted to jets in the 1970s. Both aircraft feature twin
reciprocating engines utilizing semi-monologue, an all-aluminum basic frame
structure with fiberglass nose, tail, wing tips, fairings and cowls, a circular
fuselage at mid-wing and a tail in a low drag design that is aerodynamically
smooth construction. Also, a cabin air-operated stairway entrance opens into a
depressed center walkway. The tricycle landing gear is
hydraulically operated as well as fully retractable. Electrically operated
flaps are slotted with a long lip and large radius. This FAA Type Certificate
is "immediate production" ready and reflects several years' worth of
extensive engineering and investment by NASA. TAHAWI analyzed the market for
the four and six passages and limited cargo aircrafts. It determined that
existing aircraft are highly priced and not fuel efficient. TAHAWI believes
that offering a product that 30% cheaper and cost effective in this niche
markets is highly needed.

40
 
 

 
 
TAHAWI
Aerospace is seeking to initially manufacture the two variations of its FAA
certified prototype propeller aircrafts, one for four passengers, twin-engine
aircraft and the other for- six passengers, twin-engine aircraft.
 
Note
2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  
Revenue
Recognition 
 
Revenue
is derived from contracts with our consumers. Revenue is recognized in
accordance with ASC 605. As such, the Company identifies performance obligations
and recognizes revenue over the period through which the Company satisfies
these obligations. Any contracts that by nature cannot be broken down by
specific performance criteria will recognize revenue on a straight-line basis
over the contractual term of period of the contract.
 
Accounts
Receivable 
 
Accounts
receivable is reported at the customers’ outstanding balances, less any
allowance for doubtful accounts.  Interest is not accrued on overdue
accounts receivable.
 
Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts 
 
An
allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable is charged to operations
in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for uncollectible accounts at a
level management believes is adequate to cover any probable
losses.  Management determines the adequacy of the allowance based on
historical write-off percentages and information collected from individual
customers.  Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance
when collectability is determined to be permanently impaired.
 

Stock
Based Compensation 
 
When
applicable, the Company will account for stock-based payments to employees in
accordance with ASC 718, “Stock Compensation” (“ASC
718”).  Stock-based payments to employees include grants of stock,
grants of stock options and issuance of warrants that are recognized in the
consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of
grant.
 
The
Company accounts for stock-based payments to non-employees in accordance with
ASC 505-50, “Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.”  Stock-based
payments to non-employees include grants of stock, grants of stock options and
issuances of warrants that are recognized in the consolidated statement of
operations based on the value of the vested portion of the award over the
requisite service period as measured at its then-current fair value as of each
financial reporting date.
 
The Company calculates the fair value of
option grants and warrant issuances utilizing the Binomial pricing
model.  The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a
period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately
expected to vest.  ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at
the time stock options are granted and warrants are issued to employees and
non-employees, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates.  The term “forfeitures” is
distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested
portion of the surrendered stock option or warrant.  The Company
estimates forfeiture rates for all unvested awards when calculating the expense
for the period.  In estimating the
forfeiture rate, the Company monitors both stock option and warrant exercises
as well as employee termination patterns.  The resulting stock-based
compensation expense for both employee and non-employee awards is generally recognized
on a straight-line basis over the period in which the Company expects to
receive the benefit, which is generally the vesting period.

41
 
 

 
 
Loss
per Share 
 
The
Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260-10, "Earnings
per Share." Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by
dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is
computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator
is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have
been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the
additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted earnings (loss) per share have
not been presented since there are no dilutive securities.
 
Cash
and Cash Equivalents 
 
For
purpose of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers cash and cash
equivalents to include all stable, highly liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less.
 
Concentration
of Credit Risk 
 
The
Company primarily transacts its business with one financial institution. The
amount on deposit in that one institution may from time to time exceed the
federally-insured limit.
  
Use
of Estimates 
 
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Business
segments 
 
ASC
280, “Segment Reporting” requires use of the “management approach”
model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way
a company’s management organizes segments within the company for making
operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company determined it has
one operating segment as of November 30, 2016.
 
Income
Taxes 
 
The
Company accounts for its income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740,
“Income Taxes.” The method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740
is an asset and liability method. The asset and
 
Note
2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(continued) 
  
liability
method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
expected future tax
consequences
of temporary differences between tax bases and financial reporting bases of
other assets and liabilities.
 
 
 
 

42
 
 

 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
The
Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine
their applicability to the Company. Where it is determined that a new
accounting pronouncement affects the Company’s financial reporting, the Company
undertakes a study to determine the consequence of the change to its financial
statements and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain
that the Company’s financials properly reflect the change. The Company
currently does not have any recent accounting pronouncements that they are
studying and feel may be applicable.
 
Note
3.     Income Taxes 
 
Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in
taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates
applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense
is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during
the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
 
The
effective tax rate on the net loss before income taxes differs from the U.S.
statutory rate as follows:

Note
3.     Income Taxes (Continued) 
 
The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, formerly FIN 48, and
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”. The Company had no material
unrecognized income tax assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2016.
 
The
Company’s policy regarding income tax interest and penalties is to expense
those items as general and administrative expense but to identify them for tax
purposes. During the period September 30, 2016 through September 30, 2016,
there was no income tax, or related interest and penalty items in the income
statement, or liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company files income tax
returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and Nevada state jurisdiction. We are
not currently involved in any income tax examinations.

Note
8.    Going Concern 
 
The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a
going concern. Currently, the Company has no operating history and has not
generated significant revenue. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management believes that the Company’s
capital requirements will depend on many factors including the success of the
Company’s development efforts and its efforts to raise
capital. Management also believes the Company needs to raise additional capital
for working capital purposes. There is no assurance that such financing will be
available in the future.   The conditions described above raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The
financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and
classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern.

Stockholder who is a natural person, or by such Class B Stockholder's Permitted Entities, shall automatically, without any further action, convert into one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A Common Stock upon the death of such Class B Stockholder; provided, however, that:

(1) If a Founder, or such Founder's Permitted Entity (in either

case, the "Transferring Founder") Transfers exclusive Voting Control (but not ownership) of shares of Class B Common Stock to the other Founder (the "Transferee Founder") which Transfer of Voting Control is contingent or effective upon the death of the Transferring Founder, then each share of Class B Common Stock that is the subject of such Transfer shall automatically convert into one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A Common Stock upon that date which is the earlier of: (a) nine (9) months after the date upon which the Transferring Founder died, or (b) the date upon which the Transferee Founder ceases to hold exclusive Voting Control over such shares of Class B Common Stock; provided, further, that if the Transferee Founder shall die within nine (9) months following the death of the Transferring Founder, then a trustee designated by the Transferee Founder and approved by the Board of Directors may exercise Voting Control over: (x) the
Transferring Founders' shares of Class B Common Stock and, in such instance, each such share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically convert into one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A Common Stock upon that date which is the earlier of: (A) nine (9) months after the date upon which the Transferring Founder died, or (B) the date upon which such trustee ceases to hold exclusive Voting Control over such shares of Class B Common Stock; and (y) the Transferee Founders' shares of Class B Common Stock (or shares held by an entity of the type referred to in paragraph (2) below established by or for the Transferee Founder) and, in such instance, each such share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically convert into one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A Common Stock upon that date which is the earlier of: (A) nine (9) months after the date upon which the Transferee Founder died, or (B) the date upon which such trustee ceases to hold exclusive
Voting Control over such shares of Class B Common Stock; and

(v) The Corporation may, from time to time, establish such policies

and procedures relating to the conversion of the Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock and the general administration of this dual class common stock structure, including the issuance of stock certificates with respect thereto, as it may deem necessary or advisable, and may request that holders of shares of Class B Common Stock furnish affidavits or other proof to the Corporation as it deems necessary to verify the ownership of Class B Common Stock and to confirm that a conversion to Class A Common Stock has not occurred. A determination by the Secretary of the Corporation that a Transfer results in a conversion to Class A Common Stock shall be conclusive.

8

(vi) In the event of a conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock to

shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2, such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the time that the Transfer of such shares occurred. Upon any conversion of Class B Common Stock to Class A Common Stock, all rights of the holder of shares of Class B Common Stock shall cease and the person or persons in whose names or names the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Class A Common Stock are to be issued shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder or holders of such shares of Class A Common Stock. Shares of Class B Common Stock that are converted into shares of Class A Common Stock as provided in this Section 2 shall be retired and may not be reissued.

(g) Reservation of Stock. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep

available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Class B Common Stock, such number of its shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.

       Section 3. Change in Control Transaction. The Corporation shall not consummate a Change in Control Transaction without first obtaining the affirmative vote, at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, of the holders of the greater of:

(A) a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation then entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, and (B) sixty percent (60%) of the voting power of the shares of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the stockholder meeting called to consider the Change in Control Transaction and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.

(a) the sale, encumbrance or disposition (other than non-exclusive licenses in

the ordinary course of business and the grant of security interests in the ordinary course of business) by the Corporation of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets;

(b) the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other

corporation or entity, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or its parent) more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving entity or its parent outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or

(c) the issuance by the Corporation, in a transaction or series of related

transactions, of voting securities representing more than two percent (2%) of the total voting power of the Corporation before such issuance, to any person or persons acting as a group as contemplated in Rule 13d-5(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or any successor provision) such that, following such transaction or related transactions, such person or group of persons would hold more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the Corporation, after giving effect to such issuance.

       Section 4. Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in series, and to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designation, power, preferences, and rights of the shares of each such series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a

class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation filed with respect to any series of Preferred Stock).

      Section 5. Class C Capital Stock. A statement of the designation of the Class C Capital Stock and the powers, preferences and rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof is as follows:

(a) Voting. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, shares of Class C

Capital Stock shall have no voting power and the holders thereof, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any matter that is submitted to a vote or for the consent of the stockholders of the Corporation.

(b) Dividends. Subject to the preferences applicable to any series of Preferred

Stock, if any, outstanding at any time, the holders of Class C Capital Stock shall be entitled to receive, on a per share basis, the same form and amount of dividends and other distributions of cash, property or shares of stock of the Corporation as may be declared by the Board of Directors from time to time with respect to shares of the Common Stock out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor; provided , however, that in the event that such dividend is paid in the form of shares of Common Stock or rights to acquire Common Stock, the holders of Class C Capital Stock shall receive Class C Capital Stock or rights to acquire Class C Capital Stock, as the case may be.

(c) Conversion upon Liquidation. Immediately prior to the earlier of (i) any

distribution of assets of the Corporation to the holders of the Common Stock in connection with a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding up of the Corporation pursuant to Section 2(c) or (ii) any record date established to determine the holders of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution of assets, each outstanding share of the Class C Capital Stock shall automatically, without any further action, convert into and become one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A Common Stock. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Class C Capital Stock pursuant to this Section 5(c), such number of its shares of Class A Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Class C Capital
Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.

(d) Subdivision or Combinations. If the Corporation in any manner

subdivides or combines the outstanding shares of any class of Common Stock, the outstanding

10

shares of the Class C Capital Stock will be subdivided or combined in the same manner. The Corporation shall not subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of the Class C Capital Stock unless a subdivision or combination is made in the same manner with respect to each class of Common Stock.

(e) Equal Status. Except as expressly provided in this Article IV, Class C

Capital Stock shall have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and be identical in all respects to the Common Stock as to all matters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) in the event of a merger, consolidation or other business combination of the Corporation requiring the approval of the holders of the Corporation's capital stock entitled to vote thereon (whether or not the Corporation is the surviving entity), the holders of the Class C Capital Stock shall receive the same amount and form of consideration, if any, on a per share basis as the consideration, if any, received by holders of the Class A Common Stock in connection with such merger, consolidation or combination (provided that if holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to make an election as to the amount or form of consideration such holders shall receive in any such merger, consolidation or combination with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock, the
holders of Class C Capital Stock shall be entitled to make the same election as to their shares of Class C Capital Stock), and (ii) in the event of (x) any tender or exchange offer to acquire any shares of Common Stock by any third party pursuant to an agreement to which the Corporation is a party or (y) any tender or exchange offer by the Corporation to acquire any shares of Common Stock, pursuant to the terms of the applicable tender or exchange offer, the holders of the Class C Capital Stock shall receive the same amount and form of consideration on a per share basis as the holders of the Class A Common Stock (provided that if holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to make an election as to the amount or form of consideration such holders shall receive in any such tender or exchange offer with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock, the holders of Class C Capital Stock shall be entitled to make the same election as to their shares of Class C Capital
Stock).

ARTICLE V

The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.

ARTICLE VI

      Section 1. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon them by statute or by this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation.

       Section 2. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Board of Directors then in office shall be required in order for the Board of Directors to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Corporation's Bylaws.

Notwithstanding the above or any other provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws
of the Corporation may not be

11

amended, altered or repealed except in accordance with Article X of the Bylaws. No Bylaw hereafter legally adopted, amended, altered or repealed shall invalidate any prior act of the directors or officers of the Corporation that would have been valid if such Bylaw had not been adopted, amended, altered or repealed.

Section 3.

(a) If, at any time during which shares of capital stock of the Corporation are

listed for trading on either The Nasdaq National Market ("Nasdaq ") or the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), holders of the requisite voting power under the then-applicable Nasdaq or NYSE listing standards notify the Corporation in writing of their election to cause the Corporation to rely upon the applicable "controlled company" exemptions (the "Controlled Company Exemption") to the corporate governance rules and requirements of the Nasdaq or the NYSE (the "Exchange Governance Rules"), the Corporation shall call a special meeting of the stockholders to consider whether to approve the election to be held within ninety (90) days of written notice of such election (or, if the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders will be held within ninety (90) days of written notice of such election, the Corporation shall include a proposal to the same effect to be considered at such annual meeting). The Corporation shall not elect to rely upon the
Controlled Company Exemption until such time as the Corporation shall have received the approval from holders of at least sixty-six and two thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation at such annual or special meeting.

(b) In the event such approval is obtained, for so long as shares of the capital

stock of the Corporation are listed on either the Nasdaq or the NYSE and the Corporation remains eligible for the Controlled Company Exemption under the requirements of the applicable Exchange Governance Rules, then the Board of Directors shall be constituted such that (i) a majority of the directors on the Board of Directors shall be Outside Directors (as defined below), and (ii) the Corporation's compensation committee and the governance and nominating committee (or such committees serving similar functions as the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall constitute from time to time) shall consist of at least two (2) members of the Board of Directors and shall be composed entirely of Outside Directors. In the event the number of Outside Directors serving on the Board of Directors constitutes less than a majority of the directors on the Board of Directors as a result of the death, resignation or removal of an Outside Director, then the Board of Directors may continue
to properly exercise its powers and no action of the Board of Directors shall be so invalidated, provided, that the Board of Directors shall promptly take such action as is necessary to appoint new Outside Director(s) to the Board of Directors.

(c) An "Outside Director" shall mean a director who, currently and for any of

the past three years, is and was not an officer of the Corporation (other than service as the chairman of the Board of Directors) or a parent or subsidiary of the Corporation and is not and was not otherwise employed by the corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the Corporation.

       Section 4. The chairman of the Board of Directors shall be an Outside Director (as defined above) and shall not hold any other office of the Corporation unless the appointment of the chairman is approved by two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors then in office,

12

provided , however , that if there is no chief executive officer or president of the Corporation as a result of the death, resignation or removal of such officer, then the chairman of the Board of Directors may also serve in an interim capacity as the chief executive officer of the Corporation until the Board shall appoint a new chief executive officer.

      Section 5. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall establish an audit committee whose principal purpose will be to oversee the Corporation's and its subsidiaries' accounting and financial reporting processes, internal systems of control, independent auditor relationships and audits of consolidated financial statements of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The audit committee will also determine the appointment of the independent auditors of the Corporation and any change in such appointment and ensure the independence of the Corporation's auditors. In addition, the audit committee will assume such other duties and responsibilities delegated to it by the Board of Directors and specified for it under applicable law and Exchange Governance Rules.

       Section 6. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall establish a corporate governance and nominating committee whose principal duties will be to assist the Board of Directors by identifying individuals qualified to become members of the Board of Directors consistent with criteria approved by the Board of Directors, to recommend to the Board of Directors for its approval the slate of nominees to be proposed by the Board of Directors to the stockholders for election to the Board of Directors, to develop and recommend to the Board of Directors the governance principles applicable to the Corporation, as well as such other duties and responsibilities delegated to it by the Board of Directors and specified for it under applicable law and Exchange Governance Rules. In the event the corporate governance and nominating committee will not be recommending a then incumbent director for inclusion in the slate of nominees to be proposed by the Board of Directors to the
stockholders for election to the Board of Directors, and provided such incumbent director has not notified the committee that he or she will be resigning or that he or she does not intend to stand for re-election to the Board of Directors, then, in the case of an election to be held at an annual meeting of stockholders, the corporate governance and nominating committee will recommend the slate of nominees to the Board of Directors at least thirty (30) days prior to the latest date required by the provisions of Sections 2.14 (advance notice of stockholder business) and 2.15 (advance notice of director nominations) of the Bylaws of the Corporation (as such provisions may be amended from time to time) for stockholders to submit nominations for directors at such annual meeting, or in the case of an election to be held at a special meeting of stockholders, at least ten (10) days prior
to the latest date required by the provisions of Sections 2.14 and 2.15 of the Bylaws for stockholders to submit nominations for directors at such special meeting.

If the General Corporation Law of Delaware is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as so amended.

       Section 2. The Corporation may indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to an action or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he, she, his or her testator or intestate is or was a director, officer, employee or agent at the request of the Corporation or any predecessor to the Corporation or serves or served at any other enterprise as a director, officer, employee or agent at the request of the Corporation or any predecessor to the Corporation.

      Section 3. Neither any amendment or repeal of any Section of this Article VII, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article VII, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VII, in respect of any matter

occurring, or any action or proceeding accruing or arising or that, but for this Article VII, would accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption of an inconsistent provision.

14

director. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified, or until such director's earlier death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

      Section 2.
