      ■ William Jurgensen was named chief executive officer of Nationwide
      Financial Services and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company in 2000. A
      Fortune 500 company, Nationwide was one of the world's largest
      providers of diversified insurance and financial-services products.
      Jurgensen's career in commercial and consumer banking facilitated a
      smooth transition into the insurance industry. His management style was
      described as hands-on and open; he encouraged participation from all
      employees regardless of their position within the company.
    

      BUILDS CAREER IN BANKING
    

      Jurgensen was born and raised in Nebraska and earned both his
      bachelor's and master's degrees in business administration
      from Creighton University in Omaha. His career in banking began in the
      early 1970s when he went to work for Norwest Corporation, an
      investment-services firm that later became part of Wells Fargo &
      Company. Jurgensen stayed with Norwest for 17 years, moving up through
      progressively more responsible and visible positions and ultimately
      becoming an executive vice president.
    

      In 1990 Jurgensen moved to First Chicago NBD Corporation, where until 1998
      he served as chief financial officer and executive vice president of the
      corporate and commercial banking units; he also oversaw operations,
      finance, and systems. In addition, from 1996 to 1998 Jurgensen was the
      chairman of FCC National Bank, First Chicago's credit-card
      subsidiary.
    

      In 1998 First Chicago merged with Bank One Corporation to form one of the
      largest U.S. bank-holding companies. Jurgensen stayed on in his role as
      executive vice president of corporate and commercial banking. He left Bank
      One in 2000 to become the chief executive officer of Nationwide.
    

      MOVES TO NATIONWIDE
    

      Jurgensen became the chief executive officer of Nationwide Financial
      Services and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company in 2000. He held seats on
      the boards of directors of Nationwide as well as several of its
      subsidiaries and affiliates and served as chairman of the central board
      from 2001 to 2003, when the functions of CEO and chairman were separated.
      As one of the world's largest providers of diversified insurance
      and financial-services products, Nationwide conducted business throughout
      the United States, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Nationwide affiliates
      operated in the areas of domestic property and casualty insurance, life
      insurance and retirement savings, asset management, and strategic
      investments.
    

      The insurance industry was new to Jurgensen, but his background in
      commercial banking eased his transition. His prior experience spanned
      financial services, products, and functions, and he was thus able to
      adeptly step into his new role at the helm of Nationwide.
    

      Jurgensen's initial efforts as CEO focused on strategically planned
      growth and management changes. Nationwide's traditional product and
      service lines were underperforming in the sluggish economy of the early
      2000s; in attempts to recover market share and restore profitability,
      Jurgensen intended to take the company in new directions. His efforts
      would conform with Nationwide's long history of groundbreaking
      approaches to remaining profitable during unfavorable economic times. In
      the 1920s the company had been the first to introduce discount auto
      insurance and in the 1930s was the first to offer both life and casualty
      insurance from the same agents.
       In the 1950s, going against common industry practice, Nationwide began
      offering mutual funds along with life insurance. Innovative
      variable-annuity products were introduced in the 1970s.
    

      Although he recognized that a diversified company could be more difficult
      to manage successfully, Jurgensen was committed to finding new avenues of
      growth. Still, believing that the company had strong presences in each
      existing market segment, he saw no compelling reason to make changes to
      Nationwide's core offerings, holdings, or business practices. He
      attributed much of the company's past success to its diverse
      product lines and distribution channels. He told 
      
        Business First–Columbus
      
      , "One of the things that attracted me to Nationwide in the first
      place was the fact that it had embraced multiple forms of distribution
      across all of its companies. It hasn't put a stake in the ground
      that it thinks there's only one way the future will unfold"
      (January 19, 2001).
    

      The company focused on growth prospects that would add secure value to the
      bottom line. Under Jurgensen's leadership Nationwide began
      expanding into new areas of financial services and worked to build a
      larger distribution network in order to increase sales capabilities; the
      company experienced dramatic international growth. Product lines were
      expanded as well, and Nationwide evolved into a global provider of total
      solutions for insurance and financial management needs.
    

      Jurgensen's approach was successful. In 2001 Nationwide had
      reported a loss of $295 million; one year later the company amassed $252
      million in income. The property and casualty units alone added
      approximately four hundred new employees during an economic era in which
      job losses and corporate cutbacks were making headlines across the United
      States. Jurgensen commented in 
      
        Business First–Columbus
      
      , "I think the number-one imperative for us now that we've
      established a foundation of profitability is to focus on the growth of the
      company. I think our focus is much more on policy count than it is on
      pricing increases. You're never really done. I think strategy
      formulation is a journey, not a destination" (January 19, 2001).
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      Jurgensen's management style was described as both handson and
      open; he attempted to make daily contact with key executives. He
      endeavored to remain accessible and approachable and to create an
      environment in which any worker could talk directly to executives. Under
      Jurgensen's leadership, input from employees at all levels was
      expected, not just accepted. He especially stressed the importance of
      gaining input from agents and agency staff, noting that they were the
      employees who interacted directly with policyholders on a daily basis. In
      his "Winning with Diversity" statement on the Nationwide Web
      site, Jurgensen remarked, "We have a tremendous amount of talent in
      this organization. We have a responsibility to use it. We must appreciate
      and leverage the skills and talents of every person in Nationwide. Each of
      us brings a unique background and set of personal experiences to our job.
      Mutual respect for, and trust in, these differences is critical if we are
      to maximize our collective knowledge."
    

      Community service was an important part of Jurgensen's leadership
      at Nationwide as well as his private life. Jurgensen himself was involved
      in organizations working in the areas of education, social service, and
      the arts. During his tenure at Nationwide the company contributed
      approximately $17 million annually to an array of charitable organizations
      around the world.
