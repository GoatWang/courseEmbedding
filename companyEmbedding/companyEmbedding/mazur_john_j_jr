So, so sorry to hear of Mr. Mazur's passing. He was a great guy and a wonderful friend to the family for many years. I have great memories of visits to the bakery with my dad and the generosity and kindness of he and his wife at family events and get togethers both in Clifton and at the lake. I'll never forget the masterpiece he put together for my wedding cake and the special care he took of us every time we dealt with him. He will be sorely missed and was a fine representative of that "greatest generation" from which he, his wife and our parents came. Rest in Peace Mr. Mazur.

Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
