Rex Geveden

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Rex Geveden, President and Chief Executive Officer of BWX Technologies. Former Executive Vice President of Teledyne Technologies Inc and former Associate Administrator of NASA


Rex Geveden is the President and Chief Executive Officer of BWX Technologies. Previously he was Chief Operating Officer.
Prior to his tenure with BWXT, Rex Geveden was Executive Vice President of Teledyne Technologies Inc and President of Teledyne Dalsa in Waterloo, Ontario. Previously he was the president of Teledyne Brown Engineering and the Associate Administrator of NASA before that. He was selected for that position by NASA chief Michael Griffin on August 17, 2005, after having served in an acting capacity since June of that year. Griffin created the position immediately prior to assigning Geveden to fill it. The Associate Administrator's task is described as "oversight for all the agency's technical missions' areas and field center operations".[1] Griffin also suggested Geveden was his right-hand man, saying "...if you get a decision from Rex, it's the agency's decision."[2]
Geveden's first job out of college was at Teledyne Brown Engineering (where he later became President). After a few years at Teledyne Brown, Geveden joined NASA in 1990, and worked on hardware design for a number of science satellite missions, including as project manager for the Optical Transient Detector satellite, the Lightning Imaging Sensor satellite, and the Gravity Probe B satellite, a successful test of frame dragging effects predicted by General Relativity. He was promoted to deputy director of the science directorate at Marshall Space Flight Center, then in 2003 to Deputy Director of Marshall Space Flight Center. In November 2004, he was promoted again to become chief engineer of NASA, simultaneously with a major expansion of that office's responsibilities, in the wake of the report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. Only seven months later, in the first weeks of Mike Griffin's administration in June 2005, Griffin made Geveden his acting associate administrator until the post was officially created.
Geveden is a native of Mayfield, Kentucky and a graduate of Lowes High School. He is married to Gail Geveden, and they have two children, Bridget and Jake. He received a bachelor's degree in engineering physics and master's degrees in physics in 1983 and 1984 respectively, both from Murray State University in Kentucky. Geveden also graduated from the Program Management School at the Defense Systems Management College.
Geveden announced his plans to leave NASA at the end of July 2007 to become president of Teledyne Brown Engineering in Huntsville, Alabama.[3] Mike Griffin praised Geveden on his departure saying he "possesses one of the most agile minds I have encountered".[4] Geveden was replaced as Associate Administrator of NASA by Christopher Scolese. In 2014, Teledyne announced the promotion of Geveden to President of Teledyne Dalsa following the retirement of DALSA's CEO, in addition to his role as Executive Vice President of Teledyne Technologies.

Rex Geveden, President and Chief Executive Officer of BWX Technologies. Former Executive Vice President of Teledyne Technologies Inc and former Associate Administrator of NASA


Rex Geveden is the President and Chief Executive Officer of BWX Technologies. Previously he was Chief Operating Officer.
Prior to his tenure with BWXT, Rex Geveden was Executive Vice President of Teledyne Technologies Inc and President of Teledyne Dalsa in Waterloo, Ontario. Previously he was the president of Teledyne Brown Engineering and the Associate Administrator of NASA before that. He was selected for that position by NASA chief Michael Griffin on August 17, 2005, after having served in an acting capacity since June of that year. Griffin created the position immediately prior to assigning Geveden to fill it. The Associate Administrator's task is described as "oversight for all the agency's technical missions' areas and field center operations".[1] Griffin also suggested Geveden was his right-hand man, saying "...if you get a decision from Rex, it's the agency's decision."[2]
Geveden's first job out of college was at Teledyne Brown Engineering (where he later became President). After a few years at Teledyne Brown, Geveden joined NASA in 1990, and worked on hardware design for a number of science satellite missions, including as project manager for the Optical Transient Detector satellite, the Lightning Imaging Sensor satellite, and the Gravity Probe B satellite, a successful test of frame dragging effects predicted by General Relativity. He was promoted to deputy director of the science directorate at Marshall Space Flight Center, then in 2003 to Deputy Director of Marshall Space Flight Center. In November 2004, he was promoted again to become chief engineer of NASA, simultaneously with a major expansion of that office's responsibilities, in the wake of the report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. Only seven months later, in the first weeks of Mike Griffin's administration in June 2005, Griffin made Geveden his acting associate administrator until the post was officially created.
Geveden is a native of Mayfield, Kentucky and a graduate of Lowes High School. He is married to Gail Geveden, and they have two children, Bridget and Jake. He received a bachelor's degree in engineering physics and master's degrees in physics in 1983 and 1984 respectively, both from Murray State University in Kentucky. Geveden also graduated from the Program Management School at the Defense Systems Management College.
Geveden announced his plans to leave NASA at the end of July 2007 to become president of Teledyne Brown Engineering in Huntsville, Alabama.[3] Mike Griffin praised Geveden on his departure saying he "possesses one of the most agile minds I have encountered".[4] Geveden was replaced as Associate Administrator of NASA by Christopher Scolese. In 2014, Teledyne announced the promotion of Geveden to President of Teledyne Dalsa following the retirement of DALSA's CEO, in addition to his role as Executive Vice President of Teledyne Technologies.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Rex Geveden, President and Chief Executive Officer of BWX Technologies. Former Executive Vice President of Teledyne Technologies Inc and former Associate Administrator of NASA


Rex Geveden is the President and Chief Executive Officer of BWX Technologies. Previously he was Chief Operating Officer.
Prior to his tenure with BWXT, Rex Geveden was Executive Vice President of Teledyne Technologies Inc and President of Teledyne Dalsa in Waterloo, Ontario. Previously he was the president of Teledyne Brown Engineering and the Associate Administrator of NASA before that. He was selected for that position by NASA chief Michael Griffin on August 17, 2005, after having served in an acting capacity since June of that year. Griffin created the position immediately prior to assigning Geveden to fill it. The Associate Administrator's task is described as "oversight for all the agency's technical missions' areas and field center operations".[1] Griffin also suggested Geveden was his right-hand man, saying "...if you get a decision from Rex, it's the agency's decision."[2]
Geveden's first job out of college was at Teledyne Brown Engineering (where he later became President). After a few years at Teledyne Brown, Geveden joined NASA in 1990, and worked on hardware design for a number of science satellite missions, including as project manager for the Optical Transient Detector satellite, the Lightning Imaging Sensor satellite, and the Gravity Probe B satellite, a successful test of frame dragging effects predicted by General Relativity. He was promoted to deputy director of the science directorate at Marshall Space Flight Center, then in 2003 to Deputy Director of Marshall Space Flight Center. In November 2004, he was promoted again to become chief engineer of NASA, simultaneously with a major expansion of that office's responsibilities, in the wake of the report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. Only seven months later, in the first weeks of Mike Griffin's administration in June 2005, Griffin made Geveden his acting associate administrator until the post was officially created.
Geveden is a native of Mayfield, Kentucky and a graduate of Lowes High School. He is married to Gail Geveden, and they have two children, Bridget and Jake. He received a bachelor's degree in engineering physics and master's degrees in physics in 1983 and 1984 respectively, both from Murray State University in Kentucky. Geveden also graduated from the Program Management School at the Defense Systems Management College.
Geveden announced his plans to leave NASA at the end of July 2007 to become president of Teledyne Brown Engineering in Huntsville, Alabama.[3] Mike Griffin praised Geveden on his departure saying he "possesses one of the most agile minds I have encountered".[4] Geveden was replaced as Associate Administrator of NASA by Christopher Scolese. In 2014, Teledyne announced the promotion of Geveden to President of Teledyne Dalsa following the retirement of DALSA's CEO, in addition to his role as Executive Vice President of Teledyne Technologies.
