BIOGRAPHY
REPRESENTATIVE MATTERS
LECTURES/PUBLICATIONS


Patrick McDonnell’s practice encompasses all aspects of litigation and trial work including: premises liability, employment law, professional liability, product liability, commercial litigation, defamation and premises security. He has tried more than 100 civil cases to verdict, most of them resulting in outright defense verdicts. His experience includes the successful defense of employers, premises owners, manufacturers and retailers in courtrooms throughout the country. He serves as a national coordinating counsel for a large retailer’s specialty trial group. In that capacity, he has conducted multiple “mock trials” and focus groups to develop comprehensive trial themes and defense strategies. 
For over 25 years, Patrick has represented one of the nation’s largest companies in both complex tort and employment litigation. He has defended catastrophic high exposure injury cases to favorable verdicts. He has represented employers against claims alleging discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, and disability. As a member of a large retailer’s rapid response team, he has investigated numerous large exposure incidents in order to preserve evidence, prepare internal reports, and make remedial recommendations. He has served in similar capacity to investigate incidents of premises and workplace violence, including fatal shootings and sexual assaults. In addition to traditional discrimination actions, Patrick has defended claims alleging violations of wage and hour, family medical leave, use of criminal records, and medical record disclosure violations. He has also defended defamation claims arising from these types of suits; and brought cost recovery and defamation claims on behalf of clients who were wrongfully sued. 
Patrick is a Certified Civil Trial Lawyer by the Supreme Court of New Jersey Board on Attorney Certification; a member of the American Board of Trial Advocates; included in Thomson Reuters’s Pennsylvania Super Lawyers® List; and identified by Martindale-Hubbell as “Preeminent” or “AV rated.” Patrick frequently lectures to retailers, transportation companies, and health care professionals on employer liability, risk management, expert witnesses, and workplace/premises security. 


Serve as coordinating and trial counsel for a large retailer for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (“CRPS”), traumatic brain and spinal cord injury cases throughout the country. In that capacity, we recently obtained a defense verdict in New Jersey arising from a display collapse where the plaintiff demanded multi-million dollar damages allegedly due to CRPS treated with multiple surgical and interventional procedures.  
Successfully defended a catastrophic multiple-fatality motor vehicle accident in two separate jurisdictions where the plaintiffs claimed that an employer required its manager to work a 22-hour shift before he fell asleep at the wheel during his drive home. In cases of first impression, both federal and state courts separately rejected any employer’s duty to prevent a fatigued employee from operating his personal vehicle to drive home.
Successfully defended a workplace shooting for a large retailer where a customer purchased ammunition and then shot his wife, an off-duty employee, in the back of the store. The District Court and then the Third Circuit held that an employer has no duty to prevent domestic violence at the workplace and an ammunition retailer has no duty to screen purchasers for signs of mental illness or homicidal tendencies.
Defended premises security case in Massachusetts that involved an assailant who abducted a young mother and toddler from a parking lot and traumatized them physically and mentally for several days. The plaintiff claimed that the parking lot offered inadequate security. The firm was retained only a few weeks before trial and conducted mock trials before focus groups to develop the most effective trial strategy. After the firm obtained multiple in limine orders that limited the types of “other crime and incidents” evidence plaintiff could present at trial, which essentially resulted in partial summary judgment for her key liability theory, the case settled on terms favorable to the client.
Successfully defended a large manufacturer of space heaters to a defense verdict where it was alleged that a large commercial rental property was destroyed in a fire due to manufacturing and design defects. 
Served as defense counsel in formulating a national trial strategy for “take home” asbestos cases. Focus groups were conducted in multiple magnet jurisdictions throughout the country to test themes and evaluate likely jurors’ reaction to certain epidemiological evidence.
Retained by corporation-defendant to serve as coverage and monitoring counsel to secure indemnity and “ready the case” prior to trial. Plaintiff suffered catastrophic injuries as a result of a defective toy and filed a product liability suit against the insolvent manufacturer and retailer. Patrick obtained insurance coverage for the retailer despite the manufacturer’s insolvency and effectively utilized focus group to “try” the case before negotiating a favorable settlement. The focus group sessions demonstrated that a jury was likely to consider the plaintiff’s own fault in causing the accident even though the injuries were severe.

Defended a premises security case that involved an assailant abducting a young mother and toddler from a parking lot. During a drug fueled crime spree, the assailant carjacked the plaintiff’s vehicle and forced her to drive to multiple locations where he raped her in the presence of her toddler. The plaintiff claimed that the parking lot offered inadequate security. Patrick was retained only a few weeks before trial due to an illness of prior defense counsel. Patrick utilized focus groups to develop successful defense narratives and learn the demographics of likely favorable jurors. The firm also filed multiple successful motions in limine that effectively limited the types of “other crime and incidents” evidence that plaintiff could present to establish negligent security.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Patrick is an ex police officer Narcotics Div. The computer software on his computer kept modifying Separation Agreement in ways I did not ask for. He ignored the feedback and I had to terminate his services: I paid $500.00 for services he did not provide. He called me late at night and said: "he was protecting me". He apparently patrolled my neighborhood where previous home owner (of my home) was murdered and 15 years later "someone" tried to murder me. Ruled "suicide" in both cases.
