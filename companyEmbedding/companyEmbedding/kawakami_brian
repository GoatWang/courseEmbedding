SALISBURY, Conn., Feb. 6, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Ascendant is pleased to announce that Brian Kawakami has been named its newest partner in the firm. Brian joined Ascendant in 2009 as Managing Director of the New York office. He had previously held compliance and legal positions, including serving as Chief Compliance Officer of Lazard Asset Management, INVESCO Institutional and Aeltus Investment Management (now ING Investments), and as General Counsel to a mutual fund company. A seasoned professional with experience in implementing effective compliance programs and solutions, Brian assists clients in implementing compliance solutions that are effective, cost efficient and aligned with regulatory expectations and business needs and realities. He consults on compliance risk evaluations and the implementation of risk management methodologies, prepares clients for regulatory examinations and due diligence meetings, assists clients in establishing compliance programs to comply with Rules 38a-1, 206(4)-7, 3012 and 3130, provides guidance in drafting compliance policies and manuals, designs continuing education training programs, and assists clients in their investigation and resolution of alleged violations. Brian is a frequent speaker on compliance matters at industry conferences, including the SEC's CCOutreach National Seminar. Brian is a FINRA arbitrator and member of the New York and Connecticut Bars. He earned his BA in Economics from Whitman College, MIM from the American Graduate School of International Management (Thunderbird) and JD from New York Law School.  
Ascendant President and CEO, Jon Higgins says, "We are thrilled to welcome Brian to our management team. He brings a depth of experience and expertise that benefits our clients tremendously; it is definitely a win-win for all parties."
Brian will also be a featured speaker at Ascendant's Compliance Conference "Today's Compliance Challenges: New Regulations plus Enterprise Risk Management Responsibilities" to be held at the Westin Riverwalk San Antonio, March 5 – 7, 2012.  Mr. Kawakami will be joined by industry experts such as Carlo di Florio (Director, OCIE, SEC), Kevin Goodman (Associate Regional Director, SEC), Steven Lentz (Partner, Faegre Benson), David Lui (CCO & Principal, Galliard Capital Management), Keith Marks (Partner, Ascendant Compliance), Ann Oglanian (President & CEO, ReGroup, LLC), Marianne Smythe, and John Walsh (Former Associate Director/ Chief Counsel, OCIE, SEC)among others.
