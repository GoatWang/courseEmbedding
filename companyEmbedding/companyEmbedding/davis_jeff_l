By Mssnappyfrom Milwaukee, WIAbout Me Midrange ShopperProsPerfect SizeVisually AppealingVivid DetailConsUnattractive Frame DesignBest UsesDecorationFill Wall SpaceGiftComments about UncommonGoods Personalized LP Record:My husband is a record collector, so when I saw this item on Uncommon Goods, it was a no-brainer to get this as his wedding gift from me. It took about 6 weeks to receive it. I was so excited when my husband opened the box until I saw a nick at the top of the wooden frame that was very noticeable. I was very upset, as I'd spent a lot of money on this item, but he said he'd just use a black marker to cover it up. and, once it was hung, he couldn't see the nick anyway. He absolutely loves it, but I'm still upset about the amount of money I paid to receive a defective piece of wooden frame. The packaging was great, so I'm not quite sure how the nick got there. I gave it a 4 star because of the idea of it and the fact that my husband loves it and doesn't want to send it back for a new one.Display Location:HallwayWas this a gift?:YesWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/31/2016 4.0Great anniversary gift idea By Amyfrom GeorgiaProsGreat Quality MaterialNice WorkmanshipPerfect SizeVisually AppealingConsBest UsesGiftComments about UncommonGoods Personalized LP Record:This gift was perfect because I went with the 'platinum' idea for our 20th wedding anniversary. I tracked down vinyl albums he didn't have in his collection and had some autographed.. as well as this gift. It worked perfectly with the over all idea because I had it labeled like most artist do for 'their platinum collection of songs'. It was a collection of our favorite songs while we were dating. Be sure to order early and stay on top of 'deadlines'.
