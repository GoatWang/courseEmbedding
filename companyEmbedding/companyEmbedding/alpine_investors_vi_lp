SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alpine Investors (“Alpine”), a San Francisco based private equity firm 
      specializing in high growth, founder-owned, lower middle market 
      companies in software and business services, announced the final closing 
      of its sixth fund, Alpine Investors VI, LP, (“Alpine VI” or the “Fund”) 
      at its hard cap of $532 million of capital commitments.
    


      Alpine VI officially launched at year end and was quickly

      garnering demand from leading endowments, family offices, foundations, 
      gatekeepers and pension plans.
    

      “We are thrilled to have built such a wonderful base of high-caliber and

      relationships with our CEOs and management teams over multiple funds.”
    

      “Alpine’s CEO-in-Residence strategy allows the firm to buy high quality 
      businesses in need of institutional management, where competition is 
      relatively scarce. This approach clearly resonated with investors,” said 
      Jennifer Cho Rinehart, CEO of Acalyx Advisors, which served as exclusive 
      placement advisor.
    

      Hogan Lovells served as legal counsel to Alpine.

Alpine Investors V SBIC, LP Acquires ARCOM




 
PRESS RELEASE – Read it on BusinessWire
SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 5, 2016 — Alpine Investors V SBIC, LP (Alpine), announced today that it has purchased Salt Lake City-based ARCOM, a leader in AEC software solutions that integrate building specification content.
ARCOM is a strategic partner to the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and maintains and distributes the organization’s AIA MasterSpec content, which is used by 88 percent of the top architectural and engineering firms in the United States.
“The U.S. non-residential construction market, which is just now starting to reap the tremendous benefits brought by technology, is forecast to grow for the next decade,” said Mark Strauch, a partner at Alpine and now a board member at ARCOM. “Our market research quickly identified ARCOM as a well-respected leader in delivering productivity-enhancing software solutions to provide the rich specification content needed by architects, engineers, designers and specification professionals. This combination of untapped market opportunity and the company’s established leadership was very attractive to us.”
Christopher Bushnell, AIA, who had served as ARCOM’s President and CEO for 10 years, will retire at the end of the year. Jim Contardi, a CEO-in-residence at Alpine, has assumed the role as CEO at ARCOM.
“I am thrilled to join the industry leaders at ARCOM to lead us into the next chapter,” said Contardi. “This talented team has built a strong foundation for growth and together, with Alpine’s support, we will scale ARCOM to provide the next level of innovative solutions to the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) market. This is just the first step into an exciting future.”
“ARCOM has a long history of providing leadership in the architecture and building design industry through delivery of MasterSpec, a product created by AIA for its members,” said AIA Executive Vice President / CEO, Robert Ivy, FAIA. “We are very confident in the new ownership of ARCOM and its new CEO, Jim Contardi, and our mutual investment in the future of MasterSpec.”

NEWS RELEASE - Commercial real estate venture gets funded for $250K from funded.com's funding provider. Comment: I was very pleased with the speed and professional attitude of the site. I will recommend this to anyone in the future. 

Greg S
 Decatur, IL





"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!" 

Rick R 
Entreprenuer





Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again. 

Faith D
Entreprenuer





I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
