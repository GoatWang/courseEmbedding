The Company is engaged in selling its ZERUST products and services to the automotive, electronics, electrical, mechanical, military and retail consumer markets.ZERUSTThe Company's ZERUST rust and corrosion inhibiting products include plastic and paper packaging, liquids and coatings, rust removers and cleaners, diffusers and engineered solutions designed specifically for the oil and gas industry. The Company also offers onsite technical consulting for rust and corrosion prevention issues across the world. In North America, the Company sells its ZERUST corrosion prevention solutions through a network of independent distributors and agents supported by a direct sales force. Internationally, it sells ZERUST through its subsidiaries and joint ventures.The Company's ZERUST packaging products contain chemical formulations that continuously release an invisible and odorless, corrosion-inhibiting vapor that passivates metal surfaces and thereby inhibits rust and corrosion. The Company has developed the means of infusing volatile corrosion inhibiting chemical systems (VCIs) into polyethylene and polypropylene resins. The Company offers a line of plastic packaging products in the form of low and high-density polyethylene bags and shroud film, including stretch, shrink, skin and bubble cushioning film. In addition to plastic packaging, the Company has developed additives to imbue kraft paper, corrugated cardboard, solid fiber and chipboard packaging materials with corrosion protection properties. The Company's ZERUST plastic and paper packaging products come in various thicknesses, strength enhancements, protection types, shapes and sizes. This product line also includes items, such as ZERUST gun cases, car covers and tool-drawer liners, which are focused on retail consumers.The Company's corrosion prevention solutions include a line of metal surface treatment liquids and coatings, which are oil, water and bio-solvent based, marketed under brand names, including Axxatec, Axxanol and Z-Maxx. Customers use a combination of the Company's liquids and coatings with ZERUST plastic and paper products to achieve corrosion protection during manufacturing, shipping and warehousing stages. The Company also sells rust removal and cleaning products designed to restore rusty parts to a usable condition by replacing cleaners that damage surfaces and fail to remove rust from complex metal surfaces, such as the teeth of small gears, under the Axxaclean brand name.The Company's corrosion prevention solutions include a line of corrosion inhibiting vapor diffusers, such as ZERUST ActivPak, ZERUST ICT Vapor Capsules, ZERUST ICT Plastabs and ZERUST ICT Cor-Tabs, ZERUST ICT Pipe Strip and ZERUST ICT Tube Strip.

ZERUST ReCAST-R VCI Dispensers protect the interior surfaces of aboveground storage tank roofs. The ZERUST ReCAST-SSB solutions protect the soil side bottoms (SSB) of aboveground storage tanks. The ZERUST Zerion line of powder-based inhibitor solutions includes Zerion FVS and AutoFog. The Sol-V C-Series is designed to provide corrosion prevention in voids and ZERUST Sol-V C-Series packaging allows VCIs to release while conserving a Sol-V blend of soluble corrosion inhibitors (SCIs) until water enters the system.Natur-TecThe Company manufactures and sells a range of bio-based and compostable (fully biodegradable) polymer resin compounds and finished products under the Natur-Tec brand. Natur-Tec resin compounds are produced by blending commercially available base resins with organic and inorganic fillers, and polymer modifiers and compatabilizers, using the Company's ReX Process. In this process, biodegradable polymers, natural polymers made from renewable, plant-biomass resources, and organic and inorganic materials are reactively blended in the presence of compatibilizers and polymer modifiers to produce bio-based and/or compostable polymer resin formulations that exhibit stable morphology. Natur-Tec resin compounds are available in several grades made for a range of applications, such as blown-film extrusion, extrusion coating and injection molding. The Natur-Tec compostable extrusion coating resin compounds are bio-based and biodegradable and are designed to replace conventional plastic materials for extrusion coating applications. Natur-Tec finished products include totally biodegradable and compostable trash bags, agricultural film and other single-use disposable products, such as compostable cutlery and food and consumer goods packaging that are marketed under the Natur-Bag or Natur-Ware brands. The Natur-Ware product line consists of bio-based and compostable cutlery made from the Natur-Tec compostable injection molding resin compounds.
