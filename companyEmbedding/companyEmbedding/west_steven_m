Barranca Street Suite 250AWest Covina, CA91791USssweat@stevensweatapc.comPhone: (626) 296-3555Review us on GoogleAs injury attorneys West Covina, we know that anyone can experience an accident at any time and at almost any place. Accidents have many causes and often result from the actions or negligence of others. The victims of such accidents will require the assistance of an award winning law firm that has helped hundreds of people in the San Gabriel Valley including Covina, El Monte and Baldwin Park, obtain compensation for injuries related to auto accidents, slip and falls, trucking collisions, motorcycle and other types of mishaps.How a West Covina Accident Lawyer Can HelpPersonal injury law is designed to help individuals who suffer injuries in mishaps that are the fault of someone else. A personal injury lawyer can help these victims take civil action against those deemed responsible for the purpose of receiving compensation. An attorney will help to guarantee that the victim receives an adequate monetary award to pay for the cost of medical care and any personal suffering or losses that may have resulted from the accident.Individuals, property owners, businesses and other organizations can be held responsible for personal injuries suffered by other parties. However, the process of proving liability and obtaining damages can be complicated. This is why the victims of accidents need legal assistance to ensure that they will receive fair treatment under the law.There are different aspects of the law that pertain to the issue of personal injury. The basis for most cases involves negligence on the part of someone or something. Under this principle, the responsible party did something that could be considered careless. The justification for any liability case is that the actions of the defendant went contrary to what a “reasonable” person would do under the same set of circumstances. One example would be a driver who greatly exceeded the posted speed limit and lost control of his vehicle, leading to a collision with another car. Another case could involve a business owner who failed to clean up water that had accumulated on the floor, causing a customer to slip and fall.In order to prevail in a personal injury case, the injured party must prove that the defendant had a responsibility to protect others and failed to do so, and that the injuries directly resulted from these actions. A personal injury lawyer will work diligently to prove exactly who is culpable in order guarantee the successful outcome of the claim.In cases of strict liability, the defendant can be deemed responsible without the need to prove actual negligence. Dog bites represent the largest number of cases in this category. Product liability is a type of strict liability in which manufacturers and sellers can be held responsible for injuries suffered by the users of defective products. An intentional wrongdoing involves the purposeful harm of one person by another, and these cases can involve both criminal and civil action against the defendant. A personal injury attorney understands the intricacies of the law and will use this knowledge to the best interests of each client.Anyone injured in an accident should immediately seek medical attention and gather as much information as possible about the mishap. The victim should also seek the services of a West Covina personal injury attorney, who will do what is necessary to assure both justice and adequate compensation.

America’s Worst Board Members: Steven M. West Of Cisco

Steven M. West, who has been a board member of Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) since April 1996, runs a company called Emerging Company Partners LLC. It claims to help companies execute business strategies and aid firms with stakeholders who want to see improved operating results. West had better not use his time at Cisco as a reference. He has not done much as a director, if a board member’s role is to help steer strategy and have a critical eye on operations.
Cisco’s CEO John Chambers is in the midst of disassembling much of what he built. He has already begun the process of re-focusing Cisco on its original core businesses including routers. How Chambers was allowed to diversify Cisco as much as he did is one of the most critical concerns for investors. Cisco’s stock is down nearly 20% over the last five years compared to the NASDAQ which is up 20%. 


Cisco’s operating results have been a disappointment recently. Revenue is up from $34.9 billion in the company’s 2007 fiscal year to $40 billion in the most recent period. Net income has only moved from $7.3 billion to $7.8 billion over the same time. In Cisco’s most recent quarter, revenue rose 6% to $10.4 billion. Net income fell 18% to $1.5 billion compared to the same period a year earlier.
West, who is chairman of the board’s audit committee, made $370,000 for his services to Cisco and its shareholders last year. Along with his fellow board members he gave CEO Chambers an $18.9 million compensation package. That was up from $9.2 million the year before.
West is a senior board member in terms of tenure. He also claims to be an expert on company management and has been a senior executive at several technology companies which include the CEO job at Hitachi Data Systems. As such, he shoulders as much of the blame for Chamber’s failures and the Cisco’s poor performance as anyone else.
