     There

							claimed to be 500ppm to 10,000ppm colloidal silver 
							for as much as $400 per quart. It is a total 
							fraud and is "Silver Protein" falsely 
							labeled as colloidal silver. There is no 
							such thing as 10,000ppm colloidal silver. The 
							claim is nonsensical.  The "silver 
							protein" scam (falsely labeled as "colloidal silver") are homemade 
							products made by just mixing silver powder with 
							gelatin or another "protein" to suspend the silver in - and then adding this to 
							water. It is completely worthless and no more 
							beneficial than rubbing a silver dollar against your 
							skin. Learn more about that scam to avoid it.

      
							Dozens of people also are now using $100

What are they

							What
							

color is REAL colloidal silver? There are

How is most Colloidal Silver sold online made?






     
      
							Most Colloidal Silver sold online 
									is being made by individuals in their garage 
									or a backroom using small, low amperage 
									transformers and silver wire recycled from 
									scrape sterling silver. This process 
									produces virtually no actual colloidal size 
									silver particles, which is explained  
									belong. These home-based or small-scale 
									manufacturers bottle what they make, stick a 
									label on it reading "colloidal silver," and 
									devote their efforts to trying to make 
									themselves seem like a major company and 
									expert in colloidal silver. They 
									particularly like Amazon, EBay and other 
									marketing sites as those do not allow a 
									customer contact phone number nor allow much 
									presentation of their product.       
									Some upload outstanding looking websites 
									with impressive information they paste in 
									plus links to voluminous amounts of 
									information, claimed laboratory reports, and 
									links to studies. Some believe if they rant 
									on their website against the F.D.A. somehow 
									that will convince you to buy their product. 
									In our opinion, you can form your own 
									opinion about any government agency 
									yourself. One of the more clever marketing 
									tactics is heavily advertise on Goggle a 
									seemingly independent reviewer and seeming 
									independent label that rated your product, 
									declaring your product superior. Of course, 
									no person just reviewing a product would 
									spend thousands of dollars a week on paid 
									Google advertising, would they. If you 
									research, you find both in the same small 
									city and, to no surprise, the so-called lab 
									recommends only that same product. Since few 
									people research such details, pretending to 
									be an independent 3rd party reviewer 
									vouching for your product is a quite clever 
									but old marketing tactic.        
									Unfortunately, the legitimate question of 
									purchasing personal health supplements 
									should not be who has the best looking label 
									or cleverest marketing tactics. The relevant 
									fact of such websites and online listings is 
									regardless of the appearance and promotional 
									language, virtually all such colloidal 
									silver sold online is not colloidal silver. 
									What is in those bottles is being made in 
									people's garages, small shops or kitchens 
									using small transformers of extremely low 
									amperage. The positive and negative of the 
									transformer is connected to thin wires of 
									recycled sterling silver (falsely claimed to 
									be .999 pure silver) in a small beaker of 
									water.       The low amperage 
									electricity of the tiny transformer slowly 
									"knocks off" particles of silver and the 
									other material in sterling silver in 
									essential random sizes. Virtually none 
									qualifies as colloidal size. This is a 
									single step process. Once each particle is 
									knocked there in nothing in the process 
									further reducing or altering the particle 
									size or shape. This liquid is put in a 
									bottle and a label reading "colloidal 
									silver" put on it. It is virtually a pure 
									profit item other than the cost of the 
									bottle and label. All efforts instead are 
									put into marketing and advertising. 
									      That process does not produce 
									colloidal silver. It produces a water 
									solution with bits of silver, along with the 
									other substances in the wire. Nearly all 
									such particles are of a size to be of no 
									health benefit whatsoever and structurally 
									can be very harmful. Because of the other 
									contaminants, such home/shop manufacturers 
									make up excuses for the tan, brown, green or 
									yellow tint of the contents. But even 
									briefing thinking of it tells you pure 
									colloidal silver is clear as water, other 
									than might have a shine to it in bright 
									light reflecting off the colloidal silver 
									suspended in the water. Neither water nor 
									silver is tan, brown, yellow or green. So 
									what it is? They have clever, but false, 
									excuses.        Whether these 
									home-based or small scale manufacturers have 
									the best of intentions believing their 
									claims or are simply trying to make a fast 
									buck any possible way, the fact is that such 
									products are defective, deceptive 
									advertising and can have harmful 
									consequences if ingested.   





What is Stabilized Colloidal Silver?





     The 
							production method used by  
							
Guardian Of 
							Eden is propriety. Production takes approximate 3 
							months. The result is pure and stabilized colloidal silver in high 
							concentration of the correct particle size and shape.
 

  
							

  As an analogy for 
							comparison of production methods, image a 12 inch 
							diameter solid glass ball. You want to break that 
							glass ball into smaller pieces. So you take a hammer 
							and hit it one time shattering the ball. This single 
							step is all you do. From this, you will have a few 
							microscopic size bits of glass, but 99%+ of it will 
							still be large and jagged random size pieces of 
							glass. Virtually none the glass pieces 
							will be "colloidal" size nor would you dare run your 
							hand thru those glass bits for all the jagged edges 
							that would cut you - and you certainly not try to 
							swallow them or put them under your tongue. Yet this 
							is essentially how all products sold online as 
							colloidal silver are made: a single step process 
							using very low amperage current thru recycled 
							sterling silver wire in a single step to knock of 
							random sizes and shapes of pieces of silver.  

 
     What if instead you put a 
							bucket of tiny glass beads 1/1000th the size of a 
							pinhead inside a 5,000 pound hammer-press? Then 
							every millisecond the press would crush the tiny 
							glass particles - millions of times an hour - and do 
							so continuously for 3 months. 

     The 
							result? Particles of glass as small as they can be 
							broken down to, finer than dust. You could run your 
							hand thru it nor would it hurt you internally as the 
							constantly pounding had rounded the microscopic size 
							particles the same way flowing water over time will round 
							out hard river rocks, eliminating the sharp and 
							jagged edges. 


 
      
							While this is an 
							analogy and no mechanical press is used in either 
							method, it explains the production theory and 
							difference. Guardian Of Eden does not use recycled 
							sterling silver wire. Rather, the process starts 
							with 1.2 nano meter size pure silver powder. The 
							production of colloidal silver from this microscopic sized pure silver powder consists of 
							approximately 3 months of continuously shattering 
							the silver particles to ever smaller size, plus 
							shaping the particles in the process. The result is 
							four fold:

 
    
							1. Particles of pure silver are actually reduced to 
							colloidal size, not random size hoping some are 
							colloidal.
     2. 
							There are no other contaminate metals as 
							the process began with pure silver.
     3. The 
							particles are of near uniform size, not random large 
							to small sizes.
     4. The 
							particles of silver are "stabilized." In lay terms, 
							this means the rough and sharp edges are eliminated. 
							Silver atoms          have no sharp or rough edges. 
							However, silver bits 
							randomly knocked-off of silver wire do and that how 
							most of what is 
							sold as colloidal silver is made.



									Why Stabilized Matters?



 
      
							The 
									resulting colloidal silver in G.O.E's 
									process is true colloidal silver of 
									colloidal sized silver particles. That fact 
									alone makes the Colloidal Silver the real 
									thing and is reason enough to make it your 
									choice. But that it also is stabilized is 
									extremely significant.
 
      
									Human cells are very small. Not only can too 
									large of silver particles provide no 
									benefit, but also jagged shaped silver 
									particles have 5 serious negative effects:
 
   1. They 
									will not be absorbed. They will simply pass 
									thru the digestive system, even if used as 
									drops under the tongue as        the 
									human body cannot break down metallic 
									silver. It must already be broken down.
									
   2. If 
									small enough to be absorbed, the jagged 
									edges can damage (cut) cells, meaning the 
									supplement meant to help you         
									health-wise is instead harming you.
   3. Your 
									immune system may detect this is a harmful 
									substance and try to remove it, when you 
									want your immune system        
									working for you rather than fighting off the 
									health supplement you took. This also can 
									developing into having an       
									allergic reaction to silver in the future as  
									your immune system now believes silver is 
									harmful to you.
    4. 
									The odd shapes and sizes create random and 
									conflicting electrical properties. Silver is 
									highly electrical conductive. 
    
									5. Non-stabilized colloidal silver can 
									significantly adversely react with certain 
									chemicals in your body, with supplements,
									        
									with OTCs and with prescription drugs you 
									make take. 
 
     
									Because our Colloidal Silver is stabilized 
									(meaning particles correctly shaped) it will 
									not cause any of those 5 effects. This is 
									why generally speaking stabilized colloidal 
									silver is approximately 20 times (2000%) 
									more effective than non-stabilized colloidal 
									silver of equal ppm concentration. 












Excuses for why others Colloidal Silver is not 
							clear?




 
      
							 If you were 
							purchasing a bottle of water to drink, and the water 
							was brown, green, yellow or tan, would you still 
							believe it is pure water? Could a merchant tell you 
							enough words to convince you that pure water is not 
							clear? Yet that is what many home-based makers of 
							colloidal silver claim. Instead, they will claim 
							colloidal silver must be the color of what they are 
							selling. Other merchants simply will not say. On our 
							Truth About Colloidal Silver page we explain why 
							what they are selling is not clear.
 
     
							True colloidal silver is clear for obvious reasons:
							
     1. Pure water is clear
     2. Colloidal particles 
							are too small to see. If you can see the particles 
							they are massively too large to be colloidal or of 
							any benefit
     3. Even if you could see the silver, 
							silver in its natural for is gray, not brown, tan, 
							yellow or green.
     4. If stabilized it also if 
							reflective. This also means no color. 
 

     On our 
							Truth About 
							Colloidal Silver page we explain why what they are 
							selling is not clear, meaning what other than silver 
							actually in the bottle. If you are on a website and 
							there are excuses for why there is a tint to their 
							colloidal silver, we strongly urge you to pass that 
							one by as it can not possibly be pure colloidal 
							silver.




COMPARISON TO TOP 
							ADVERTISERS OF COLLOIDAL SILVER






 
      
							It is the parts per million and reputation of the 
							producer/manufacturer that matters with colloidal silver, not the 
							website's self-promotional language. Below is a 
							chart measuring the ppm level of top advertising 
							merchants online. 
 
    
							Guardian Of 
							Eden is known as one of the 
							premier producers of health and dietary products 
							since 1989. We are a real, established supplier of 
							natural and alternative health choice supplements 
							since 1983. We have real, live customer 
							representatives. Most online sellers of colloidal 
							silver are making it in their garage of shop with cheap 
							equipment, but create websites making them appear as  
							a major company. Most do not have any contact phone 
							number. All real companies do. Please continue to a 
							comparison below.

 

 


									Comparing Prices 
									Based On Colloidal Silver Content





 
      
							For the comparison chart below, we accept their claimed 
							ppm level, though in fact that is rarely even close 
							to accurate.
							Most merchants hope people price based upon the 
							ounces of liquid in the bottle, not the amount of 
							colloidal silver in the bottle. Yet it is only the 
							amount of colloidal silver that matters, not how 
							much water in the bottle.  

     Remember, it is the 
							ppm level that matters because all the rest is just 
							water. With extremely weak colloidal silver content they 
							then put their money instead into marketing and 
							advertising. Their home-making little systems can 
							not make high concentration silver solution - 
							colloidal or otherwise. So they have to put their 
							efforts into marketing instead because they are 
							mostly just selling bottles of water. The chart below shows the actual cost effect 
							of competitor's dilution levels. There is no 
							reasonable justification for the extreme pricing for 
							how diluted and weak their products are.



     
							For actual colloidal silver content, they are 
							charging 1500% to over 3000% more, because they are 
							mostly selling bottles of water. 



   
    
							Below is a comparison of top advertisers and a 
							sampling of other home-based products labeled and 
							sold as colloidal silver:

WARNING ABOUT "ULTRA 
							SILVER"






 

 
      
							We do not 
									hesitate to 
									advise that "Ultra Silver Colloidal Silver" 
									is a 100% deceptive product in that it is 
									not colloidal silver, but what is called 
									"protein silver." Ultra Silver claims 
									concentrations as high as 10,000ppm - which 
									is impossible as water could not hold as 
									much silver in suspension - and on the 
									ingredients he states the bottle contains an 
									unidentified "protein." Silver is a metal, 
									not a protein. 
      
									There are over a million different 
									"proteins" so "protein" is an ingredient 
									would be the same as posting an ingredient 
									is "carbohydrate" or "liquid." Some proteins 
									are among the deadly poisons on earth. 
									"Protein silver" is simply putting silver 
									powder in a "protein." Not all proteins are 
									safe.  
									The powder is the size of boulders to your 
									cells. Even if a non-toxic protein, protein 
									silver is worthless for health, no different 
									than rubbing a sterling silver teaspoon 
									against your skin, other than it is worse 
									since you are to swallow it.     For this 
									deceptive product he charges as much as 
									$399.95 per quart and $149.95 for 4 ounces.* This is virtually a pure 
									profit for which he massive spends on 
									advertising hoping a few people falls for 
									this deception. He also urges people to buy 
									it and dilute it, and sell it online for a 
									profit, so much of what is offered online is 
									this worthless and deceptive protein silver 
									falsely sold as colloidal silver. 

 
     Follow 
									this link to the ingredients statement off 
									their website, though since have been 
									replacing the ingredients statement to 
									delete reference to "protein." Again, silver 
									is not a protein and there is no protein in 
									colloidal silver, nor does he even state 
									what the "protein" is. His website also 
									makes unsupportable health benefits claims.
      
									Please help spread this warning. It is this 
									extreme level of deception that tends to 
									lead to government bans, including of the 
									legitimate products.
 
Don't 
									just take our word for it, click here and we 
									prove this warning is accurate:

Pure (.999) Silver Bullion Drops Add-On*
*Only Available With Order of Colloidal Silver


     

We will add 1/4th or 1/2 ounce of pure (.999) Silver Bullion Drops to your Colloidal Silver bottle. True Colloidal silver enthusiasts kept silver bullion drops in their bottles of Colloidal Silver claiming this preserves the correct ionization and magnetic traits to the silver nano-particles. Guardian Of Eden stores their colloidal silver also with silver bullion drops. While not necessary, this is an option we offer. 
			   

     
			  
Note: The silver bullion drops mix range in size from about 1/20th to twice the size of BBs. To get an idea of how much 1/2 ounce of silver is, an American Silver dollar weights precisely 1 full ounce. We simply add the silver shot bullion to your bottle's contents.* ALL orders are filled PER ORDER and ALL are tested for PPM level immediately prior to filling. Because the smaller drops are very light, they are not easily removed from the bottle unless allowed to entirely dry.
 
*We had too many problems with a tiny bag of silver shot included with orders as it was too easily lost in the packaging. A small sticker will be on your bottle indicating it has 1/4 or 1/2 ounces of .999 Silver bullion shot added to the contents.

					will never spoil and you are prepared if public sale is 
					banned as it has been in Europe.

				decades and operate in numerous commercial facilities. We

				we offer. We also do private labeling for hundreds of companies,

				importantly, we tell you how the Colloidal Silver we offer is 
				made and we do not make extreme promises of immediate cures for 
				every known disease and ailment like fraudulent sellers do.
				
 






What to Watch for to avoid INTERNET FRAUD on Colloidal Products
						And why this is so important
 

 


According to a study by the F.D.A. over 80% of all health and dietary supplements now sold online do not contain 
									ANY of the claimed ingredients. 
									 


 
     
							Modern website templates allow anyone to make it 
							look like they are a real company. People who are 
							not familiar with constructing websites do not 
							realize there are free website templates show 
							employees, laboratories, facilities, clients and 
							customers and more - all fake. Many are high school 
							and college kids who are computer savvy. It is a 
							money-making game to them. They may take pictures from Google Images, claiming this is who they are, claim to be doctors, PhDs, biochemists or any other claim.
 


 EXAMPLES OF WHAT TO BEWARE OF REGARDING 
							COLLOIDAL SILVER: 
1. They claim to have 500ppm and higher colloidal 
							silver. This is worthless "protein silver" which is 
							just mixing silver powder with gelatin. It has no 
							beneficial value whatsoever and is 100% worthless.
 

2. The seller makes up some other name for what they are selling like 
							Super Silver, MessaSilver, MaxiSilver, AtomSilver, 
							Nano Silver, UltramaxSilver, etc - 
							and then bizarrely brag they are the only person/company selling it. It bizarre because it is a non-existence substance for a name they just made up - they claim they are the only one selling it 
							(when there is no such thing as what they claim they are selling.) 
							If they are selling Colloidal Silver, why would they 
							call it something else?   
							
 

Some of such 
							websites are massively voluminous to link after link 
							of studies, details and descriptions - all as 
							diversion. It is as if you were reading pages and 
							pages about diamonds, with the seller hoping you do 
							not notice the person is selling "real genuine 
							diamondite," meaning it is not a diamond at all. 
							Does the seller tell you the actual ingredients? 
							Does it have "protein?" NO colloidal silver has 
							"protein." Silver and water are not organic. Protein 
							is. Or why does the seller not call it colloidal 
							silver, though talks about colloidal silver?
 

3. They also sell other EXTREMELY health destructive products also called Colloidal. For example, colloidal palladium* and 
							colloidal platinum** are EXTREMELY health destructive! Iridium is another example. Anyone who would try to sell you products that destroy human health are SO horrific why would you possibly believe their Colloidal Silver is legitimate. Other examples include claiming they are selling colloidal silica, colloidal zinc and colloidal - or sticking the word 
							colloidal in front of anything else they can think of, and then claiming amazing health benefits.
 

It is hard to believe anyone 
							would sell a product known to damage a person's health, isn't it? Most likely their rational is that since all they REALLY are selling is probably bottles of water anyway they are only stealing from you, not killing you. Thieves do not care about you. They only care about your money. If they can convince you to buy a bottle of water with anything in it to show on a ppm meter, they will do it.

 

4. They claim laboratory tests PROVE their product. Anyone can doctor up a lab report or buy a legitimate product and have it tested, and then claim that is what they are selling.

 

5. Testimonials. Anyone can make up testimonials. Unless they provide the names, addresses and phone numbers of such people testimonials are worthless.

 
 * Palladium
							
is highly toxic (poisonous) and is 
							a known carcinogenic (causes cancers) and 
							can permanently damage cellular DNA.
							
 ** Platinum is toxic and causes life 
							threatening and permanent bone 
							marrow, liver and kidney damage.
 




 
Is our colloidal silver more expensive?

 


     
						No. Even without 
						this super discount sale it is FAR less costly than the fake solutions sold online 
						due to how concentrated it is. 
 
 
						             Why you should not buy homemade colloidal silver 
						sold online even if on a credible looking website:
     There is a clear irony and surprising the contradictions you find by those selling the fake colloidal silver and also selling kits to make it. While their prices for fake colloidal silver are extremely high at $100 a gallon or more, at the same time they boast if you buy their kits (usually well over $100), you can make it for pennies a gallon. Do you see the contradiction? If it can be made for a 
						nickel a gallon, why do they charge over $100 a gallon to buy it from them if you don't want to make it yourself?
          			                      	
				    
				
						Seriously, does anyone really 
						believe they can make TRUE colloidal silver for 2 cents a quart? What you know is what they are selling you didn't cost them more than 2 cents a quart to make - probably in their kitchen with one of their own battery charger with a timer on it kits. 



What is the concentration level?




    
						Our colloidal silver is a minimum of 120ppm and gold is a minimum of 100 ppm 
						unless specified otherwise. In addition to be 
						true colloidal silver, it is 
						300% to 500% more concentrated that others claim to be 
						offering and 20 times more effective.





WHY BUY NOW?




      
						Legitimate colloidal silver is virtually impossible to find 
						online anymore. You can find homemade ionic silver 
						people falsely labeled colloidal silver. Colloidal silver has nearly an indefinite shelf life. It never spoils. It may not be publicly available to buy at all soon. 
						There also is a real prospect public sales of colloidal 
						silver will be outlawed as it recently was in all 
						European countries. What we offer is generally 300% 
						to 500% more concentrated than what most offer, meaning 300% 
						to 500% more volume, and it is true colloidal silver. To 
						reduce it merely add distilled water. 1 quart of our 120 
						ppm colloidal silver equals 1 gallon of 30 ppm sold by 
						others.

IS COLLOIDAL SILVER TOXIC?

 


                        
                   
                    There are no instances of anyone suffering any adverse health affects from any level of usage 
						of colloidal silver.   

 

 TRIVIA FACT 


      
								Did you know that N.A.S.A. uses colloidal 
						silver to purify water abort the International Space 
						Station? With limited water onboard due to it's 
						weight to put into space, for drinking water urine is 
						purified and recycled. Part of the process involves 
						colloidal silver as it will kill biological contaminates 
						and organisms other sterilizing additions do not and it 
						is 100% safe. This is how powerful and yet safe 
								REAL Colloidal Silver is.










                                      WHAT IS THE SHELF LIFE OF LEGITMATE 
						COLLOIDAL SILVER?
Virtually forever as it does not spoil.
				Stock up before sales are banned.        



     The shelf life of true Colloidal Silver is virtually forever. The shelf life of our capped colloidal 
						silver is centuries if not seriously contaminated. 
						If not refrigerated, colloidal gold by itself can spoil by the 
						water going bad in about 2 years. But true concentrated colloidal silver will never spoil, weaken or expire. So you should stock some if you suspect you may ever want it in the future. 
	  					
 





Why Concentration (ppms) Matter In 
					  Figuring ACTUAL Price





 





 

 









Remember, when 
							  you are buying Colloidal Silver, you are buying 
							  ppms, not bottle volume. 
 The 
							  medium for Colloidal Silver is pure (distilled) 
							  water.  A QUART of 120ppm Colloidal Silver equals 
							  a GALLON of 30ppm Colloidal Silver. To reduce it 
							  to 30ppm (if you wish, or just use less drops), 
							  simply add 3 times as much distilled water and you 
							  have 1 gallon of 30ppm Colloidal Silver for the 
							  price of 1 quart. 1 quart of 120ppm Colloidal 
							  Silver equals 1 1/2 gallons of 20ppm Colloidal 
							  Silver.






     

 One quart of our 120ppm Colloidal Silver equals 1 Gallon of what other claim is 30ppm Colloidal Silver, with a gallon of 30ppm Colloidal silver 
						  being sold for as much as over $200 per gallon. Our 
						  sales price is an extreme & temporary price reduction sale 
						  that Colloidal Silver enthusiasts will recognize. 
						  Hopefully you do too.
 

     
					  HOW TO DILUTE 120ppm TO 30ppm if wish to? It is 
						  simple! To dilute a quart of our 120ppm Colloidal silver to 30ppm Colloidal silver, simply pour the quart of Colloidal Silver 120ppm into a CLEAN gallon container and fill the rest ;with distilled water (not tap or mineral water). 
						  You have 1 gallon of TRUE 30ppm Colloidal for less than 1/4th others are selling what they claim is 30ppm Colloidal Silver. Regardless of the 
						  quantity you wish to reduce, it is simply adding 3 
						  times as much distilled water to reduce 
						  120ppm to 30ppm. Or just use 1/4th as many drops if 
						  you are using a dropper for measuring personal 
						  usage.   

    Useful 
						  Trivia:
            		                        	There are 
						  approximate 300 drops per ounce of water with our 
				    droppers included FREE with your purchase.





 

Bulk/Wholesale Sale on Colloidal Silver

120ppm Colloidal Silver By The Gallon



    
This EXTREME and temporary sales 
price is 70% to 80% less than what others currently charge. The reason is they 
are claiming 30ppm concentration. With this sale, our Colloidal Silver is 120ppm 
concentration which is 400% more concentrated.



    

Currently, 30ppm Colloidal Silver is being sold elsewhere for as much as over $200 per gallon with the method it was produced kept secret. Our 120ppm Colloidal Silver is 400% more concentrated. One gallon of our 120ppm Colloidal Silver equals FOUR GALLONS of 30ppm Colloidal Silver. To make 1 gallon of our 120ppm Colloidal Silver equal 4 gallons of 30ppm Colloidal Silver, simply add 3 parts DISTILLED water to our 120ppm Colloidal Silver. Stir or shake well and you have 30ppm Colloidal Silver - and our 
	colloidal silver is TRUE Colloidal Silver.

    
Gallon containers arrive in an appropriate white chemical resistant jug. You can replace it with glass containers upon receiving it if you wish.  Unlike our 8 to 32 ounce bottles, our gallon jug labels only contain a line for you to write the date you received it for your own record. Unless EXTREMELY contaminated, TRUE Colloidal Silver will NEVER spoil or weaken. With long term shortage, you may wish to shake the bottle.



     REPACKAGERS: If you repackage Colloidal Silver for 
	Retail Sales and would like to offer LEGTIMATE 30ppm or less Colloidal 
	Silver, this is your chance to do so, while allowing yourself a fair margin 
	of profit.


THESE EXTREMELY REDUCED SALE PRICES WILL NOT LAST LONG.
We STRONGLY 
	suggest buying a gallon.

Peterbilt hires Darrin Siver as new GM




CCJ Staff




                            | May 23, 2013                        



















Peterbilt Motors has hired Darrin Siver as its new general manager in a move to replace outgoing GM Bill Kozek, who announced this week he was leaving PACCAR after 26 years to become the president of Navistar’s North American Trucks and Parts division.
Siver assumes the role from his general manger position at PACCAR Parts. He’s been with the company for 19 years.
Todd Acker, Peterbilt’s Director of Marketing Planning & Communications, said Siver hit the ground running at Peterbilt and is already “traveling extensively, (and will be) meeting our dealers over the next several weeks.”

							fraud and is "Silver Protein" falsely 
							labeled as colloidal silver. There is no 
							such thing as 10,000ppm colloidal silver. The 
							claim is nonsensical.  The "silver 
							protein" scam (falsely labeled as "colloidal silver") are homemade 
							products made by just mixing silver powder with 
							gelatin or another "protein" to suspend the silver in - and then adding this to

How is most Colloidal Silver sold online made?






     
      
							Most Colloidal Silver sold online 
									is being made by individuals in their garage 
									or a backroom using small, low amperage 
									transformers and silver wire recycled from 
									scrape sterling silver. This process 
									produces virtually no actual colloidal size 
									silver particles, which is explained  
									belong. These home-based or small-scale 
									manufacturers bottle what they make, stick a 
									label on it reading "colloidal silver," and 
									devote their efforts to trying to make 
									themselves seem like a major company and 
									expert in colloidal silver. They 
									particularly like Amazon, EBay and other 
									marketing sites as those do not allow a 
									customer contact phone number nor allow much 
									presentation of their product.       
									Some upload outstanding looking websites 
									with impressive information they paste in 
									plus links to voluminous amounts of 
									information, claimed laboratory reports, and 
									links to studies. Some believe if they rant 
									on their website against the F.D.A. somehow 
									that will convince you to buy their product. 
									In our opinion, you can form your own 
									opinion about any government agency 
									yourself. One of the more clever marketing 
									tactics is heavily advertise on Goggle a 
									seemingly independent reviewer and seeming 
									independent label that rated your product, 
									declaring your product superior. Of course, 
									no person just reviewing a product would 
									spend thousands of dollars a week on paid 
									Google advertising, would they. If you 
									research, you find both in the same small 
									city and, to no surprise, the so-called lab 
									recommends only that same product. Since few 
									people research such details, pretending to 
									be an independent 3rd party reviewer 
									vouching for your product is a quite clever 
									but old marketing tactic.        
									Unfortunately, the legitimate question of 
									purchasing personal health supplements 
									should not be who has the best looking label 
									or cleverest marketing tactics. The relevant 
									fact of such websites and online listings is 
									regardless of the appearance and promotional 
									language, virtually all such colloidal 
									silver sold online is not colloidal silver. 
									What is in those bottles is being made in 
									people's garages, small shops or kitchens 
									using small transformers of extremely low 
									amperage. The positive and negative of the 
									transformer is connected to thin wires of 
									recycled sterling silver (falsely claimed to 
									be .999 pure silver) in a small beaker of 
									water.       The low amperage 
									electricity of the tiny transformer slowly 
									"knocks off" particles of silver and the 
									other material in sterling silver in 
									essential random sizes. Virtually none 
									qualifies as colloidal size. This is a 
									single step process. Once each particle is 
									knocked there in nothing in the process 
									further reducing or altering the particle 
									size or shape. This liquid is put in a 
									bottle and a label reading "colloidal 
									silver" put on it. It is virtually a pure 
									profit item other than the cost of the 
									bottle and label. All efforts instead are 
									put into marketing and advertising. 
									      That process does not produce 
									colloidal silver. It produces a water 
									solution with bits of silver, along with the 
									other substances in the wire. Nearly all 
									such particles are of a size to be of no 
									health benefit whatsoever and structurally 
									can be very harmful. Because of the other 
									contaminants, such home/shop manufacturers 
									make up excuses for the tan, brown, green or 
									yellow tint of the contents. But even 
									briefing thinking of it tells you pure 
									colloidal silver is clear as water, other 
									than might have a shine to it in bright 
									light reflecting off the colloidal silver 
									suspended in the water. Neither water nor 
									silver is tan, brown, yellow or green. So 
									what it is? They have clever, but false, 
									excuses.        Whether these 
									home-based or small scale manufacturers have 
									the best of intentions believing their 
									claims or are simply trying to make a fast 
									buck any possible way, the fact is that such 
									products are defective, deceptive 
									advertising and can have harmful 
									consequences if ingested.   





What is Stabilized Colloidal Silver?





     The 
							production method used by  
							
Guardian Of 
							Eden is propriety. Production takes approximate 3 
							months. The result is pure and stabilized colloidal silver in high 
							concentration of the correct particle size and shape.
 

  
							

  As an analogy for 
							comparison of production methods, image a 12 inch 
							diameter solid glass ball. You want to break that 
							glass ball into smaller pieces. So you take a hammer 
							and hit it one time shattering the ball. This single 
							step is all you do. From this, you will have a few 
							microscopic size bits of glass, but 99%+ of it will 
							still be large and jagged random size pieces of 
							glass. Virtually none the glass pieces 
							will be "colloidal" size nor would you dare run your 
							hand thru those glass bits for all the jagged edges 
							that would cut you - and you certainly not try to 
							swallow them or put them under your tongue. Yet this 
							is essentially how all products sold online as 
							colloidal silver are made: a single step process 
							using very low amperage current thru recycled 
							sterling silver wire in a single step to knock of 
							random sizes and shapes of pieces of silver.  

 
     What if instead you put a 
							bucket of tiny glass beads 1/1000th the size of a 
							pinhead inside a 5,000 pound hammer-press? Then 
							every millisecond the press would crush the tiny 
							glass particles - millions of times an hour - and do 
							so continuously for 3 months. 

     The 
							result? Particles of glass as small as they can be 
							broken down to, finer than dust. You could run your 
							hand thru it nor would it hurt you internally as the 
							constantly pounding had rounded the microscopic size 
							particles the same way flowing water over time will round 
							out hard river rocks, eliminating the sharp and 
							jagged edges. 


 
      
							While this is an 
							analogy and no mechanical press is used in either 
							method, it explains the production theory and 
							difference. Guardian Of Eden does not use recycled 
							sterling silver wire. Rather, the process starts 
							with 1.2 nano meter size pure silver powder. The 
							production of colloidal silver from this microscopic sized pure silver powder consists of 
							approximately 3 months of continuously shattering 
							the silver particles to ever smaller size, plus 
							shaping the particles in the process. The result is 
							four fold:

 
    
							1. Particles of pure silver are actually reduced to 
							colloidal size, not random size hoping some are 
							colloidal.
     2. 
							There are no other contaminate metals as 
							the process began with pure silver.
     3. The 
							particles are of near uniform size, not random large 
							to small sizes.
     4. The 
							particles of silver are "stabilized." In lay terms, 
							this means the rough and sharp edges are eliminated. 
							Silver atoms          have no sharp or rough edges. 
							However, silver bits 
							randomly knocked-off of silver wire do and that how 
							most of what is 
							sold as colloidal silver is made.



									Why Stabilized Matters?



 
      
							The 
									resulting colloidal silver in G.O.E's 
									process is true colloidal silver of 
									colloidal sized silver particles. That fact 
									alone makes the Colloidal Silver the real 
									thing and is reason enough to make it your 
									choice. But that it also is stabilized is 
									extremely significant.
 
      
									Human cells are very small. Not only can too 
									large of silver particles provide no 
									benefit, but also jagged shaped silver 
									particles have 5 serious negative effects:
 
   1. They 
									will not be absorbed. They will simply pass 
									thru the digestive system, even if used as 
									drops under the tongue as        the 
									human body cannot break down metallic 
									silver. It must already be broken down.
									
   2. If 
									small enough to be absorbed, the jagged 
									edges can damage (cut) cells, meaning the 
									supplement meant to help you         
									health-wise is instead harming you.
   3. Your 
									immune system may detect this is a harmful 
									substance and try to remove it, when you 
									want your immune system        
									working for you rather than fighting off the 
									health supplement you took. This also can 
									developing into having an       
									allergic reaction to silver in the future as  
									your immune system now believes silver is 
									harmful to you.
    4. 
									The odd shapes and sizes create random and 
									conflicting electrical properties. Silver is 
									highly electrical conductive. 
    
									5. Non-stabilized colloidal silver can 
									significantly adversely react with certain 
									chemicals in your body, with supplements,
									        
									with OTCs and with prescription drugs you 
									make take. 
 
     
									Because our Colloidal Silver is stabilized 
									(meaning particles correctly shaped) it will 
									not cause any of those 5 effects. This is 
									why generally speaking stabilized colloidal 
									silver is approximately 20 times (2000%) 
									more effective than non-stabilized colloidal 
									silver of equal ppm concentration. 












Excuses for why others Colloidal Silver is not 
							clear?




 
      
							 If you were 
							purchasing a bottle of water to drink, and the water 
							was brown, green, yellow or tan, would you still 
							believe it is pure water? Could a merchant tell you 
							enough words to convince you that pure water is not 
							clear? Yet that is what many home-based makers of 
							colloidal silver claim. Instead, they will claim 
							colloidal silver must be the color of what they are 
							selling. Other merchants simply will not say. On our 
							Truth About Colloidal Silver page we explain why 
							what they are selling is not clear.
 
     
							True colloidal silver is clear for obvious reasons:
							
     1. Pure water is clear
     2. Colloidal particles 
							are too small to see. If you can see the particles 
							they are massively too large to be colloidal or of 
							any benefit
     3. Even if you could see the silver, 
							silver in its natural for is gray, not brown, tan, 
							yellow or green.
     4. If stabilized it also if 
							reflective. This also means no color. 
 

     On our 
							Truth About 
							Colloidal Silver page we explain why what they are 
							selling is not clear, meaning what other than silver 
							actually in the bottle. If you are on a website and 
							there are excuses for why there is a tint to their 
							colloidal silver, we strongly urge you to pass that 
							one by as it can not possibly be pure colloidal 
							silver.

									Comparing Prices 
									Based On Colloidal Silver Content





 
      
							For the comparison chart below, we accept their claimed 
							ppm level, though in fact that is rarely even close 
							to accurate.
							Most merchants hope people price based upon the 
							ounces of liquid in the bottle, not the amount of 
							colloidal silver in the bottle. Yet it is only the 
							amount of colloidal silver that matters, not how 
							much water in the bottle.  

     Remember, it is the 
							ppm level that matters because all the rest is just 
							water. With extremely weak colloidal silver content they 
							then put their money instead into marketing and 
							advertising. Their home-making little systems can 
							not make high concentration silver solution - 
							colloidal or otherwise. So they have to put their 
							efforts into marketing instead because they are 
							mostly just selling bottles of water. The chart below shows the actual cost effect 
							of competitor's dilution levels. There is no 
							reasonable justification for the extreme pricing for 
							how diluted and weak their products are.



     
							For actual colloidal silver content, they are 
							charging 1500% to over 3000% more, because they are 
							mostly selling bottles of water. 



   
    
							Below is a comparison of top advertisers and a 
							sampling of other home-based products labeled and 
							sold as colloidal silver:

Note: The

							PPM level is based upon the product label claim of 
							level of colloidal silver content. ** Price is 
							based upon the advertised price of 1 quart, 
							calculated at cost per 10ppm per ounce. This method 
							of calculation is based upon the claimed amount of 
							silver, not the volume of water. How many ounces of 
							water are in the bottle is irrelevant to the amount 
							of colloidal silver.*** Price 
							of Sovereign Silver(TM)
							is based upon the above ** and Amazon price 
							as of April 29, 2017For any product identified 
							above the merchant or producer is welcome to advise 
							of any error on the chart and/or to advise of 
							updated pricing or ppm level as appears on the 
							label.


The price comparison for 
							actual claimed Colloidal Silver Content is dramatic



      
							Their small scale single stage units have little 
							production capacity nor can produce high 
							concentration. A small scale home-made or micro-size 
							single stage production system inherently can not 
							produce high volume or high concentration. 
							Since they can not manufacture concentrated 
							colloidal silver (or real colloidal silver at all), 
							they put their efforts into marketing looking for 
							customers would only look at how much liquid is in 
							the bottle, not how much ingredient is in that 
							water. 


WARNING ABOUT "ULTRA 
							SILVER"






 

 
      
							We do not 
									hesitate to 
									advise that "Ultra Silver Colloidal Silver" 
									is a 100% deceptive product in that it is 
									not colloidal silver, but what is called 
									"protein silver." Ultra Silver claims 
									concentrations as high as 10,000ppm - which 
									is impossible as water could not hold as 
									much silver in suspension - and on the 
									ingredients he states the bottle contains an 
									unidentified "protein." Silver is a metal, 
									not a protein. 
      
									There are over a million different 
									"proteins" so "protein" is an ingredient 
									would be the same as posting an ingredient 
									is "carbohydrate" or "liquid." Some proteins 
									are among the deadly poisons on earth. 
									"Protein silver" is simply putting silver 
									powder in a "protein." Not all proteins are 
									safe.  
									The powder is the size of boulders to your 
									cells. Even if a non-toxic protein, protein 
									silver is worthless for health, no different 
									than rubbing a sterling silver teaspoon 
									against your skin, other than it is worse 
									since you are to swallow it.     For this 
									deceptive product he charges as much as 
									$399.95 per quart and $149.95 for 4 ounces.* This is virtually a pure 
									profit for which he massive spends on 
									advertising hoping a few people falls for 
									this deception. He also urges people to buy 
									it and dilute it, and sell it online for a 
									profit, so much of what is offered online is 
									this worthless and deceptive protein silver 
									falsely sold as colloidal silver. 

 
     Follow 
									this link to the ingredients statement off 
									their website, though since have been 
									replacing the ingredients statement to 
									delete reference to "protein." Again, silver 
									is not a protein and there is no protein in 
									colloidal silver, nor does he even state 
									what the "protein" is. His website also 
									makes unsupportable health benefits claims.
      
									Please help spread this warning. It is this 
									extreme level of deception that tends to 
									lead to government bans, including of the 
									legitimate products.
 
Don't 
									just take our word for it, click here and we 
									prove this warning is accurate:

Merchants occasionally add a small token of appreciation

						But it is a nice thought. We decided to add a small

						value. The 50 cent piece is worth 50 cents and the 
						silver dollar is worth a dollar.  
"A dollar saved is

Guardian Of Eden's
Rocket 88 
													has never been available 
													before for general public 
													sale. In private sales it 
													generally sells for over $10 per 
													ounce and with a waiting 
													list. Production takes 
													approximately 3 months. There is no other

													like it. Some claim it is 
													one of the most effective 
													and fully natural health 
													supplements ever made as it 
													addresses core cellular 
													health in ways no other 
													product can.
 
      
													Explaining this

													specifics. 

 
      
													We are strictly limiting 
													sale of Rocket 88 to 1 per

													We have only a very small 
													number of this product and 
													we would like to give as

													this. When sold out this

											This meter will tell you.

Pure (.999) Silver Bullion Drops Add-On*
*Only Available With Order of Colloidal Silver


     

We will add 1/4th or 1/2 ounce of pure (.999) Silver Bullion Drops to your Colloidal Silver bottle. True Colloidal silver enthusiasts kept silver bullion drops in their bottles of Colloidal Silver claiming this preserves the correct ionization and magnetic traits to the silver nano-particles. Guardian Of Eden stores their colloidal silver also with silver bullion drops. While not necessary, this is an option we offer. 
			   

     
			  
Note: The silver bullion drops mix range in size from about 1/20th to twice the size of BBs. To get an idea of how much 1/2 ounce of silver is, an American Silver dollar weights precisely 1 full ounce. We simply add the silver shot bullion to your bottle's contents.* ALL orders are filled PER ORDER and ALL are tested for PPM level immediately prior to filling. Because the smaller drops are very light, they are not easily removed from the bottle unless allowed to entirely dry.
 
*We had too many problems with a tiny bag of silver shot included with orders as it was too easily lost in the packaging. A small sticker will be on your bottle indicating it has 1/4 or 1/2 ounces of .999 Silver bullion shot added to the contents.

What to Watch for to avoid INTERNET FRAUD on Colloidal Products
						And why this is so important
 

 


According to a study by the F.D.A. over 80% of all health and dietary supplements now sold online do not contain 
									ANY of the claimed ingredients. 
									 


 
     
							Modern website templates allow anyone to make it 
							look like they are a real company. People who are 
							not familiar with constructing websites do not 
							realize there are free website templates show 
							employees, laboratories, facilities, clients and 
							customers and more - all fake. Many are high school 
							and college kids who are computer savvy. It is a 
							money-making game to them. They may take pictures from Google Images, claiming this is who they are, claim to be doctors, PhDs, biochemists or any other claim.
 


 EXAMPLES OF WHAT TO BEWARE OF REGARDING 
							COLLOIDAL SILVER: 
1. They claim to have 500ppm and higher colloidal 
							silver. This is worthless "protein silver" which is 
							just mixing silver powder with gelatin. It has no 
							beneficial value whatsoever and is 100% worthless.
 

2. The seller makes up some other name for what they are selling like 
							Super Silver, MessaSilver, MaxiSilver, AtomSilver, 
							Nano Silver, UltramaxSilver, etc - 
							and then bizarrely brag they are the only person/company selling it. It bizarre because it is a non-existence substance for a name they just made up - they claim they are the only one selling it 
							(when there is no such thing as what they claim they are selling.) 
							If they are selling Colloidal Silver, why would they 
							call it something else?   
							
 

Some of such 
							websites are massively voluminous to link after link 
							of studies, details and descriptions - all as 
							diversion. It is as if you were reading pages and 
							pages about diamonds, with the seller hoping you do 
							not notice the person is selling "real genuine 
							diamondite," meaning it is not a diamond at all. 
							Does the seller tell you the actual ingredients? 
							Does it have "protein?" NO colloidal silver has 
							"protein." Silver and water are not organic. Protein 
							is. Or why does the seller not call it colloidal 
							silver, though talks about colloidal silver?
 

3. They also sell other EXTREMELY health destructive products also called Colloidal. For example, colloidal palladium* and 
							colloidal platinum** are EXTREMELY health destructive! Iridium is another example. Anyone who would try to sell you products that destroy human health are SO horrific why would you possibly believe their Colloidal Silver is legitimate. Other examples include claiming they are selling colloidal silica, colloidal zinc and colloidal - or sticking the word 
							colloidal in front of anything else they can think of, and then claiming amazing health benefits.
 

It is hard to believe anyone 
							would sell a product known to damage a person's health, isn't it? Most likely their rational is that since all they REALLY are selling is probably bottles of water anyway they are only stealing from you, not killing you. Thieves do not care about you. They only care about your money. If they can convince you to buy a bottle of water with anything in it to show on a ppm meter, they will do it.

 

4. They claim laboratory tests PROVE their product. Anyone can doctor up a lab report or buy a legitimate product and have it tested, and then claim that is what they are selling.

 

5. Testimonials. Anyone can make up testimonials. Unless they provide the names, addresses and phone numbers of such people testimonials are worthless.

 
 * Palladium
							
is highly toxic (poisonous) and is 
							a known carcinogenic (causes cancers) and 
							can permanently damage cellular DNA.
							
 ** Platinum is toxic and causes life 
							threatening and permanent bone 
							marrow, liver and kidney damage.
 




 
Is our colloidal silver more expensive?

 


     
						No. Even without 
						this super discount sale it is FAR less costly than the fake solutions sold online 
						due to how concentrated it is. 
 
 
						             Why you should not buy homemade colloidal silver 
						sold online even if on a credible looking website:
     There is a clear irony and surprising the contradictions you find by those selling the fake colloidal silver and also selling kits to make it. While their prices for fake colloidal silver are extremely high at $100 a gallon or more, at the same time they boast if you buy their kits (usually well over $100), you can make it for pennies a gallon. Do you see the contradiction? If it can be made for a 
						nickel a gallon, why do they charge over $100 a gallon to buy it from them if you don't want to make it yourself?
          			                      	
				    
				
						Seriously, does anyone really 
						believe they can make TRUE colloidal silver for 2 cents a quart? What you know is what they are selling you didn't cost them more than 2 cents a quart to make - probably in their kitchen with one of their own battery charger with a timer on it kits. 



What is the concentration level?




    
						Our colloidal silver is a minimum of 120ppm and gold is a minimum of 100 ppm 
						unless specified otherwise. In addition to be 
						true colloidal silver, it is 
						300% to 500% more concentrated that others claim to be 
						offering and 20 times more effective.





WHY BUY NOW?




      
						Legitimate colloidal silver is virtually impossible to find 
						online anymore. You can find homemade ionic silver 
						people falsely labeled colloidal silver. Colloidal silver has nearly an indefinite shelf life. It never spoils. It may not be publicly available to buy at all soon. 
						There also is a real prospect public sales of colloidal 
						silver will be outlawed as it recently was in all 
						European countries. What we offer is generally 300% 
						to 500% more concentrated than what most offer, meaning 300% 
						to 500% more volume, and it is true colloidal silver. To 
						reduce it merely add distilled water. 1 quart of our 120 
						ppm colloidal silver equals 1 gallon of 30 ppm sold by 
						others.

IS COLLOIDAL SILVER TOXIC?

 


                        
                   
                    There are no instances of anyone suffering any adverse health affects from any level of usage 
						of colloidal silver.   

 

 TRIVIA FACT 


      
								Did you know that N.A.S.A. uses colloidal 
						silver to purify water abort the International Space 
						Station? With limited water onboard due to it's 
						weight to put into space, for drinking water urine is 
						purified and recycled. Part of the process involves 
						colloidal silver as it will kill biological contaminates 
						and organisms other sterilizing additions do not and it 
						is 100% safe. This is how powerful and yet safe 
								REAL Colloidal Silver is.










                                      WHAT IS THE SHELF LIFE OF LEGITMATE 
						COLLOIDAL SILVER?
Virtually forever as it does not spoil.
				Stock up before sales are banned.        



     The shelf life of true Colloidal Silver is virtually forever. The shelf life of our capped colloidal 
						silver is centuries if not seriously contaminated. 
						If not refrigerated, colloidal gold by itself can spoil by the 
						water going bad in about 2 years. But true concentrated colloidal silver will never spoil, weaken or expire. So you should stock some if you suspect you may ever want it in the future. 
	  					
 





Why Concentration (ppms) Matter In 
					  Figuring ACTUAL Price





 





 

 









Remember, when 
							  you are buying Colloidal Silver, you are buying 
							  ppms, not bottle volume. 
 The 
							  medium for Colloidal Silver is pure (distilled) 
							  water.  A QUART of 120ppm Colloidal Silver equals 
							  a GALLON of 30ppm Colloidal Silver. To reduce it 
							  to 30ppm (if you wish, or just use less drops), 
							  simply add 3 times as much distilled water and you 
							  have 1 gallon of 30ppm Colloidal Silver for the 
							  price of 1 quart. 1 quart of 120ppm Colloidal 
							  Silver equals 1 1/2 gallons of 20ppm Colloidal 
							  Silver.






     

 One quart of our 120ppm Colloidal Silver equals 1 Gallon of what other claim is 30ppm Colloidal Silver, with a gallon of 30ppm Colloidal silver 
						  being sold for as much as over $200 per gallon. Our 
						  sales price is an extreme & temporary price reduction sale 
						  that Colloidal Silver enthusiasts will recognize. 
						  Hopefully you do too.
 

     
					  HOW TO DILUTE 120ppm TO 30ppm if wish to? It is 
						  simple! To dilute a quart of our 120ppm Colloidal silver to 30ppm Colloidal silver, simply pour the quart of Colloidal Silver 120ppm into a CLEAN gallon container and fill the rest ;with distilled water (not tap or mineral water). 
						  You have 1 gallon of TRUE 30ppm Colloidal for less than 1/4th others are selling what they claim is 30ppm Colloidal Silver. Regardless of the 
						  quantity you wish to reduce, it is simply adding 3 
						  times as much distilled water to reduce 
						  120ppm to 30ppm. Or just use 1/4th as many drops if 
						  you are using a dropper for measuring personal 
						  usage.   

    Useful 
						  Trivia:
            		                        	There are 
						  approximate 300 drops per ounce of water with our 
				    droppers included FREE with your purchase.





 

Bulk/Wholesale Sale on Colloidal Silver

120ppm Colloidal Silver By The Gallon



    
This EXTREME and temporary sales 
price is 70% to 80% less than what others currently charge. The reason is they 
are claiming 30ppm concentration. With this sale, our Colloidal Silver is 120ppm 
concentration which is 400% more concentrated.



    

Currently, 30ppm Colloidal Silver is being sold elsewhere for as much as over $200 per gallon with the method it was produced kept secret. Our 120ppm Colloidal Silver is 400% more concentrated. One gallon of our 120ppm Colloidal Silver equals FOUR GALLONS of 30ppm Colloidal Silver. To make 1 gallon of our 120ppm Colloidal Silver equal 4 gallons of 30ppm Colloidal Silver, simply add 3 parts DISTILLED water to our 120ppm Colloidal Silver. Stir or shake well and you have 30ppm Colloidal Silver - and our 
	colloidal silver is TRUE Colloidal Silver.

    
Gallon containers arrive in an appropriate white chemical resistant jug. You can replace it with glass containers upon receiving it if you wish.  Unlike our 8 to 32 ounce bottles, our gallon jug labels only contain a line for you to write the date you received it for your own record. Unless EXTREMELY contaminated, TRUE Colloidal Silver will NEVER spoil or weaken. With long term shortage, you may wish to shake the bottle.



     REPACKAGERS: If you repackage Colloidal Silver for 
	Retail Sales and would like to offer LEGTIMATE 30ppm or less Colloidal 
	Silver, this is your chance to do so, while allowing yourself a fair margin 
	of profit.


THESE EXTREMELY REDUCED SALE PRICES WILL NOT LAST LONG.
We STRONGLY 
	suggest buying a gallon.

What Is 
						Colloidal Gold? 


     
						The most simple definition is microscopic size gold 
						molecule clusters suspended in pure water by water 
						tension (the "sticky" nature of water (h2o).





















 

















Why Colloidal Gold?


      Many ancient cultures 
				pursued gold for its spiritual benefits. The Conquistadors 
				pursued the trails of gold all though the Andes looking for El 
				Dorado and the Fountain of Youth. El Dorado literally means “the 
				Golden One.” The people of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Israel 
				possessed knowledge of an alchemical process to not only make 
				gold from lower elements (the Philosopher’s Stone), but also to 
				transform gold into a high-spun, monatomic state, which was used 
				to attain higher sates of consciousness.
 
      Gold is one of the absolute best conductors of 
				electricity. For this reason, some believe it is beneficial to 
				nerve and brain function. However, this is controversial and not 
				agreed upon. Critically, Colloidal Gold prepared improperly can 
				damage nerves - why it is a dangerous product to buy from anyone 
				making in their garage or kitchen, despite how professional 
				their website and bottle label looks. 
 
				      On the more practical 
				side of things, Colloidal Gold uses are varied and many. 
				Scientists have used Colloidal Gold as a cell maker as it 
				naturally stimulates cellular growth. 


Correct Color of Colloidal 
				Gold?




     
				Colloidal Gold's color is directly related 
				to the size of the particles in the water. Smaller particles 
				(Good Colloidal Gold) will appear to be a deep red color while 
				larger particles (useless) will appear anywhere from purple to 
				blue to a light gray color.
 
     The color matters also greatly in terms of safety. If 
				it is not red color that means it was not manufactured correctly 
				and this does poise a serious health damage risk. 
 
				    
				Our Colloidal Gold is pure, of the correct particle size and contains 
				no added color, fillers or other fake ingredients to increase 
				PPM count. We are a major health products supply company since 
				1983. You can trust our quality and the legitimacy of our 
				products. 


 


USAGE INFORMATION 


 DIRECTIONS: Gently shake 
				bottle before opening. Put 4 to 8 drops under tongue for 10 to 
				30 seconds and then swallow, 2 to 3 times a day. Alternatively 
				you may put 8 ounces in water and swallow. You may do so at 
				mealtime or not. 
 
PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION: Do NOT take 
				within 1 hour of taking prescription medication and eat 
				something (such as a couple of crackers) before taking 
				prescription medication if you are using Colloidal Gold. 
 
STORAGE: Unlike REAL Colloidal Silver which 
				will never spoil or weaken, Colloidal Gold has the same 
				spoilage/fouling nature as pure water - meaning it can become 
				contaminated and "spoiled." For this 
				reason, Colloidal Gold should be 
				refrigerated. Generally it has a 2 
				year shelf life if refrigerated.
 
FREEZING COLLOIDAL GOLD? Yes, you can freeze it 
				to greatly extend its storage life. However, be careful as 
				sometimes plastic bottles will burst if full and frozen. You 
				best chance to avoid this is to not have the bottle too full and 
				lay it on its side (after you insure the cap seal is not 
				leaking.) This allows the expanding freezing water more 
				space to expand.
				When you thaw it out put it in a large enough outer bowl to 
				catch the liquid if the bottle was cracked when frozen. 
 
Will Colloidal Gold Weaken 
				Over time? 
Very slightly. Gold is much heavier 
				than water and is soft. It can somewhat start to settle with 
				some collecting on the bottom. Being soft, some of the 
				microscopic particles may somewhat stick together. While no gold 
				is lost, that tiny amount is less effective.
				Gently shaking the bottle for a 
				second will reverse this. 

How To Extend Storage Life of Colloidal Gold? 
In addition to freezing it, you can 
				combine it with Colloidal Silver.  Colloidal Silver 
				will destroy essentially any bacteria and fungus and therefore 
				virtually will never spoil or weaken. Colloidal Gold has no 
				biocidal properties - allowing it - like bottled water - to "go 
				bad" eventually. Adding Colloidal Silver to Colloidal Gold 
				significantly increases the storage life. The higher percentage 
				of Colloidal Silver, the longer then non-frozen storage life is 
				extended. We offer a 50/50 Colloidal Silver and Colloidal Gold 
				Mix down another webpage found
				here.
