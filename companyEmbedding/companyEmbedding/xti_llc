I need to return rack being I am returning the damaged product I was to going to use it with. I was informed I would be receiving a return of $ 5.96 , after I purchased the product for $16.99 plus taxes. This is unacceptable and ridculous. I cancelled the return, as you wanted me to, offering me such a low refund.  I will never do business with your company again and will leave a review as to why.

 MAG's new XTi "super profiler" takes aerospace machining to a reportedly record altitude, demonstrating a 90-cubic-inch-per-minute metal removal rate (MRR) in titanium prior to shipment to Aerospace Dynamics International, Inc. (ADI), Valencia, California. The machines are part of a $100 million expansion that includes a new 120,000-sq-ft manufacturing center. The two machines will share a 120-foot X-axis rail for multi-part production of titanium components for the Boeing 777 and 787, and Airbus A350.    According to Chip Storie, MAG Executive Vice President, the 3-axis, 5-spindle XTi profiler is engineered and built for maximum dynamic stiffness and sustained power in titanium roughing operations to meet ADI's aggressive processing requirements. "ADI's goal was to set a new standard for producing titanium parts at the lowest cost per piece, and the XTi Profiler provides that capability and more," he emphasized. "This machine is in a performance class by itself, equipped with a massive cross rail and robust spindle design that enable it to perform at this high rate on a sustained basis."    ADI President and CEO John Cave added: "This is the stiffest profiler we've ever seen in action. We typically rough machine Ti 6A14V with a radial depth of cut (RDOC) of 0.38 inch and axial depth of cut (ADOC) of 1.5 to 2.5 inches. During our visit we had MAG machine an angular channel in titanium, with 4.0 inch axial depth and a 1.5 inch radial depth. We were impressed at the ease with which these cuts were made. The machine peeled off perfect '6-shaped' chips with no chatter or sign of structural instability. The part finish was excellent. It was a remarkable demonstration and exceeded our expectations, giving us confidence as we move forward with plans for the new 5-axis model of the XTi."    The XTi profiler uses five spindle motors capable of up to 3500 rpm, each rated 51 kW (68 hp) and producing 2523 Nm (1860 ft lb) of torque. The machine is engineered with a new spindle support structure that is incorporated into an extremely stiff, heavyweight gantry for superior damping. The massive cross rail is 77 percent larger than previous designs, providing added stiffness, rigidity and damping for high-horsepower, chatter-free machining. To handle that power and torque, the ADI profilers are equipped with 60-taper tools for highly efficient roughing and finishing operations.    The XTi is available with HSK 125A tool interface as an option. Five 6-pocket tool exchangers, located at each end of the work zone, permit five tool exchanges per machine. X-axis motion is powered by rack-and-pinion drives on both rails, while Y and Z axes are driven by large-diameter ballscrews, with a counterbalance and brake on the Z. The two new 5-spindle XTi profilers join 32 other mostly MAG profilers at ADI.    "Our business is growing, and we need manufacturing capacity to keep pace with the strong market," Cave added. "Five-spindle profilers give us a significant competitive advantage."

Spray Master Technologies

Commercial Pressure Wash Cleaning Equipment 






                SMT incorporates the highest quality components and design for exceptional cleaning in large facilities while saving labor, chemicals, water, and money. Our experience with pressure washers began in the mid 1960's, when Mr. William Sage was working for his father's pressure washing company in Southern California. Much like a central vacuum operates in a home, the central pressure washer allows operators to clean from multiple remote stations, located conveniently throughout their facilities, all while the pump is housed quietly away.  
            

                We provide high quality pressure washers to restaurants (both fine dining and quick service), hotels, schools, hospitals, convenience stores, animal care facilities, nursing homes, and even residences.

The History of APC
Assembled Products Corporation was founded by Mr. William Sage
 Manufacturing Marvels Features Assembled Products Corp.




Mart Cart

While helping to care for his elderly grandmother in the early 1980's, Mr. William Sage noticed how difficult it was for Grandmother to do her grocery shopping; or even to accompany the family during their shopping trips. Mr. Sage didn't waste any time.  He took out a napkin, as it was the only suitable drawing medium available, and started drawing concept ideas for the first electric shopping cart.  The Mart Cart was born.  Soon after, Mr. Sage began producing the first electric shopping cart in a small facility in Rogers, Arkansas. 

In the beginning, electric shopping carts were unheard of in grocery stores.  Managers were reluctant to purchase the new device, saying, "They'll be racing up and down the aisles!"  But Mr. Sage, in his wisdom, had designed the carts to move at a shopper's pace, a walking pace of only 2 miles per hour.  Once the first grocery store manager was convinced that the carts would not only be a benefit to his current shoppers, but also bring new shoppers, the Mart Cart idea spread quickly among shoppers and store managers alike.  Shoppers would drive for miles, past one, two, or even three, of their local stores to find a store with a Mart Cart. 

In the first years, few carts were sold each month to stores, one by one.  Today, Mart Cart builds and ships several thousand carts each year, meeting the needs of many Fortune 500 grocery, drug, variety, and specialty merchandise stores.  Across America and around the world, a fleet of over 100,000 carts serve shoppers daily in one of life's most necessary tasks.
                

Go Jotto

Since 1994 Jotto Desk, a business unit of Assembled Products T Corporation of Rogers, Arkansas, has been innovating and manufacturing laptop computer mounts and equipment consoles for mobile professionals.  First to the market with The Mobile Office DeskR, Jotto Desk has grown its product lines offering individuals, fleet managers and IT professional's solid, best in class solutions for mounting and docking laptop computers in all types of vehicles.  Jotto Desk products are used in public safety, homeland security, military, infrastructure, sales, service and transportation fleets in small to large businesses.  

In 2006, Jotto Desk re-defined cargo management with the Jotto-Cargo Slide, a line of truck and SUV cargo slides that provide easy access to cargo in the bed of the vehicle.  In early 2009 Kodiak Mobile, a 16 year veteran manufacture of mobile docking stations was added providing entry into mobile electronics.  Kodiak Docking stations are turn-key solutions totally automated with "intelligent power management systems, charging and many laptop protections.  The addition of Patriot Products to the Jotto Desk offering makes Jotto Desk the first Total Solutions Provider in public safety equipment. 
                


Hub Motors

The XTi® Hub Motor currently powers over 40,000 Mart Carts in service today. This innovative, patented, motor-in-a-wheel provides front wheel drive for the versatile shopping carts and can easily transport 750 lbs. The Hub Motor is a combination of five major components: motor, gears, electric brake, hub and tire. The motor uses the newest in printed disk technology and is a 24-volt DC brush permanent magnet motor. It utilizes a steel primary/secondary gear system with a unique shock absorbing motor-to-gear coupler. The brake is a friction disk type brake, which is electrically disengaged (at 24 volts DC) by the PWM (pulse-width-modulator) controller as power is applied to the motor. The rotating aluminum hub, with a bonded non-marking tire, encases all of the motor's components. In 2003, Hub Motors won the INNOVA Award presented by Webcom Communications Corp.
                








 Spray Master Technologies
Spray Master Technologies is the world's highest quality pressure washing system available. Each design, including the unique central system configuration, incorporates the highest quality components and design for exceptional cleaning in large facilities while saving labor, chemicals, water, and money. Our experience with pressure washers began in the mid 1960's, when Mr. William Sage was working for his father's pressure washing company in Southern California. After twenty years under his father's tutillage, Mr. Sage's father passed away. Mr. Sage went to work soon after, improved on his father's designs, and began his own pressure washing company. Growth was slow in the first years, but the unique central pressure washing system could not be ignored. Much like a central vacuum operates in a home, the central pressure washer allows operators to clean from multiple remote stations, located conveniently throughout their facilities, all while the pump is housed quietly away. Now SMT Cleans the World!™, providing high quality pressure washers to restaurants (both fine dining and quick service), hotels, schools, hospitals, convenience stores, animal care facilities, nursing homes, and even residences.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
