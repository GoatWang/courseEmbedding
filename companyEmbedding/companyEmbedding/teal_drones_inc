Rahul Aggarwal   The Teal won’t just slice through the air at high speeds, it can also withstand strong winds of up to 40 mph, so you can fly it even in less-than-ideal conditions. An onboard camera allows it to shoot 13 megapixel stills and 4K video at 24fps, all while streaming real-time video in 720p, although it relies strictly on electronic image stabilization to keep its video smooth. It comes with two battery options, one for 10 minutes of flight time and another for 20 minutes, although the max speeds can only be reached using the lightweight 10-minute battery.A Nvidia Jetson TX1 powers the drone’s intelligent systems, with an accompanying SDK allowing you to customize it with your own scripts. Features include an integrated GPS, an app-based flight controller, a 4.8:1 thrust-to-weight ratio, and a maximum range of 5,000 feet using a 2.4GHz controller.

Terms and Conditions of Sale

PRIVACY POLICY
WARRANTIES AND RETURNS
WEBSITE TERMS OF USE
 
Pre-Orders
Last Updated: July 2016
Please read these Terms and Conditions of Sale (these “Terms”) carefully because they govern the purchase of any products (“Products”) you buy from Teal Drones, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Teal Drones,” “us” or “we”), during our “pre-order” period commencing on July 20, 2016 at 9:00 a.m. EDT, and any services (the “Services”) you receive from us, unless you have signed a separate written agreement with us that explicitly supersedes these Terms. Any software installed in our Products or offered with our Products is licensed to you, not sold. You may only use this software for its normal, intended use with our Products and in accordance with the Software License section below. When we say “sell” and “purchase” in these Terms, we mean “sell” and “purchase” only with respect to the non-software elements of the Product. These Terms apply whether or not they are included with the Products sold hereunder.
PRE-ORDERS
We are conducting pre-orders for our Teal™ Product whereby we are taking advance orders to be shipped at a future date (“Pre-Orders”). To secure a Pre-Order for the Teal™, you will be required to provide us with payment information (e.g., your credit or debit card number and associated billing address and card security information) at the time you place the order. You will not be charged at the time of your Pre-Order, but we reserve the right to authorize your credit or debit card for the amount of your Pre-Order. We will charge the full amount of your Pre-Order, including the cost of shipping and handling and any applicable sales or use taxes we may be required to collect on your order, at the time of shipment of your order. We will contact you prior to the expected ship date of your order to notify you of the estimated shipment date for your order.
If you want to pre-order the Teal™, simply click on the “Pre-Order” button and follow the on-screen directions. Once you place your pre-order, we will email you with a pre-order confirmation (“Pre-Order Confirmation”) that indicates we have received your Pre-Order. We are not bound to sell you any Product until we have accepted and processed your payment which, for Pre-Orders, will not be until we ship your order. With your Pre-Order Confirmation, we will confirm the quantity of Products you purchased and their price. Our acceptance of your order is expressly conditioned on your unconditional acceptance of these Terms, even if you communicate with us otherwise. We do not accept any changes to or rejections of these Terms that you may communicate to us in any form and all such terms and conditions will be null and of no effect. The terms of our Warranty and Return Program apply to any purchase and are incorporated herein by reference.
ORDER CANCELLATION
You may cancel your order any time before your purchased Product ships and, if your payment has already been processed, receive a full refund. To cancel your Order, please contact us at hello@tealdrones.com.
SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY
We may provide a single shipping method and carrier, or multiple methods and carriers, for Product delivery, at our sole discretion. You will be responsible for all freight, packing, insurance and other shipping-related costs and expenses, and these will be noted on your order screen before you make your pre-order. Once the Product is delivered to the carrier at our premises, ownership of the Product and the risk of that Product’s loss or damage passes to you.
You understand that all scheduled shipment dates and estimated shipment dates are estimates only. We will make reasonable efforts to meet the scheduled shipment dates, but in no event will we be liable for any loss, damage, or penalty resulting from any delay in shipment or delivery, nor will the carrier be deemed our agent. If you purchase multiple Products, we may send you your Products in installments and charge you separately for each installment. We have the right to allocate our available inventory of the Products among other purchasers in such manner as we see fit. If we are not able to charge your payment method or you fail to pay for your purchase, we have the right to delay or suspend shipment of the Products.
PRICES AND TAXES
The prices for the Products will be as specified during checkout and in your Order Confirmation. Prices are stated in U.S. dollars and, for residents of Utah only, with a separate subtotal for the applicable sales tax for purchases made within Utah. For residents of Utah, we will add the applicable sales tax to your order and collect such tax as part of your payment for your order at the time your order ships. For all non-Utah residents, you agree to pay the applicable sales tax relating to the Products you purchase from us. You (including Utah residents) are also responsible for any other taxes imposed by you in connection with your purchase and use of the Product.
ELIGIBILITY
YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS. By purchasing or ordering the Product, you represent and warrant that: (i) you are 18 years of age or older; (ii) any Order information you submit to us is truthful and accurate; (iii) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; and (iv) your use of the Product or our Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation. We may refuse a sale of a Product or access to its Services to anyone at any time, in its sole discretion for any or no reason.
INDEMNITY
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Teal Drones, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected to your violation of these Terms and for liabilities, interest, penalties or fees assessed against us arising from any failure by you to pay any required taxes.
LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
SUBJECT TO OUR WARRANTY AND RETURNS PROGRAM, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS AND YOUR USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND IN NO EVENT WILL TEAL DRONES BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF REVENUE, USE, PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL) OR COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE PURCHASE, SALE, USE, OPERATION OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT TEAL DRONES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. YOU AND TEAL DRONES AGREE THAT THESE LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THESE TERMS IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL TEAL DRONES’ LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE ACTUAL AMOUNT PAID TO TEAL DRONES BY YOU FOR THE PRODUCT AND SERVICES THAT GIVES RISE TO THE CLAIM.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
SOFTWARE LICENSE
Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Teal Drones grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to use the software in the Product (the “Software”), as part of your use of the Product for your own personal, non-commercial purposes and for no other purposes. You may not (i) copy, modify or create derivative works based on the Software; (ii) distribute, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend or rent the Software to any third party; (iii) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software; or (iv) make the functionality of the Software available to multiple users through any means. Teal Drones reserves all rights in and to the Software not expressly granted to you under these Terms. All Software is protected by U.S. copyright law and international treaties.
PRIVACY POLICY
You understand that any information provided by you or collected by us in connection with your use of our website, the Products and our Services will be used in the manner described in these Terms of Use and in our Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which is available at [___________]. The Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into and made a part of these Terms. If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy, you may not use the Services.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
Agreement to Arbitrate. For any dispute with Teal Drones, you agree to first contact us at legal@tealdrones.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Teal Drones has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after thirty (30) days, you and Teal Drones agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Product (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”); and (iii) you retain the right to litigate any Dispute other than an IP Protection Action by providing Teal Drones with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at our contact information at the bottom of these Terms within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you do not provide Teal Drones with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Teal Drones with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in Salt Lake City, UT and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide Teal Drones with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and Teal Drones are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Teal Drones otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.
Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820 and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822). The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Teal Drones otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Teal Drones submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Teal Drones will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Teal Drones will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
Changes. If Teal Drones changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date on which you placed your order for a Product, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to legal@tealdrones.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Teal Drones’ email to you notifying you of such change.

Teal is more than just another quadcopter: It's a platform.As it stands in 2016, consumers can pick out a ready-to-fly drone for aerial photos and video or for racing or just to fly casually. Teal is meant to appeal to all of these buyers, regardless of skill level, and eventually to commercial pilots, too.Behind Teal -- the company and the drone -- is 18-year old George Matus who has been flying quads since he was 11 and built his first one at 14. The drone is the result of an evolving list of dream features he's been making since then.The quad can go fast at up to 70 mph (112 kph) in up to 40 mph (64 kph) winds, it's weatherproof, can be controlled with an iOS or Android device or a regular radio controller and is small enough to slip into backpack. In front is an electronically stabilized 13-megapixel camera that can record video at 4K resolution.Teal is also modular, and that doesn't only mean removing the battery. Each arm can be popped on and off, as can the drone's top section. With other drones, if you were to break one of the prop arms you would have to send the whole thing in for repair. With Teal you'll be able to easily replace it on your own. Plus, this opens the possibility for specialized arms for specific tasks. Teal is also currently planning to release modules for the top section including thermal imaging, obstacle avoidance (something it currently can't do on its own) and a secondary camera for first-person-view racing.Here's where it gets even more interesting, though. Inside Teal is a minicomputer powered by an Nvidia Jetson TX1 quad-core processor to handle machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. The idea here is that by having the modular design, powerful hardware running the drone's Teal OS as well as making an SDK available, it can be a platform to be developed for consumer and commercial uses.For the moment the drone is targeted at consumers and will have three apps available at launch: one for flight control, another for a Follow-Me mode for automatic subject tracking and a racing application so you can compete against other Teal pilots. Matus hopes after an app store has been built and grows, that licensing of the platform with other hardware manufacturers will soon follow.The biggest downsides we see are the same things we see with a lot of drones: battery life and price. Teal has a 1,800mAh lithium polymer battery that will provide around 10 minutes of flight time. This is shorter than larger camera drones, but is in line with most racing drones. Teal should be releasing extended batteries at some point after launch, too. The other issue is that Teal is a new comer and at $1,299 the unit is not cheap and it is far off with the earliest units shipping right before Christmas 2016. While the rest of the orders placed by August 15, should ship by early 2017, which is quite some time. And that's if all goes according to plan. 

 The company is accepting preorders on Teal Drones site and you won't be charged until the drone ships.

Marine Corps Set to Deploy Next-Generation Unmanned Aircraft  

	Featuring: Philip Finnegan 



 


As far as nano-UAVs, there are a growing number of products in the marketplace for the Marine Corps to choose from, said Phil Finnegan, an analyst with the Teal Group.
A Norwegian company, ProxDynamics, is offering a palm-sized miniature helicopter, the PD-100 T Black Hornet, which can fly with an electro-optical camera and thermal sensor provided by FLIR Systems Inc. for night operations. U.K. forces, and possibly U.S. Special Operations Command, have purchased some of the mini-copters, Finnegan said.
Nano-UAVs "definitely [are] a rapidly growing market. That being said, the [contract] value is nowhere near those of the larger systems," he added.

FAA’s Failure to Regulate U.S. Drone Boom Creates Climate of Confusion 

	Featuring: Philip Finnegan 



 


"It tests the waters and provides some understanding of these systems. Also, from a political standpoint, it helps address some of the concerns in Congress about the ability of U.S. companies to really address this market," said Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at the Teal Group, a leading aerospace and defense market analysis company. "It's a way of providing an interim step before you go out and do the final rule. And the final rule is going to take a long time."
One of the most troublesome issues the FAA must address in its final rule is to outline the differences between using a drone for commercial purposes versus solely for recreation, and then to police drone operators accordingly.
Under current law, for instance, it is technically legal to equip a drone with a camera and snap pictures of a scenic countryside. Selling those pictures, however, is not allowed.
Ironically, that system may have created a situation in which the most responsible operators can't use drones legally while the most irresponsible can.
"It's going to be very difficult for the FAA to control this. Part of the problem is there are severe restrictions on the commercial operation of these, and a lot of those people would be the most responsible," Mr. Finnegan said. "When it comes to hobbyists — no training, dim awareness of the risks — there is very little in terms of limitations. It's a serious, serious problem."

Inside the New Stealth Arsenal 

	Featuring: Philip Finnegan 



 


As military strategists look ahead, the days of asymmetric warfare and the uncontested airspace that comes with it seem to be drawing to a close. "There are no active area defenses run by insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq or, for that matter, Syria," says defense analyst Phil Finnegan, of the Fairfax, Virginia–based Teal Group. "But the next generation of UAVs will have to confront potential threats like China. They'll need to be much more capable—faster, with greater autonomy in case communication links are disrupted, and stealthier so they are more difficult for an adversary to detect."

GoPro Inc's Consumer Drones Could Help Its Stock Take Off 

	Featuring: Philip Finnegan 



 


Research firm Teal Group estimates that global annual spending on drones will nearly double from $6.4 billion to $11.5 billion over the next 10 years. Teal's study shows that military drones currently account for 89% of the market, while civil drones account for the remaining 11%. Yet that split is expected to be 86% military versus 14% civil over the next decade.

Phil Finnegan, a drone expert at the Virginia-based Teal Group, also predicted new jobs on the horizon. "There definitely will be growth of new jobs in the UAS industry as commercial operations begin," he said. "At this point, what everyone is waiting for is the FAA to take steps to begin to open air space and that's going to take time."

The Socom notification is a big deal for the drone industry, said Phil Finnegan, director of corporate analysis for the Teal Group, an aerospace defense consulting firm. "From the industry perspective this is important, because there are very few programs out there," said Finnegan. "Companies are eager not just to get the business, but to get a blue chip customer like Socom."

FAA Approves Drones in Hollywood 

	Featuring: Philip Finnegan 



 


Phil Finnegan, an aviation analyst with the Teal Group, said while the U.S. has led the world in developing the technology behind drones, it's fallen far behind when it comes to letting them fly legally.
"Countries like Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom — a lot of European countries — are going after this market," he says.
It'll take the FAA several years to finalize regulations for all drones, Finnegan says, but he believes this initial move will make the American motion picture industry more competitive on the world stage.

London Drone Contract Could Attract Other Companies 

	Featuring: Philip Finnegan 



 


The global drone aircraft industry will nearly triple in sales over the next 10 years, good news for London’s Diamond Aircraft. The local manufacturer is partnering with American military giant Northrop Grumman to make aerial surveillance aircraft here, the first likely to roll off the line by year’s end. “It is a growth area. If they are offering manned systems they are low cost and in demand around the world and there is a growing appeal,” said Phil Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at Fairfax, Va.,-based aerospace and defense consultancy Teal Group. “If they add unmanned, it increases the potential.” In 2013, the global surveillance aircraft industry was valued at about $3.1 billion a year. By 2022 that will grow to $8.1 billion, he said.

Pakistan Wants Drones, and It Doesn't Need America's Permission to Get Them 

	Featuring: Philip Finnegan 



 


It's probably not a deal-breaker for a country like Pakistan if Chinese drones lack the ability to transmit information, or resolution, the way American-made models do. "The Chinese technology will be less advanced," Phil Finnegan, the director of corporate analysis for Teal Group, says. "But it's a big advance over not having the technology at all." Pakistan may actually get a better deal partnering with China to tailor still-developing technology to its desired range for lethal strikes, and custom-fit weapons it already has for drones.

Industry, Entrepreneurs Await FAA Small Drone Ruling 

	Featuring: Philip Finnegan 



 


While the FAA is facing criticism for ongoing delays, it is a daunting task that takes time, said Phil Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at The Teal Group, a Fairfax, Virginia-based defense and aerospace market analysis firm. “It’s a difficult issue. The FAA is concerned about safety in the airspace, so they are going to go slowly and maybe err on the side of caution,” Finnegan said. “But they need to be assured that this is a safe process. There are a lot of complexities with the technology, and so they are doing a very thorough job. It’s just not easy.” The most that can be hoped for by September 2015 is a plan that will outline gradual steps toward an open airspace, Finnegan said.

FAQs

About Teal

Q.What is Teal?
A.Teal is the world’s fastest production drone. It’s also an extremely powerful computing platform that enables unlimited innovation and applications for drones.
Q.What are some examples of drone applications that the Teal could be used for?
A.Use your imagination! We are in the infancy of the broad applications that drones will be used for. From gaming and augmented reality, security and inspections, e-commerce and agriculture, to purely simplifying and automating drone flight, the opportunities are truly endless. Teal is the only drone designed to be a platform for all of these multiple uses.
Q.What applications will be available at product launch?
A.Command & Control: The main control application for Teal, integrating beginner to advanced modes, live video streaming, waypoint navigation, geofencing, media management, and our built in app store.
Follow-Me: This application will allow Teal to precisely follow a specific person or object based on advanced image recognition that is done real time, onboard the drone. This app is being co-developed with our friends at Neurala, who previously integrated their image recognition algorithms with NASA and The Air Force.
Racing: This app lets pilots race against other Teal users, record flight logs and telemetry, play challenges and win awards, and move up the leaderboard to become one of the best!

Product

Q.How fast can Teal fly?
A.Teal can fly over 70 MPH! We’ve even reached speeds over 85 MPH in certain conditions.
Q.Isn’t it dangerous to have a drone that can fly that fast?
A.Clearly, flying any drone out of control is dangerous, and yes, a high-speed drone can sometimes be more difficult to control for an inexperienced user. For that reason, Teal is built on both the hardware side and software side to make it as safe and easy as possible to fly, while still allowing mind-blowing maneuverability and speed.  Software features include selectable Beginner to Advanced configurations, speed and pitch governing, geofencing, and our Beginner Bubble.
Q.Can I fly Teal in windy conditions?
A.Yes! Unlike other drones, Teal is incredibly stable in wind. It has been flown in winds over 40 MPH while maintaining controllable flight. While caution and judgment is always required when flying in wind, Teal can perform very well in windy conditions.
Q.What is included with Teal?
A.Your order will include Teal, two high-performance flight batteries, a powerful charger, two sets of propellers, expansion cables, and some other surprises. The Signature Series Teal will also include an Endurance Package.
Q.Will it require assembly?
A.Teal will be ready to fly right out of the box! Even the battery will be slightly charged so you can get going right away. You will just need to follow the Quick Start Guide to get flying.
Q.What is the size of Teal?
A.The diagonal motor to motor measurement is 261mm. In other words, Teal is small enough to fit in any standard backpack without disassembly.
Q.What kind of camera is built in?
A.Teal has a 13MP wide field of view camera that supports 4K video recording and 3-axis electronic stabilization. Videos and photos can be stored directly on Teal’s built in 16GB storage, or straight to a microSD card.
Q.Where can I buy replacement arms/propellers?
A.When we start shipping, you will be able to purchase additional parts through our website. We’ve designed Teal to be fully modular and easy to repair yourself.
Q.How long does Teal’s battery last?
A.Under normal usage, the included high-performance flight battery will last about 10 minutes. Yes, that’s less than some other drones; however, we favored having an extremely small, stable, and powerful drone out of the box. With two batteries included, a fast charge time of 30 minutes, and “hot swappable” capability that makes switching batteries easy, you will be able to get plenty of air time. We also have an Endurance Package available that doubles the flight time of Teal to 20 minutes. Since it’s heavier and favors efficiency, it will decrease the top speed and stability of Teal slightly.
Q.How can I check the battery level for my Teal?
A.The LEDs on the back of Teal provide battery status. Our Command & Control application also has a battery indicator. As the battery level starts to get low, you’ll be notified and will be able to select whether you’d like Teal to return to you, or just land in place.
Q.How far away can my Teal fly from me?
A.Range depends on what control method is being used. With just a mobile device over Wi-Fi, Teal can be flown up to 300 feet away. With our Wi-Fi extender (which will be available at time of shipment), range increases to about 2500ft. With an RC transmitter, your range can reach up to 2 miles away.
Q.Can Teal get wet?
A.It’s possible you’ve seen us successfully testing in the rain, and while it is fully enclosed and protected by hydrophobic mesh, it is not waterproof. We don’t support water damage, so we don’t recommend that you submerge it or fly in wet conditions. Not only will this void your warranty, but we also can’t think of why you’d want to put a drone in water…it’s meant for the skies!

Technology

Q.What makes Teal so smart?
A.Teal is powered by the NVIDIA TX1, a crazy powerful mini supercomputer. It handles machine learning, autonomous flight, image recognition, and much more with ease, onboard the drone itself. This makes Teal a flying supercomputer. You can even plug Teal into a monitor, use it like a normal computer, play games on it, and go fly when you want!
Q.Does Teal have obstacle avoidance?
A.Teal does not have standard obstacle avoidance built in. However, we are working on sense and avoid capability that functions directly through the camera that’s already integrated in Teal (via machine learning). We will offer that as a future update. We are also working on upgrade add-on modules that provide more obstacle avoidance capabilities.
Q.Will you be offering an SDK for Teal?
A.Yes, our SDK allows you to build apps that run on Teal, as well as mobile apps to communicate with Teal. We provide full access to the computing power of the TX1, as well as the ability to connect your own hardware through USB ports, so the possibilities are virtually limitless!
Q.What kinds of apps can I make for Teal?
A.What can you imagine? We’re envisioning use cases ranging from advanced autonomous flight, thermal imaging integration, search and rescue, and augmented reality. We think this is just scratching the surface, and we are excited to see the hardware and software you build for Teal!
Q.Tech Specs
A.See our tech specs page for more details.

Payments, Billing, and Shipping

Q.Where can I order Teal?
A.Teal is available exclusively on our website. Currently available only in the USA and Canada.
Q.How much does Teal cost?
A.Teal is available for $1,299.
Q.Why does Teal cost $1299?
A.We didn’t want to take any shortcuts with Teal. We’re using the highest quality parts all around and are manufacturing in the USA. Teal is also the swiss army knife of drones, so you only need one, instead of several different drones, for everything you want to do now or in the future.
Q.Why should I pre-order now?
A.Because being one of the first people to own Teal will make you the coolest kid on the block! Actually, while that’s very true, the real reason is that you will be one of the first people to experience the amazing capabilities and incredible exhilaration of flying Teal.
Q.Do I get charged immediately when I place my pre-order?
A.No, you will not be charged for your Teal until it ships — we don’t think you should pay for a product until it is in your hands! However, be aware that your credit or debit card will be authorized for the payment at the time of the pre-order, so you may see a pending charge or authorization on your card that will disappear after 7-10 days.
Q.How much does shipping cost?
A.Shipping to anywhere in the U.S. and Canada costs $20.
Q.Do you ship internationally?
A.We are currently only accepting orders from the U.S. and Canada.  We expect to add more countries in mid 2017 pending regulatory approvals.

Other

Q.Does Teal offer a Referral Discount?
A.Yes! For every friend that buys a Teal and uses your referral code, you will receive a $50 discount. You may refer as many friends as you would like. To refer a friend, simply have them place an order through the link that you will receive in your order confirmation email that you receive after placing your order. You also will receive the link in the post-confirmation screen after you order, and you can easily share it from there via email.
Q.How can I become a Beta Tester for Teal?
A.Go ahead and send us an email at hello@tealdrones.com for more information!

A.We can’t think of a reason you’d like to cancel…but, in the off-chance you think of one, we can help. You can cancel your order anytime prior to shipment by contacting us at hello@tealdrones.com.
Q.What is your return policy?
A.After we ship, if you are unsatisfied with your Teal you can return it to us within 30 days for a full refund. Contact us at hello@tealdrones.com to start the return process. See our Return Policy and Terms and Conditions page for more details.
Q.What is your warranty policy?
A.Teal has a one-year limited warranty. Please see our Warranty Policy for further details.
