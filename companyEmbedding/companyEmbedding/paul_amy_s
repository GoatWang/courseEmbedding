Publisher's Description▼▲
The seventh volume of this Companion series is devoted to the writings ascribed to Paul but widely thought not to be genuiinely from the Apostle. These are of particular importance in showing how Paul's authority was exploited in the Early Church, and the topics addressed often deal with Christian discipline and hierarchy. Hence there is a particularly strong feminist agenda to be explored here.The Pastoral Epistles, Ephesians and Colossians are prominent among the writings addressed in this sparkling collection, and the authors include David Scholer, Luise Schottroff, Bonnie Thurston, Lilian Portefaix, Sara Winter and Ingrid Rosa Kitzberger.

Amy Paul
Amy Paul, a San Diego native, is drawn to both organic and urban subject matter. Her work explores the line where sacred meets mundane. Watching shadows bend beneath the limbs of a eucalyptus tree or shifting skies above a long stretch of highway-both become meaningful moments against a usually unremarkable backdrop. Paul is a multi-media artist, best known for her work on wood. She has been commissioned for projects in both commercial and residential settings and her design aesthetic is applied in her boutique named Pigment in North Park.

	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.

New Chapter Combines Nature’s Wisdom & Science for Supplements You Can Trust

If you’re familiar with New Chapter, the Vermont-based vitamin and supplement company that was founded in 1982, you probably know their remarkable dedication to sourcing the best ingredients for health in environmentally responsible ways.
New Chapter believes the best way to deliver the healing wisdom of nature is through effective, high-quality products that acknowledge not only the latest science, but are also inspired by time-tested herbal tradition. New Chapter has vowed to only introduce products that will make meaningful contributions-products that are new chapters for holistic health.
Inspired by nature, validated by science
New Chapter’s uncompromising dedication to quality and Mother Earth goes all the way back to their roots. New Chapter® was founded in 1982 by Paul and Barbi Schulick out of a desire to bring the remarkable value of nature’s botanicals into people’s lives. From the beginning, Paul and Barbi made a firm commitment to utilizing each whole plant in its pure, unadulterated form.
Nature, in its wholeness, offers a profound opportunity for supporting well-being!
What sets New Chapter apart
Sourcing the ideal ingredients is key in the production of New Chapter supplements. The company travels the globe for herbs, vegetables, mushrooms and fruits that meet strict standards for purity, potency and especially sustainable sourcing. And these ingredients are bursting with nourishment-organic turmeric from India in Turmeric Force™, wild-caught salmon from Alaska’s clean waters in Wholemega™, 10 potent herbs in clinically studied Zyflamend™ Whole Body and sustainably harvested plant calcium from Iceland in Bone Strength Take Care™. 
New Chapter is also a fermentation pioneer. In 1986 they began creating fermented multivitamins that are easily digestible and gentle on the stomach. Their proven, two-step fermentation method uses the power of clinically studied probiotics to bring vitality to each nutrient and unlock its health benefits. Fermentation creates a nutritious fermentate and unleashes Nature’s immune-boosters called beta glucans. Today, New Chapter makes holistic multivitamins for every stage of life, including prenatal and postnatal support.
 Plus New Chapter became a Certified B Corporation in 2014. B Corps are a vibrant new kind of business that define success not just in terms of profit, but in terms of people and planet.
Discover the New Chapter difference
Just as you might check foods for organic and non-GMO labeling, you can confirm the credentials of New Chapter vitamins and supplements the same way. New Chapter multivitamins are made with third-party certified organic vegetables and herbs, and they’re verified by the Non-GMO Project. You can find the Non-GMO Project Verified seal on Zyflamend™ Whole Body, on all New Chapter herbals and herbal blends, on LifeShield™ mushrooms and on their plant calcium, too.
Paul and Barbi’s mission today remains still the same: to deliver the wisdom of nature to all those seeking natural wellness. Check out New Chapter’s whole family of products and experience your own new chapter in holistic health!
