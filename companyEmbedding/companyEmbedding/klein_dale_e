Office: OHH 314


Dr. Dale E. Klein rejoined The University of Texas System in January of 2011 as Associate Vice Chancellor for Research in the Office of Academic Affairs. In April of 2010, after serving eight and a half years as Presidential Appointee, Dr. Klein returned to Texas from Washington, D.C., working at The University of Texas at Austin as the Associate Director of The Energy Institute, Associate Vice President for Research, and a Professor of Mechanical Engineering (Nuclear Program).
Dr. Klein was sworn into the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2006, and was appointed Chairman by President George W. Bush, serving in that role from July 2006 to May 2009. As Chairman, Dr. Klein was the principal executive officer and official spokesman for the NRC, responsible for conducting the administrative, organizational, long-range planning, budgetary, and certain personnel functions of the agency. Additionally, he had the ultimate authority for all NRC functions pertaining to an emergency involving an NRC licensee. The remainder of this term was as Commissioner of the NRC from May 2009 to March 2010.
Before joining the NRC, Dr. Klein served as the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs. He was appointed to this position by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in 2001. In this position, he served as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology for all policy and planning matters related to nuclear weapons and nuclear, chemical, and biological defense.
Previously, Dr. Klein served as the Vice-Chancellor for Special Engineering Programs at The University of Texas System and as a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering (Nuclear Program) at The University of Texas at Austin. During his tenure at the university, Dr. Klein was Director of the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory, Deputy Director of the Center for Energy Studies, and Associate Dean for Research and Administration in the College of Engineering.
Honors and awards Dr. Klein has received include Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the American Nuclear Society, Engineer of the Year for the State of Texas, the University of Missouri Faculty-Alumni Award, and the University of Missouri Honor Award for Distinguished Service in Engineering.
A native of Missouri, Dr. Klein holds a doctorate in nuclear engineering from the University of Missouri-Columbia. He has published more than 100 technical papers and reports, and co-edited one book. He has made more than 400 presentations on energy and has written numerous technical editorials on energy issues that have been published in major newspapers throughout the United States.

Commissioner Dale E. Klein
						





Printable Version 
The biographies for all of the former Commissioners in this section are the official ones they used during their Commission terms.
Dr. Dale E. Klein was sworn into the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission July 2006.  He was appointed Chairman by President George W. Bush and served in that role from July 1, 2006, to May 13, 2009.  He served as Commissioner from May 13, 2009 until he resigned on March 29, 2010.
Dr. Klein believes that the NRC must continue to ensure the safety and security of current operating reactors as it also prepares to receive more than 30 license applications for new reactors. He has insisted that the NRC remain a strong regulator that articulates its requirements clearly and holds its licensees accountable.  The agency should be demanding yet responsive to legitimate needs. He is an advocate of increased coordination with international partners and has often stated "an accident anywhere is an accident everywhere." Dr. Klein also believes that the NRC should strive to hold itself to the same high standard it expects from its licensees, including modern business practices, up-to-date telecommunications technology, and efficient and transparent sharing of appropriate information.
Before joining the NRC, Dr. Klein served as the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological Defense Programs.  He was appointed to this position by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate on Nov. 8, 2001.  In this position, he served as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology for all policy and planning matters related to nuclear weapons and nuclear, chemical, and biological defense.
Previously, Dr. Klein served as the Vice-Chancellor for Special Engineering Programs at the University of Texas System and as a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering (Nuclear Program) at the University of Texas at Austin. During his tenure at the university, Dr. Klein was Director of the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory, Deputy Director of the Center for Energy Studies, and Associate Dean for Research and Administration in the College of Engineering.
Honors and awards Dr. Klein has received include Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the American Nuclear Society, the Joe J. King Professional Engineering Achievement Award; Engineer of the Year for the State of Texas, the University of Missouri Faculty-Alumni Award, and the University of Missouri Honor Award for Distinguished Service in Engineering.
A native of Missouri, Dr. Klein holds a bachelor's and master's degree in mechanical engineering and a doctorate in nuclear engineering, all from the University of Missouri-Columbia. He has published more than 100 technical papers and reports, and co-edited one book.
He has made more than 300 presentations on energy and has written numerous technical editorials on energy issues that have been published in major newspapers throughout the United States.

Prints in 3-5 business days

Here are a few vignettes of some of life's many adventures, using the interpretive and dramatic skills of the plastic pink flamingo. Writer and photographer Dale J. Klein comments, "You see, like me, they have always tried to just fit in, to be happy, and to have a good time in life. Now, more than ever, we have realized that the world needs to laugh. Whether it's looking for love, facing our fears in the shower, getting a tattoo, or just trying to catch the bus. If you look closely, life has a way of always making things funny. Here are a few flamingo examples we can all relate to. Enjoy!
