This cannot be relied upon as today's offering price.YTD at NAV % - Measured from January 1, 2017 to the most recent established NAV date. Returns include the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions at NAV.Average Annual Total Return at Maximum Offering Price (MOP) - The highest price that may be charged for purchases of fund shares, including the maximum contingent deferred sales charge or the maximum front end sales charge, whichever is applicable. Returns include the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions at NAV as of previous month end or previous quarter end.Morningstar Ratings are as of previous month end.Since Inception return represents Average Annual Total Return at Maximum Offering Price (MOP) from Extended Performance Inception Date as of previous month end or previous quarter end.Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (CDSC) - A deferred sales charge, which is paid at the time of redemption and generally decreases with the amount of time that fund shares are held before sale, ultimately declining to 0%. It is referred to as a contingent sales charge because of such declining schedule. The CDSC is also commonly called a back-end load. Performance displayed reflects the application of these charges.The 7-Day Yield % more closely reflects the current earnings of this money market investment option than the total return displayed.Morningstar Ratings do not reflect the inclusion of sales charges. If sales charges were reflected, rankings could be lower.The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

            Each index based investment option is invested in the stocks or bonds of the index it tracks.  Performance of indexes reflects the unmanaged results for the market segment the selected stocks or bonds represent.  There is no assurance an index based investment option will match the performance of the index tracked.    


3
            International and global investment options are subject to additional risk due to fluctuating exchange rates, foreign accounting and financial policies, and other economic and political environments.    


4
            High yield investment options are subject to greater credit risk and volatility that is associated with high yield bonds.    


5
            Real Estate investment options are subject to investment and liquidity risk and other risks inherent in real estate such as those associated with general and local economic conditions.

            These calculated returns reflect the historical performance of the oldest share class of the fund, adjusted to reflect a portion of the fees and expenses of this share class. For time periods prior to inception date of the fund, predecessor performance is reflected.  Please see the fund's prospectus for more information on specific expenses, and the fund's most recent shareholder report for actual date of first sale. Expenses are deducted from income earned by the fund. As a result, dividends and investment results will differ for each share class.

14
            Fixed-income investment options are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. A portion of the Fund's income may be subject to state and/or local taxes, and it may be subject to federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) for certain investors.

20
            Fixed-income investment options are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. Lower-rated securities are subject to additional credit and default risks. Risks associated with preferred securities differ from risks inherent with other investments. In particular, in the event of bankruptcy, a company's preferred securities are senior to common stock but subordinated to all other types of corporate debt. International investing involves increased risks due to currency fluctuations, political or social instability, and differences in accounting standards, these risks are magnified in emerging markets. REIT securities are subject to risk factors associated with the real estate industry and tax factors of REIT registration.

Investment in derivatives entails specific risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility.  REIT securities are subject to risk factors associated with the real estate industry and tax factors of REIT registration. An MLP that invests in a particular industry (e.g., oil and gas) may be harmed by detrimental economic events within that industry. As partnerships, MLPs may be subject to less regulation (and less protection for investors) under state laws than corporations. In addition, MLPs may be subject to state taxation in certain jurisdictions, which may reduce the amount of income paid by an MLP to its investors.    


32
            For Government High Quality Bond Fund (A) the Distributor has voluntarily agreed to waive .10% which limits the investment option's 12b-1 fees to .15%. These limits apply now but may be terminated at any time.

            This fund utilizes alternative investment strategies such as arbitrage, leverage, derivatives, and shorting securities in addition to traditional investments.

These investments are subject to risks associated with market and interest rate movements. The fund is considered non-diversified which may make it more susceptible to price volatility if the fund does not meet its objective.

                        plan or investment advice from Principal® but may be used as general guidelines
                        to help you make retirement planning or other personal financial decisions. Responsibility for these
                        decisions is assumed by you, not Principal. Individual results will vary.
                        You should regularly review your savings progress and post-retirement needs.            



              All projections, analysis and calculation results are estimates and depend on many factors,

Your Retirement Wellness Score



                Your Retirement Wellness Score indicates the percentage of your pre-retirement income that is estimated to be
                              available at the specified retirement age (based on your personalized inputs and current assumptions). Studies
                              suggest replacing at least 70-85% of your income in retirement.                *
              

                The score compares what you are estimated to have in monthly income at retirement against your estimated monthly
                                pre-retirement income. For example, based on your inputs you may have $1,000 per month when you retire, but your
                                monthly pre-retirement income is $2,000. Your Retirement Wellness Score would be 50.              

                This score, and what you will have, are merely estimates based on information provided by you and several
                              financial assumptions, including a 4.5% withdrawal rate. This information may be valued as of different dates.
                              This is not a guarantee of future income.              

                Your Retirement Wellness Score always assumes you are replacing 100% of your pre-retirement income.
                              So, it will not change if you make changes that impact your desired income in retirement.

Annual Pay



                In most situations, this is either your annual base
                              pay or gross pay. Enter whichever pay amount you feel
                              most accurately reflects the pay your recurring

Retirement Savings



                This amount should include the total assets that you have designated
                                for retirement purposes. This could include employer sponsored retirement
                                plans, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA), mutual funds, stocks, bonds,
                                or non-qualified retirement plan assets.              




















                Principal takes retirement planning—which seems to be a very complicated, scary topic—and makes it more friendly and engaging.
