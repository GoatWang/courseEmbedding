Mutual funds can help lower investing risks
Take some of the anxiety out of investing by letting a mutual fund do a little of the work for you.

Review a short list of Vanguard Select Funds™

Browse Vanguard funds by asset class


Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!
Learn more about The Vanguard Effect™


How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

BARON:  A CULTURE FOCUSED ON GROWTH...BIG             [PHOTO]                   
IDEAS, GREAT PEOPLE, SMALL AND MID-SIZED                                        
BUSINESSES.                                                                     

When I founded  Baron Capital in May 1982, a little more than sixteen years ago,
I had no grand  plan for  Baron  Capital  to  become  what it has.  I had been a
securities  analyst since 1970, and a portfolio  manager/analyst  since 1975. My
initial  investment  successes  in  the  early  1970's  were  the  result  of my
recognizing a few simple,  obvious and potentially large ideas.  McDonald's...we
ate their  $.18  hamburgers  and $.15  fries and drank  their $.10 Cokes in high
school and I felt demand for their food would be  substantial;  their  corporate
growth  was  at an  early  stage;  and,  they  just  had  to be  able  to  raise
prices...Disney...I  was bullish on the prospects  for the new themed  amusement
park they were  building  in  Orlando  and,  for the  100,000  acres  they owned
surrounding that  park...Federal  Express...I  thought the idea of overnight and
reliable  mail  service  for  businesses   sounded  like  a  great   idea...and,
Mattel...the  prospects  for Barbie  seemed to me a lot  bigger  than most other
analysts expected.                                                              

My investment  education  advanced  greatly in the mid  1970's...and,  I finally
began to accumulate  capital...when  I met several  hardworking,  brilliant,  no
nonsense, live by your word, die by your word entrepreneurs with big ideas...Jay
Pritzker,  Hyatt  Hotels...Phil  Berman,  Leader Healthcare and Hess' Department
Stores...David Murdoch,  Flexivan and IBP...and Steve Wynn, Golden Nugget...and,
invested in their  businesses.  In addition to a big, long lasting idea,  people
became the next element of our investment equation.                             

Our formula  continued to evolve.  I determined to invest in small and mid-sized
businesses rather than larger ones. I felt, intuitively, that smaller businesses
had greater potential for growth. Smaller businesses were also less likely to be
priced  efficiently  since few Wall Street analysts cared enough to follow their
progress.  I believed  investment  information  gathered  through my independent
research efforts,  as a result,  would often not yet be reflected in a business'
stock market valuation.  This offered significant  investment advantage,  I felt
then and continue to believe. I invested in a relatively concentrated fashion to
best take advantage of the opportunities my independent  investment research had
unearthed.  I had inadvertently  begun to follow the investment  precept to "put
all your eggs in one basket and don't take your eyes off the basket."           

Finally,  following a strictly  common  sense  approach,  I was only  willing to
invest in a business that could be purchased at an attractive  price. I invested
in  businesses  that                                                            

                                                    NOT PART OF THE PROSPECTUS

could be expected to double in size every three to five years.  I determined  to
purchase  shares in these  businesses only if we could buy shares at prices that
offered my clients the same opportunity.

SIGNIFICANT EMBEDDED OPPORTUNITY.                                               

Baron Capital's investment philosophy...and performance...have been built upon a
relatively  simple,  and  straightforward,  idea. We are long term  investors in
businesses.  We do not trade  stocks.  We think of  ourselves  as part owners of
publicly held businesses...very profitable businesses with important barriers to
prevent others from usurping our corporate opportunities. Businesses in which we
invest are run by terrific executives, entrepreneurial executives we like, trust
and admire...and who are also focused on growth.                                

Our oldest and largest mutual fund,  Baron Asset Fund, was founded in June 1987.
Baron Asset annual portfolio  turnover averaged just 18.7% during the past three
years. This means that we hold an average  investment more than five years! Most
mutual funds that invest in small and mid-sized businesses have annual portfolio
turnover of more than 100%...those funds hold their investments less than twelve
months.1  Investors  in other  funds can  rarely  know  what  their  funds  own.
Investors in Baron Funds know what they own. And, even more  importantly,  Baron
Capital's  analysts,  over  the  years,  have the  opportunity  to  become  more
knowledgeable  about these  businesses than most other  investors,  an important
advantage  for our  shareholders.  Baron Asset has out  performed the S & P 500,
Russell 2000 and, all but a few other funds since its inception.

NTL and Polo Ralph Lauren. We are likely to remain investors in                 
these  businesses,  and  several  others,  as  well,  for  years.  Many  of  our
investments   have   increased   in  value   several   fold  since  our  initial
purchases...Schwab has appreciated more than twenty five times since 1992, Manor
Care seven  times  since 1989,  DeVry  fifteen  times since 1990 and Robert Half
International  more than 44 times since our initial purchases in 1991. All still
offer the  potential to double in price during the next five

years.  Many of our newer  investments  offer our funds'         [PHOTO]        
shareholders even more significant appreciation potential,                      
we believe...although  probably not 44 times                                    
in seven years. Of course, we cannot predict future results.                    

BARON: A GROWTH  BUSINESS...OUR  INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD, OUR
MEDIA COVERAGE GREAT, OUR DISTRIBUTION EXTRAORDINARY!                           

At its founding in 1982, Baron Capital had less than $10 million customer assets
under management.  Our firm was dependent for revenue upon brokerage commissions
paid by its  institutional  customers for our investment  research.  We made the
decision to stop selling our research to others seven years ago. About six years
ago our firm's assets under management  began to grow very rapidly.  Since 1992,
Baron Capital has been one of the fastest  growing  domestic equity mutual funds
in the United States.2 The firm's customer assets under management have grown to
$7.7 billion as of December 31,1998,  the date of this letter. Each year for the
past six years,  Baron  Funds has  garnered  an  increasing  share of the assets
invested in domestic,  equity  mutual  funds.  During the past two years,  Baron
Funds has received more than 1% of net new assets  invested in domestic,  equity
mutual funds. 3                                                                 

Our firm's rapid customer asset growth has been achieved  importantly because we
recognized in 1992 that Charles Schwab's Mutual Fund Marketplace and later, that
Schwab's Mutual Fund OneSource,  would  revolutionize  mutual fund distribution.
Baron Funds has benefited  greatly not just from its  participation  in Schwab's
OneSource,  but also as a member  in  Fidelity's  FundsNetwork  and  other  fund
"supermarket"  distribution  systems. The strong performance of Baron Asset Fund
since 1987,  and of our managed  accounts for the  seventeen  years  prior,  had
already  attracted  the  attention of the  financial  press.  The new  financial
supermarkets permitted independent,  fee based financial planners, for the first
time, to easily invest for their clients in our by then already well known,  but
still small mutual fund.  The very  favorable  publicity we have received in the
financial  press  since has helped us add retail  investors,  also  through  the
convenience of the financial supermarkets.                                      

Baron Asset Fund has increasingly  been chosen as one of several mutual funds to
be  offered as a  possible  401(k)  investment  option  for  employees  of large
corporations.  Our strategic  alliances with other large mutual fund  management
companies  and  brokerage  firms  have also  helped us begin to grow our  401(k)
investors.  We believe 401 (k) plan  investors  will continue to increase  their
percentage ownership of our mutual funds. This is of benefit to our funds' other
shareholders  since these assets have  greater  persistency,  namely,  they last
longer, and, accordingly,  allow us to continue to make longer term, potentially
very profitable investments in businesses.                                      

BARON HAS TERRIFIC EMPLOYEES...TALENTED, ETHICAL, HARD WORKING, LOYAL.

Baron Capital has  attracted...trained...and  retained...        [PHOTO]        
exceptionally  talented and dedicated employees. As a                           
result, our firm's financial expertise,  knowledge

during the past five years has been virtually nil.                              

I am grateful to my fellow employees for the contributions they have made to our

THANK YOU FOR INVESTING IN BARON FUNDS                                          

We  recognize  it  cannot be an easy  decision  for most  individuals  and their
families  when choosing  mutual funds in which to invest.  It must be especially
difficult  when you must consider how to invest your hard earned savings to fund
your retirement, your children's education or a new home. We understand the task
must be even more daunting  since there are now more mutual funds than there are
stocks.  We hope our  shareholder  letters,  interviews  in the press and annual
investment  conferences  have made it easier for you to determine if Baron Funds
represents an appropriate investment for you and your family.                   

I want to thank  you for  choosing  to join us as fellow  shareholders  at Baron
Funds.  I also want to thank our fellow  employees for the  confidence  you have
shown in me and in our  business.  We will continue to work hard to justify this
confidence. We are looking forward to a successful 1999.                        

Sincerely,

INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUNDS                                                     
INVESTMENT GOALS AND STRATEGIES                                                 
The investment goals of the Funds are:                                          

BARON ASSET FUND      capital appreciation through investments in securities of 
                    small and medium sized companies with undervalued assets
or favorable growth prospects       

BARON GROWTH FUND     capital appreciation                                      

BARON SMALL CAP FUND  capital appreciation through investments primarily in     
securities of small companies       

Effective May 19, 1999, the  shareholders of Baron Growth Fund voted to         
change the  investment  goal and  objective  to capital  appreciation,  dropping
income as a secondary objective.  The Board of Trustees then changed the name of
the Fund to BARON GROWTH FUND.                                                  

Investment decisions are made by the Funds' investment adviser, BAMCO, Inc. (the
"Adviser").                                                                     

BARON ASSET FUND and BARON GROWTH FUND invest primarily in small sized companies
with market  capitalizations  of approximately  $100 million to $1.5 billion and
medium sized  companies with market values of $1.5 billion to $5 billion.  BARON
SMALL CAP FUND invests at least 65% of its total  assets,  measured at cost,  in
the securities of smaller companies with market values of up to $1.5 billion and
it can invest up to 35% in the securities of larger sized companies.            

Although Baron Funds invest primarily in small and medium sized  companies,  the
Funds will not sell positions  just because their market values have  increased.
The  Funds  will add to its  positions  in a  company  even  though  its  market
capitalization has increased through  appreciation beyond the limits stated, if,
in the Adviser's judgment,  the company is still an attractive  investment.  The
Funds may invest in larger  companies  if the Adviser  perceives  an  attractive
opportunity in a larger company.                                                

WHAT DOES THE ADVISER LOOK FOR?                                                 
In making  investment  decisions for the Funds the Adviser seeks securities that
the Adviser believes have:                                                      
o    favorable price to value  characteristics based on the Adviser's assessment
of their prospects for future growth and profitability.               
o    the potential to increase in value at least 50% over two subsequent years.

P-->49710th�Page�of�48TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
The Adviser  thoroughly  researches  the  companies  in which the Funds  invest.
Included in the research  process are visits and  interviews by the Adviser with
company  managements and their major competitors.  The Adviser looks for special
business niches, unusually favorable business opportunities,  the opportunity to
benefit from long lasting economic trends,  barriers to entry, strong management
capabilities,  and strong balance sheets.  The Funds may take large positions in
the companies in which the Adviser has the greatest conviction. The Funds have a
long term outlook;  they are not short-term  traders of securities.  There is no
assurance that the Funds will meet their investment goals.                      

WHAT KINDS OF SECURITIES DO THE FUNDS BUY?                                      
The  Funds  invest  primarily  in  common  stocks  but may also  invest in other
equity-type  securities  such as  convertible  bonds and  debentures,  preferred
stocks,  warrants and convertible preferred stocks.  Securities are selected for
their  capital   appreciation   potential,   and  investment  income  is  not  a
consideration.                                                                  

The equity security portion of the portfolios consist primarily of common stocks
and  may  include  convertible   securities,   preferred  stocks,  warrants  and
convertible  preferred  stocks.  The debt security portion of the portfolios may
include notes, bonds,  debentures and money market instruments.  Debt securities
represent an obligation of the issuer to repay a loan of money to it, often with
interest.  The debt  securities in which the Funds may invest  include rated and
unrated securities and convertible  instruments.  There is no minimum rating for
the debt securities that may be purchased for those Funds. The Funds rely on the
Adviser's  assessment  of the  issuer's  securities  and do not use  independent
ratings organizations.                                                          

WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL RISKS OF INVESTING IN THE FUNDS?                         

GENERAL STOCK MARKET RISK o The Funds' principal risks are those of investing in
the stock  market.  The value of your  investment in a Fund will increase as the
stock  market  prices  of the  securities  owned by the Fund  increase  and will
decrease as the Fund's investments  decrease in market value.  Equity securities
fluctuate in value, often based on factors unrelated to the value of the issuer,
such as  political,  economic or general  market  conditions.  Because the stock
values  fluctuate,  when you sell your  investment  you may receive more or less
money than you originally invested.                                             

4 PROSPECTUS                                                                    

P-->49711th�Page�of�48TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED COMPANIES o The Adviser  believes there is more potential
for capital  appreciation in smaller  companies and in establishing  significant
positions in companies  in which the Adviser has the  greatest  conviction,  but
there also may be more risk.  Securities  of smaller  companies  may not be well
known to most investors and the  securities may be thinly traded.  There is more
reliance on the skills of a compa ny's management and on their continued tenure.
Investments may be attractively priced relative to the Adviser's assessment of a
company's growth prospects,  management expertise,  and business niche, yet have
modest or no current cash flows or earnings.  Although the Adviser  concentrates
on a company's growth  prospects,  it also focuses on cash flow, asset value and
reported earnings. This investment approach requires a long-term outlook and may
require  shareholders  to  assume  more  risk  and to have  more  patience  than
investing in the securities of larger, more established companies.              

DEBT  SECURITIES  o Lower  rated  securities  may  have a higher  yield  and the
potential for a greater  return than  investment  grade  securities but may also
have more risk.  Lower rated  securities  are  generally  meant for  longer-term
investing and may be subject to certain risks with respect to the issuing entity
and to market fluctuations.  See the SAI for more information.  The Adviser will
also evaluate the  securities and the ability of the issuers to pay interest and
principal.  With lower rated debt  securities,  a Fund's  ability to achieve its
investment objective may be more dependent on the Adviser's credit analysis than
might be the case with higher  rated  securities.  The market price and yield of
lower rated  securities  are generally  more volatile than those of higher rated
securities.  Factors  adversely  affecting  the market  price and yield of these
securities will adversely  affect the Fund's net asset value. The trading market
for these  securities  may be less liquid than that of higher rated  securities.
Companies that issue lower rated  securities may be highly leveraged or may have
unstable earnings, and consequently the risk of the investment in the securities
of such issuers may be greater than with higher rated securities.               

The interest bearing features of debt securities carry a promise of income flow,
but the price of the  securities  are inversely  affected by changes in interest
rates and are therefore  subject to the risk of market price  fluctuations.  The
market values of debt  securities  may also be affected by changes in the credit
ratings or financial condition of the issuers.                                  

CONVERTIBLE  SECURITIES o Since  convertible  securities  combine the investment
characteristics  of  both  bonds  and  common  stocks,  the  Funds'  convertible
securities  investments  absorb the market  risks of both stocks and bonds.  The
combination does,  however,  make the investment less sensitive to interest rate
changes than straight bonds of comparable  maturity and quality and usually less
volatile than common stocks.  Because of these factors,  convertible  securities
are likely to perform  differently than broadly-based  measures of the stock and
bond markets.

This  example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Funds
with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.  The example  assumes that you
invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of
your shares at the end of those  periods.  The example  also  assumes  that your
investment  has a 5% return  each year and that the  Funds'  operating  expenses
remain the same.  Although  your actual  costs may be higher or lower,  based on
these assumptions your costs would be:

There are additional charges if you have retirement accounts and wire transfers.
You also may purchase and redeem your shares  through  broker-dealers  or others
who may charge a commission or other  transaction fee for their  services.  (See
"How to Purchase Shares" and "How to Redeem Shares")                            

The 12b-1 fee is paid to Baron Capital,  Inc. for shareholder  and  distribution
services.  Because the fee is paid out of the Funds' assets on an ongoing basis,
over time it will  increase  the cost of your  investment  and may cost you more
than paying other types of sales charges.                                       

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 

The financial  highlights  table is intended to help you  understand  the Funds'
financial  performance  for the  fiscal  years  indicated.  Certain  information
reflects financial results for a single fund share. The "total return" shows how
much your investment in the Fund would have increased (or decreased) during each
period,  assuming you had  reinvested  all  dividends and  distributions.  These
financial  highlights  have been  audited by  PricewaterhouseCoopers,  LLP,  the
Funds' independent  accountants,  whose report,  along with the Funds' financial
statements, is included in the annual report.

OTHER INVESTMENT STRATEGIES 
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER INVESTMENTS THE FUNDS MAKE?                          

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS o When  the  Adviser  determines  that  opportunities  for
profitable  investments are limited or that adverse market  conditions exist and
believes that investing for temporary defensive purposes is appropriate,  all or
a portion of the Funds'  assets may be  invested  in money  market  instruments,
which include U.S.  Government  securities,  certificates  of deposit,  bankers'
acceptances,  short-term  investment  grade corporate bonds and other short-term
debt  instruments,  and  repurchase  agreements.  If the  Funds  take  temporary
defensive positions their investment objectives may not be achieved. BARON ASSET
FUND may  borrow  up to 5% of its net  assets  for  extraordinary  or  emergency
temporary  investment  purposes  or to  meet  redemption  requests  which  might
otherwise  require an untimely  sale of  portfolio  securities.  BARON  GROWTH  
FUND and BARON                                                                  

10 PROSPECTUS                                                                   

P-->49717th�Page�of�48TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�17th
SMALL  CAP FUND may  borrow  up to 30% of the  value of their  respective  total
assets,  including the amount borrowed, as of the time the borrowing is made for
temporary, emergency or other purposes.                                         

ILLIQUID  SECURITIES  o BARON ASSET FUND may invest up to 10%,  and BARON GROWTH
FUND and BARON  SMALL CAP FUND may  invest up to 15%,  of their  respective  net
assets in securities that are illiquid.  An illiquid security is one that cannot
be disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven days.            

SPECIAL  SITUATIONS  o The Funds may invest in "special  situations."  A special
situation  arises  when,  in the opinion of the  Adviser,  the  securities  of a
company will be recognized and appreciate in value due to a specific anticipated
development at that company.  Such developments  might include a new product,  a
management change, an acquisition or a technological advancement.               

OPTIONS AND DERIVATIVES o BARON ASSET FUND may write (sell) covered call options
or purchase put options on equity and/or debt securities.  BARON GROWTH FUND and
BARON SMALL CAP FUND may write  (sell) put options and covered  call options and
purchase put and call options on equity  and/or debt  securities.  A call option
gives  the  purchaser  of the  options  the  right to buy,  and  when  exercised
obligates the writer to sell, the underlying  security at the exercise  price. A
put  option  gives the  purchaser  of the  option  the  right to sell,  and when
exercised  obligates the writer to buy, the underlying  security at the exercise
price. The options may be listed or  over-the-counter.  The Funds may also enter
into equity swap agreements with approved parties.                              

REITs o The Funds may invest in the equity  securities of real estate investment
trusts ("REITs"). A REIT is a corporation or business trust that invests in real
estate and derives its income from rents from real property or interest on loans
secured by mortgages on real property.                                          

OTHER  STRATEGIES  o  The  Funds  have  additional   investment  strategies  and
restrictions that govern their activities.  For a list of these restrictions and
more  information  about  the  investment  strategies,  please  see the  section
"Investment  Goals,  Strategies  and  Risks"  in  the  Statement  of  Additional
Information.  Those that are identified as "fundamental"may only be changed with
shareholder approval, while the others may be changed by the Board of Trustees. 

WHAT ARE SOME ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS?                                          

OPTIONS AND DERIVATIVES o Options may fail as hedging  techniques in cases where
the price  movements of the securities  underlying the options do not follow the
price  movements  of the  portfolio  securities  subject to the hedge.  Gains on
investments  in  options  and  derivatives  depend on the  Adviser's  ability to
anticipate  correctly the direction of stock prices,  interest rates,  and other
economic factors. The dealer who

takes the other side of a  derivative  transaction  could  fail.  Where a liquid
secondary  market  does not exist,  the Fund  would  likely be unable to control
losses by closing its position.                                                 

BORROWINGS o To the extent a Fund  borrows,  it must maintain  continuous  asset
coverage of 300% of the amount  borrowed.  Such borrowing has special risks. Any
amount borrowed will be subject to interest costs that may or may not exceed the
appreciation of the securities purchased.                                       

ILLIQUID SECURITIES o The absence of a trading market could make it difficult to
ascertain a market value for illiquid positions.  A Fund's net asset value could
be adversely affected if there were no ready buyer at an acceptable price at the
time the Fund decided to sell.  Time-consuming  negotiations  and expenses could
occur in disposing of the shares.                                               

REAL  ESTATE  INVESTMENT  TRUSTS o The market  value of REITs may be affected by
changes  in the tax laws or by  their  inability  to  qualify  for the  tax-free
pass-through  of their  income.  The REIT portion of the  portfolio  may also be
affected  by general  fluctuations  in real  estate  values and by  defaults  by
borrowers or tenants.                                                           

SPECIAL  SITUATIONS o Investments in special  situations  have the risk that the
anticipated  development  does  not  occur  or does  not  attract  the  expected
attention.                                                                      

MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND                                                          

The Board of Trustees  oversees the management of the Funds. A list of the Board
members and of the Funds'  officers may be found in the  Statement of Additional
Information. BAMCO, Inc., the Adviser, is located at 767 Fifth Avenue, New York,
New York 10153, and is responsible for portfolio management.  It is a subsidiary
of Baron Capital Group, Inc. ("BCG").  Baron Capital, Inc. ("Baron Capital"),  a
registered broker-dealer and the distributor of the shares of the Funds, is also
a subsidiary of BCG.                                                            

Ronald Baron is the founder,  president, chief executive officer and chairman of
the Adviser and BCG and is the principal owner of BCG. Morty Schaja is the chief
operating officer of the Adviser and BCG.                                       

Mr.  Baron has been the  portfolio  manager of BARON ASSET FUND and BARON GROWTH
FUND  since  their  inception.  He has  managed  money for  others  since  1975.
Beginning in January 1999, BARON GROWTH FUND is managed by a team that is headed
by Ron Baron and that includes  Matt Ervin and Mitch Rubin.  Matt Ervin has been
an  analyst  with  Baron  Funds for 4 years and  before  that was an  analyst at
another large money  management firm. Mitch Rubin has worked at Baron Funds as a
analyst  for 3 years and before that was an analyst at a large  brokerage  firm.
Clifford Greenberg has been the portfolio manag                                 

12 PROSPECTUS                                                                   

P-->49719th�Page�of�48TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�19th
er of BARON SMALL CAP FUND since its inception. Mr. Greenberg joined Baron Funds
in  January  of 1997.  He was a general  partner  and  portfolio  manager at HPB
Associates,  L.P., an investment  partnership  from January 1990 until he joined
Baron Funds. The portfolio managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management  of the  portfolios.  They also may serve as  portfolio  managers  or
analysts for other products offered by affiliates that could conflict with their
responsibilities  to the Funds.  The Adviser  also keeps the books of account of
each Fund, and calculates daily the income and net asset value per share of each
Fund.  For its  services,  the Adviser  receives a fee payable  monthly from the
assets of each  Fund  equal to 1% per annum of each  Fund's  respective  average
daily net asset value.                                                          

Brokerage transactions for the Funds in exchange-listed  securities are executed
primarily by or through the Adviser's affiliate,  Baron Capital, when consistent
with  trying to obtain the best net results  for the Funds.  Baron  Capital is a
registered  broker-dealer  and a member of the NASD. Please see the Statement of
Additional Information for more information about trade executions.             

YEAR 2000 o Fund operations and shareholders  could be adversely affected if the
computer  systems used by BAMCO, the Funds' other service  providers,  and other
entities with computer  systems  linked to the Fund do not properly  process and
calculate  date- related  information  from and after January 1, 2000.  BAMCO is
working to avoid these  problems  and to obtain  assurances  from other  service
providers that they are taking similar  steps.  In addition,  to the extent that
operations  of  issuers  of  securities  held  by  the  Funds  are  impaired  by
date-related  problems  or  prices  decline  as a  result  of real or  perceived
date-related  problems of issuers held by the Fund or  generally,  the net asset
value of the Funds will decline.                                                

12b-1 PLAN                                                                      
The Funds have  adopted a plan  under  rule  12b-1  that  allows the Fund to pay
distribution fees for the sale and distribution of their shares and for services
provided to shareholders.  Because the fees are paid out of the Funds' assets on
an  on-going  basis,  over  time  these  fees  will  increase  the  cost of your
investment and may cost you more than paying other types of sales  charges.  The
12b-1 plan authorizes the Fund to pay Baron Capital a distribution  fee equal on
an  annual  basis to 0.25% of each  Fund's  average  daily net  assets.  See the
Statement of Additional  Information for a more detailed listing of the expenses
covered by the Distribution Plan.

INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR INVESTMENT                                               
HOW YOUR SHARES ARE PRICED                                                      
The  purchase or sale price for your shares is the  particular  Fund's net asset
value  per  share  ("NAV"),  which is  generally  calculated  as of the close of
trading of the New York Stock Exchange  (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each
day the Exchange is open.  Your  purchase or sale will be priced at the next NAV
calculated  after your order is accepted by the Baron Funds'  transfer agent. If
you purchase or sell shares through a brokerage  firm,  bank or other  financial
institution,  your  transaction  will receive the NAV next calculated  after the
financial  institution  receives  your  order  and  transmits  it to the  Funds'
transfer agent.  The Funds'  investments are valued based on the last sale price
or where market  quotations  are not readily  available,  based on fair value as
determined  by  the  Adviser,  using  procedures  established  by the  Board  of
Trustees. The Funds may have arrangements with certain institutions with respect
to the actual  receipt of orders.  The Funds may change the time at which orders
are priced if the Exchange closes at a different time or an emergency exists.   

HOW TO PURCHASE SHARES

You may redeem your shares of the Funds by any of the methods  described  below.
There are no  redemption  charges.  If you are selling  shares in an IRA account
please read the information in the IRA kit.  Redemptions  will not be made until

A SIGNATURE GUARANTEE IS REQUIRED FOR REDEMPTIONS GREATER THAN $50,000.  See the
"Special  Information About  Redemptions"  section on page XX. Within three days
after receipt of a redemption  request by the transfer agent in proper form, the
Fund will normally mail you the proceeds.                                       

BY TELEPHONE                                                                    
If you have  selected  the  telephone  redemption  option  when you opened  your
account,  you may redeem  your shares by  telephone.  To add this option to your
account call  1-800-442-3814  for a telephone  redemption  form. Once made, your
telephone  request cannot be changed.  The minimum amount that you may redeem by
telephone is $1,000.  The maximum amount that you may redeem by telephone in any
quarter is $50,000.  You may receive  the  proceeds by any one of the  following
methods:  (a) we will  mail a check to the  address  to which  your  account  is
registered,  (b) we will transmit the proceeds by electronic funds transfer to a
pre-authorized bank account (usually a two banking day process),  or (c) we will
wire the proceeds to a  pre-authorized  bank account for a $10.00 fee (usually a
next banking day process).                                                      

The Funds have the right to refuse a  telephone  redemption  if they  believe it
advisable  to do so.  If you  have  selected  the  telephone  option  you may be
responsible  for any fraudulent  telephone  order as long as the Funds and their
transfer agent use reasonable procedures to confirm that telephone  instructions
are genuine.

You may redeem  shares  through  broker-dealers  or other  institutions  who may
charge you a fee. The Funds may have special redemption  procedures with certain
broker-dealers.                                                                 

SPECIAL INFORMATION ABOUT REDEMPTIONS 

If the amount to be redeemed is greater than $50,000, all of the signatures on a
redemption  request and/or  certificate must be guaranteed.  If you have changed
your address within 30 days of a redemption  request,  a signature  guarantee is
required.  A signature guarantee helps protect you and the Funds from fraud. You
can obtain a signature  guarantee from most securities  firms or banks,  but not
from a notary public. If you are redeeming  $50,000 or less per quarter,  and if
proceeds are sent to the address of record, no signature  guarantee is required.
For joint  accounts,  each signature must be guaranteed.  Please call if you are
unsure of any of the  requirements.  Please  remember  that the  Funds  will not
redeem your shares until the original  letter of instruction  with the signature
guarantee in proper form has been received by the transfer agent.               

Any Fund share  certificates  that have been issued  must be returned  with your
redemption  request.  The transfer  agent may require other  documentation  from
corporations,  trustees,  executors,  and  others  who hold  shares on behalf of
someone else. If you have any questions concerning the requirements, please call
the transfer agent at 1-800-442-3814.  Redemptions will not be made until all of
the conditions,  including receipt of all required documentation by the transfer
agent, have been satisfied.                                                     

A redemption or exchange of Fund shares may generate a tax liability.           

If you redeem  more than  $250,000 or 1% of the net asset value of a Fund during
any 90-day period,  the Fund has the right to pay the redemption  price,  either
totally or partially, by a distribution of portfolio securities instead of cash.

If your account falls below $2,000 because of withdrawals,  the Fund may ask you
to increase  your balance.  If it is still below $2,000 after 60 days,  the Fund
may close your account and send you the proceeds.                               

The Funds may suspend the normal  redemption  process if trading on the New York
Stock Exchange is suspended or if an emergency exists that reasonably  precludes
the valuation of the Funds' net assets.

DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES 
Each Fund pays its  shareholders  dividends from its net  investment  income and
distributes any net realized  capital gains once each year.  Your  distributions
will be reinvested in the Fund unless you instruct the Fund otherwise. There are
no charges on reinvestments.  After every distribution,  the value of a share is
automatically  reduced  by the amount of the  distribution.  If you elect not to
reinvest and the postal or other delivery service is unable to deliver checks to
your address of record,  your  distribution  will be  reinvested  in  additional
shares. No interest will accrue on amounts represented by uncashed  distribution
or redemption checks.                                                           

You are  subject  to  federal  income  tax on Fund  distributions,  unless  your
investment is in an IRA or other  tax-advantaged  account. The tax status of any
distribution  is the same  regardless  of how long you have invested in the Fund
and whether you reinvest  your  distributions  or take them in cash.  Income and
short-term  capital gain  distributions  are taxed at the ordinary  income rate.
Long-term capital gains  distributions are taxed at either 10% or 20%, depending
on your tax bracket.  The tax status of the annual distribution will be detailed
in an annual tax statement from the Fund. Distributions declared by the Fund may
also be subject to state and local taxes.  You should  consult with your own tax
adviser regarding your personal tax situation.                                  

If you do not  provide  the Fund with your valid  social  security  or  taxpayer
identification number, you will be subject to backup withholding for taxes.

FUND HISTORY AND CLASSIFICATION 
--------------------------------                                                

BARON  ASSET  FUND is a no-load,  open-end,  diversified  management  investment
company  organized  as a  series  fund  and  established  under  the laws of the
Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  on February  19,  1987.  There are three series
currently available (individually a "Fund" and collectively the "Funds"):  BARON
ASSET FUND,  started in June of 1987,  BARON GROWTH FUND,  started in January of
1995, and BARON SMALL CAP FUND, started October 1, 1997. Effective May 19, 1999,
the  shareholders  of BARON GROWTH & INCOME FUND voted to change the  investment
goal and  objective  to capital  appreciation,  dropping  income as a  secondary
objective.  The Board of  Trustees  then  changed  the name of the Fund to BARON
GROWTH FUND.                                                                    

INVESTMENT GOALS,  STRATEGIES AND RISKS 
---------------------------------------                                         

BARON ASSET FUND's investment  objective is to seek capital appreciation through
investments in securities of small and medium sized  companies with  undervalued
assets or favorable growth prospects.  Baron Growth Fund's investment  objective
is to seek capital appreciation.  BARON SMALL CAP FUND's investment objective is
to seek capital  appreciation  through  investments  primarily in  securities of
small  companies.  BARON ASSET FUND and BARON  GROWTH FUND invest  primarily  in
small sized companies with market  capitalizations of approximately $100 million
to $1.5 billion and medium sized companies with market values of $1.5 billion to
$5  billion.  BARON  SMALL CAP FUND  invests  at least 65% of its total  assets,
measured at cost, in the  securities of smaller  companies with market values of
up to $1 billion. It may invest up to 35% in the securities of larger companies.

In addition to the principal investment strategies of the Funds described in the
Prospectus  on  pages 3 and 10,  the  Funds  may use the  additional  strategies
described below.  These investment  strategies are not fundamental  policies and
may be changed by the Fund's Board of Trustees.  Shareholders  would be notified
of any material changes. Some of the strategies discussed below are mentioned in
the Prospectus, but are explained in more detail here.                          

FOREIGN  SECURITIES  The Funds may  invest up to 10% of their  respective  total
assets  directly in the  securities  of foreign  issuers  which are not publicly
traded in the U.S. and may also invest in foreign securities in domestic markets
through  depositary  receipts  without  regard to this  limitation.  The Adviser
currently  intends to invest  not more than 10% of the Funds'  assets in foreign
securities,  including  both direct  investments  and  investments  made through
depositary   receipts.   These  securities  may  involve  additional  risks  not
associated  with  securities  of domestic  companies,  including  exchange  rate
fluctuations,  political or economic  instability,  the  imposition  of exchange
controls,  or  expropriation  or  confiscatory  taxation.   Issuers  of  foreign
securities are subject to different, often less detailed, accounting,  reporting
and disclosure  requirements than are domestic issuers.  The Funds may invest in
securities  commonly  known as American  Depository  Receipts  ("ADRs"),  and in
European  Depository  Receipts  ("EDRs") or other  securities  convertible  into
securities of foreign issuers.  ADRs are certificates  issued by a United States
bank or trust company and represent the right to receive securities of a foreign
issuer  deposited in a domestic  bank or foreign  branch of a United States bank
and traded on a United States exchange or in an over-the-  counter market.  EDRs
are receipts issued in Europe generally by a non-U.S. bank or trust company that
evidence ownership of non-U.S. or domestic  securities.  Generally,  ADRs are in
registered  form and EDRs are in bearer  form.  There are no fees imposed on the
purchase or sale of ADR's or EDRs although the issuing bank or trust company may
impose fees on the purchase of  dividends  and the  conversion  of ADRs and EDRs
into the underlying  securities.  Investment in ADRs has certain advantages over
direct investment in the underlying non-U.S. securities, since (i) ADRs are U.S.
dollar  denominated  investments  which are  easily  transferable  and for which
market  quotations are readily  available and (ii) issuers whose  securities are
represented by ADRs are subject to the same  auditing,  accounting and financial
reporting standards as domestic issuers. EDRs are not necessarily denominated in
the currency of the underlying security.

P-->49729th�Page�of�48TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
LENDING The Funds may lend their portfolio securities to institutions as a means
of earning additional income. In lending their portfolio  securities,  the Funds
may incur  delays in  recovery of loaned  securities  or a loss of rights in the
collateral.  To minimize  such risks,  such loans will only be made if the Funds
deem the other  party to be of good  standing  and  determines  that the  income
justifies  the risk.  BARON  ASSET FUND will not lend more than 10% of its total
assets and BARON  GROWTH  FUND and BARON  SMALL CAP FUND will not lend more than
25% of their respective total assets.                                           

MORTGAGE-BACKED  SECURITIES  BARON GROWTH FUND may invest up to 5% of its assets
in mortgage-backed  securities that are issued or guaranteed by U.S.  government
agencies  or  instrumentalities,   such  as  the  Government  National  Mortgage
Association  and the  Federal  National  Mortgage  Association.  Mortgage-backed
securities represent direct or indirect  participation in, or are secured by and
payable from,  mortgage  loans secured by real  property.  These  securities are
subject to the risk that prepayments on the underlying  mortgages will cause the
principal  and interest on the  mortgage-backed  securities  to be paid prior to
their stated  maturities.  Mortgage  prepayments  are more likely to  accelerate
during periods of declining  long-term  interest rates. If a prepayment  occurs,
BARON  GROWTH  FUND may have  unanticipated  proceeds  which it may then have to
invest at a lower interest rate, and may be penalized by not having participated
in a comparable security not subject to prepayment.                             

WHEN-ISSUED  SECURITIES The Funds may invest up to 5% of their respective assets
in debt and equity  securities  purchased on a when-issued  basis.  Although the
payment and interest terms of when-issued securities are established at the time
the purchaser enters into the commitment, the actual payment for and delivery of
when-issued  securities generally takes place within 45 days. The Fund bears the
risk that  interest  rates on debt  securities  at the time of  delivery  may be
higher or lower than those contracted for on the when-issued  security.  Failure
of the issuer to deliver  the  security  purchased  on a  when-issued  basis may
result in a loss or missed opportunity to make an alternative investment.       

MEDIUM AND LOWER RATED  CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES All of the Funds may invest in
debt securities. BARON GROWTH FUND and BARON SMALL CAP FUND may invest up to 35%
of their  respective  total assets in securities that are rated in the medium to
lowest rating categories by S&P and Moody's, some of which may be known as "junk
bonds."                                                                         

The Funds  will rely on the  Adviser's  judgment,  analysis  and  experience  in
evaluating debt  securities.  The Adviser  believes that the difference  between
perceived risk and actual risk creates the  opportunity  for profit which can be
realized through thorough analysis. Ratings by S&P and Moody's evaluate only the
safety of principal and interest  payments,  not market value risk.  Because the
creditworthiness  of an issuer may change more rapidly than is able to be timely
reflected  in changes in credit  ratings,  the Adviser  monitors  the issuers of
corporate  debt  securities  held in the Funds'  portfolio.  The credit  ratings
assigned by a rating  agency to a security are not  considered by the Adviser in
selecting a security.  The Adviser examines the intrinsic value of a security in
light of market conditions and the underlying fundamental values. Because of the
nature of medium and lower rated corporate debt  securities,  achievement by the
Funds  of  their  respective   investment  objectives  when  investing  in  such
securities is dependent on the credit analysis of the Adviser. The Adviser could
be wrong in its analysis.  If the Funds  purchased  primarily  higher rated debt
securities, risks would be substantially reduced.                               

A general  economic  downturn or a significant  increase in interest rates could
severely disrupt the market for medium and lower grade corporate debt securities
and adversely affect the market value of such securities. The ability of issuers
of medium and lower grade  corporate debt  securities to repay  principal and to
pay  interest,  to  meet  projected  business  goals  and to  obtain  additional
financing may be adversely  affected by economic  conditions.  Such consequences
could  lead to an  increased  incidence  of  default  for  such  securities  and
adversely  affect  the  value  of the  corporate  debt  securities  in a        

-4-     

P-->49730th�Page�of�48TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
Fund's  portfolio.  The  secondary  market  prices  of medium  and  lower  grade
corporate  debt  securities are more  sensitive to adverse  economic  changes or
individual corporate developments than are higher rated debt securities. Adverse
publicity and investor  perceptions,  whether or not based on rational analysis,
and periods of economic  uncertainty  may also affect the value and liquidity of
medium and lower grade  corporate  debt  securities,  although such factors also
present investment opportunities when prices fall below intrinsic values. Yields
on debt  securities  in the portfolio  that are interest  rate  sensitive can be
expected to fluctuate over time.                                                

To the extent that there is no established  market for some of the medium or low
grade corporate debt securities in which the Funds may invest, there may be thin
or no  trading  in such  securities  and the  ability  of the  Adviser  to value
accurately such securities may be adversely  affected.  Further,  it may be more
difficult for a Fund to sell  securities for which no established  retail market
exists as compared with  securities  for which such a market does exist.  During
periods of reduced  market  liquidity  and in the  absence of readily  available
market quotations for medium and lower grade corporate debt securities held in a
Fund's  portfolio,  the  responsibility  of the  Adviser  to value  that  Fund's
securities  becomes more difficult and the Adviser's judgment may play a greater
role in the valuation of the Fund's securities due to a reduced  availability of
reliable objective data.                                                        

To the extent that a Fund purchases illiquid  securities or securities which are
restricted  as to  resale,  that Fund may  incur  additional  risks  and  costs.
Illiquid and restricted  securities may be  particularly  difficult to value and
their  disposition  may  require  greater  effort and  expense  than more liquid
securities.  A Fund may be  required  to  incur  costs  in  connection  with the
registration  of restricted  securities in order to dispose of such  securities,
although under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 certain securities may
be  determined  to be liquid  pursuant  to  procedures  adopted  by the Board of
Trustees  under  applicable  guidelines.  The Funds may invest in  securities of
distressed issuers when the intrinsic values of such securities,  in the opinion
of the Adviser, warrant such investment.                                        

OTHER DEBT  SECURITIES  The Funds may invest in  zero-coupon,  step-coupon,  and
pay-in-kind  securities.  These  securities are debt securities that do not make
regular interest payments.  Zero-coupon and step-coupon securities are sold at a
deep discount to their face value;  pay-in-kind  securities pay interest through
the issuance of additional securities. The market value of these debt securities
generally  fluctuates  in  response  to changes in  interest  rates to a greater
degree than  interest-paying  securities  of  comparable  term and quality.  The
secondary  market value of corporate debt  securities  structured as zero coupon
securities  or  payment-in-kind  securities  may be more volatile in response to
changes in interest rates than debt securities  which pay interest  periodically
in cash. Because such securities do not pay current interest, but rather, income
is  accrued,  to the  extent  that a Fund does not have  available  cash to meet
distribution  requirements  with respect to such income, it could be required to
dispose of portfolio  securities that it otherwise  would not. Such  disposition
could be at a disadvantageous price. Investment in such securities also involves
certain tax considerations.                                                     

BARON  GROWTH FUND and BARON SMALL CAP FUND from time to time may also  purchase
indebtedness and participations  therein, both secured and unsecured,  of debtor
companies in reorganization or financial restructuring. Such indebtedness may be
in the form of loans,  notes,  bonds or  debentures.  When the Funds  purchase a
participation  interest they assume the credit risk  associated with the bank or
other  financial  intermediary  as well as the credit risk  associated  with the
issuer of any underlying debt instrument.  The Funds may also purchase trade and
other claims against, and other unsecured obligations of, such debtor companies,
which  generally  represent  money due a supplier  of goods or  services to such
company.  Some  debt  securities  purchased  by the  Funds  may have  very  long
maturities.  The  length of time  remaining  until  maturity  is one  factor the
Adviser  considers  in  purchasing a  particular  indebtedness.  The purchase of
indebtedness   of  a  troubled   company  always  involves  a  risk  as  to  the
creditworthiness  of the issuer and the  possibility  that the investment may be
lost. The Adviser believes                                                      

-5-     

P-->49731st�Page�of�48TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
that  the  difference  between  perceived  risk  and  actual  risk  creates  the
opportunity for profit which can be realized  through thorough  analysis.  There
are no established  markets for some of this  indebtedness and it is less liquid
than more heavily  traded  securities.  Indebtedness  of the debtor company to a
bank are not  securities  of the banks  issuing or selling  them.  The Funds may
purchase loans from national and state  chartered banks as well as foreign ones.
The Funds may invest in senior indebtedness of the debtor companies, although on
occasion  subordinated  indebtedness  may also be  acquired.  The Funds may also
invest in distressed  first mortgage  obligations and other debt secured by real
property.  The Funds do not currently anticipate investing more than 5% of their
respective assets in trade and other claims.                                    

The Funds may enter into  repurchase  agreements  with certain banks or non-bank
dealers. In a repurchase agreement the Fund buys a security at one price, and at
the time of sale,  the seller agrees to  repurchase  that security at a mutually
agreed upon time and price. Repurchase agreements could involve certain risks in
the event of the failure of the seller to repurchase  the  securities as agreed,
which  may  cause a fund to  suffer a loss,  including  loss of  interest  on or
principal of the security,  and costs  associated  with delay and enforcement of
the repurchase  agreement.  Repurchase  agreements  with a duration of more than
seven days are considered illiquid securities.                                  

As a form of borrowing, BARON GROWTH FUND and BARON SMALL CAP FUND may engage in
reverse repurchase agreements with certain banks or non-bank dealers,  where the
Fund  sells a  security  and  simultaneously  agrees  to buy it back  later at a
mutually agreed upon price.  To the extent a Fund engages in reverse  repurchase
agreements it will maintain a segregated  account consisting of liquid assets or
highly  marketable  securities  to cover  its  obligations.  Reverse  repurchase
agreements  may  expose  the Fund to  greater  fluctuations  in the value of its
assets.                                                                         

OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS AND SWAPS 
------------------------------                                                  

BARON ASSET FUND may write  (sell)  covered call options or purchase put options
on equity and/or debt securities. BARON GROWTH FUND and BARON SMALL CAP FUND may
(write)  sell put and covered  call options and purchase put and call options on
equity  and/or  debt  securities.  The Funds may also  enter  into  equity  swap
transactions.  All calls sold by the Funds must be "covered"  (i.e., a Fund must
own the underlying  securities) or must meet the asset segregation  requirements
described  below as long as the call is  outstanding.  Even  though a Fund  will
receive the option  premium to help  protect it against  loss,  a call sold by a
Fund  exposes  that  Fund  during  the term of the  option to  possible  loss of
opportunity  to  realize  appreciation  in the  market  price of the  underlying
security or instrument and may require the Fund to hold a security or instrument
which it might otherwise have sold.                                             

A put option gives the purchaser of the option,  upon payment of a premium,  the
right to sell,  and the writer  the  obligation,  when  exercised,  to buy,  the
underlying  security,  at the exercise  price. A call option,  upon payment of a
premium,  gives the  purchaser of the option the right to buy, and the seller if
exercised,  the  obligation  to sell,  the  underlying  security at the exercise
price.  An American style put or call option may be exercised at any time during
a fixed period while a European  style put or call option may be exercised  only
upon expiration or during a fixed period prior thereto, and the Funds may engage
in either style option.  The Funds are authorized to engage in transactions with
respect to exchange-listed options, over-the-counter options ("OTC options") and
other derivative investments.  Exchange-listed options are issued by a regulated
intermediary such as the Options Clearing Corporation ("OCC"),  which guarantees
the  performance  of the  obligations  of  the  parties  to  such  options.  The
discussion  below uses the OCC as an example,  but is also  applicable  to other
financial intermediaries.                                                       

Rather than taking or making  delivery of the  underlying  security  through the
process of exercising the option,  listed options are usually closed by entering
into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of
the new option.  The Fund's  ability to close out its position as a             

-6-     

P-->49732nd�Page�of�48TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
purchaser  or  seller  of an OCC or  exchange-  listed  put or  call  option  is
dependent,  in part, upon the liquidity of the option market. Among the possible
reasons  for the  absence of a liquid  option  market on an  exchange  are:  (i)
insufficient   trading  interest  in  certain  options;   (ii)  restrictions  on
transactions imposed by an exchange;  (iii) trading halts,  suspensions or other
restrictions  imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or
underlying  securities  including reaching daily price limits; (iv) interruption
of the  normal  operations  of the OCC or an  exchange;  (v)  inadequacy  of the
facilities of an exchange or OCC to handle  current  trading  volume;  or (vi) a
decision by one or more  exchanges to  discontinue  the trading of options (or a
particular  class or series of options),  in which event the relevant market for
that option on that exchange would cease to exist,  although outstanding options
on that exchange would  generally  continue to be exercisable in accordance with
their terms.  The hours of trading for listed  options may not coincide with the
hours during which the underlying instruments are traded. To the extent that the
option  markets  close  before  the  markets  for  the  underlying  instruments,
significant  price and rate movements can take place in the  underlying  markets
that cannot be reflected in the option markets.                                 

OTC  options  are  purchased  from  or  sold to  securities  dealers,  financial
institutions  or  other  parties  ("Counterparties")  through  direct  bilateral
agreement with the Counterparty.  In contrast to exchange-listed  options, which
generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics, all the terms of an
OTC option are  negotiated by the parties.  The Funds expect  generally to enter
into OTC options that have cash  settlement  provisions,  although  they are not
required to do so.                                                              

Equity swap transactions are entered into with financial  institutions through a
direct agreement with the Counterparty,  generally an ISDA Master Agreement, the
specific terms of which are negotiated by the parties.  The Funds may use equity
swaps, or other derivative  instruments,  for hedging purposes against potential
adverse movements in security prices or for non-hedging purposes such as seeking
to  enhance  return.  The  Funds may be  required  to post  collateral  for such
transactions.                                                                   

Unless the  parties  provide  for it,  there is no central  clearing or guaranty
function in an OTC option or derivatives,  including swaps. As a result,  if the
Counterparty fails to make or take delivery of the security, or other instrument
or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in according with the option, the
Fund will lose any  premium  it paid for the  option as well as any  anticipated
benefit of the transaction. The Adviser must assess the creditworthiness of each
Counterparty to determine the likelihood that the terms of the OTC option or the
derivative will be satisfied.  The Funds will engage in OTC option  transactions
and derivatives only with previously approved  Counterparties.  The staff of the
SEC  currently  takes the position  that OTC options  purchased  by a fund,  and
portfolio securities  "covering" the amount of the fund's obligation pursuant to
an OTC  option  sold by it (the  cost of the  sell-back  plus  the  in-the-money
amount,  if any,) are  illiquid,  and are  subject  to a fund's  limitations  on
investments in illiquid securities.                                             

USE OF SEGREGATED  AND OTHER  SPECIAL  ACCOUNTS 
-----------------------------------------------                                 

Many hedging  transactions,  in addition to other  requirements,  require that a
Fund  segregate  liquid high grade assets with its  custodian to the extent Fund
obligations  are not otherwise  "covered"  through  ownership of the  underlying
security or instrument.  In general, either the full amount of any obligation by
the Fund to pay or deliver  securities or assets must be covered at all times by
the  securities  or  instruments  required to be delivered,  or,  subject to any
regulatory  restrictions,  an amount of cash or liquid high grade  securities at
least equal to the current amount of the obligation  must be segregated with the
custodian. The segregated assets cannot be sold or transferred unless equivalent
assets are substituted in their place or it is no longer  necessary to segregate
them.  For  example,  a call option  written by a Fund will require that Fund to
hold the  securities  subject to the call (or  securities  convertible  into the
needed securities without additional  consideration) or to segregate liquid high
grade                                                                           

-7-     

P-->49733rd�Page�of�48TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
securities  sufficient  to purchase  and deliver the  securities  if the call is
exercised.  A put option written requires that the Fund segregate  liquid,  high
grade assets equal to the exercise price. Hedging transactions may be covered by
other means when consistent with applicable regulatory policies.                

INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS 
-----------------------                                                         

BARON ASSET  FUND,  BARON  GROWTH  FUND,  and BARON SMALL CAP FUND have  adopted
investment restrictions,  described below, which are fundamental policies of the
Funds and may not be changed  without the  approval of the Funds'  shareholders.
Unless otherwise noted, all percentage  restrictions are measured as of the time
of the investment after giving effect to the transaction.                       

BARON ASSET FUND may not:

     any of  its  agencies  or  instrumentalities,  if  immediately  after  such
     purchase  more than 5% of the value of the  Fund's  total  assets  would be
     invested  in such  issuer  or the  Fund  would  own  more  than  10% of the
     outstanding voting securities of such issuer,  except that up to 25% of the
     value of the Fund's total assets may be invested  without  regard to the 5%

terminable in more than seven days;                                   
11.  Invest in  securities  of other open end  investment  companies  (except in
     connection with a merger,  consolidation or other reorganization and except
     for the purchase of shares of registered open-end money market mutual funds
     if double advisory fees are not assessed), invest more than 5% of the value
     of the Fund's total assets in more than 3% of the total outstanding  voting
     securities of another  investment  company or more than 10% of the value of
     the Fund's total assets in securities issued by other investment companies;
12.  Participate  on a joint,  or a joint and several,  basis in any  securities

14.  Make  loans to other  persons,  except up to 10% of the value of the Fund's
     total assets in loans of portfolio securities and except to the extent that
     the  purchase  of  publicly  traded  debt  securities  and the  entry  into
     repurchase  agreements in accordance with the Fund's  investment  objective
and policies may be deemed to be loans;                               
15.  Mortgage,  pledge or hypothecate any portfolio  securities owned or held by
     the  Fund,  except  as  may  be  necessary  in  connection  with  permitted

17.  Purchase  securities  of any issuer with a record of less than three years'
     continuous operation, including predecessors,  except obligations issued or
     guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities,  if
     such purchase  would cause the  investments of the Fund in all such issuers
to exceed 5% of the value of the total assets of the Fund; or         
18.  Purchase  or retain  any  securities  of an issuer  any of whose  officers,
     directors,  trustees  or  security  holders is an officer or Trustee of the
     Fund,  or is a member,  officer or  Director of the  Adviser,  if after the
     purchase of the  securities  of such issuer by the Fund one or more of such
     persons owns  beneficially more than 1/2 of 1% of the shares or securities,
     or both, all taken at market value, of such issuer, and such persons owning
    more than  of 1% of such shares or  securities  together own  beneficially
     more than 5% of such  shares or  securities,  or both,  all taken at market

BARON GROWTH FUND and BARON SMALL CAP FUND may not:                             

1.   Issue senior  securities  or borrow money or utilize  leverage in excess of
     25% of its net assets (plus 5% for emergency or other short-term  purposes)
from banks from time to time.

purchase securities on margin or maintain a net short position.       
3.   Purchase or sell  commodities  or  commodity  contracts  except for hedging
     purposes and in conformity  with  regulations  of the  Commodities  Futures

4.   Purchase  or sell oil and gas  interests  or real  estate.  Debt or  equity
     securities  issued by  companies  engaged  in the oil,  gas or real  estate
     business  are  not  considered  oil or gas  interests  or real  estate  for
     purposes  of this  restriction.  First  mortgage  loans  and  other  direct
     obligations  secured by real  estate  are not  considered  real  estate for
purposes of this restriction.                                         
5.   Invest more than 25% of the value of its total assets in any one  industry,
except investments in U.S. government securities.

repurchase agreements maturing in more than seven days.               

As a non-fundamental policy, BARON GROWTH FUND and BARON SMALL CAP FUND         
will not:                                                                       

1.   Invest in securities of other registered  investment  companies  (except in
     connection with a merger,  consolidation or other reorganization and except
     for the  purchase of shares of  registered  open-end  money market funds if
     double advisory fees are not assessed), invest more than 5% of the value of
     the Fund's  total  assets in more than 3% of the total  outstanding  voting
     securities of another  investment  company or more than 10% of the value of
     the Fund's total assets in securities issued by other investment companies.
2.   Invest more than 5% of its total  assets in  warrants  to  purchase  common
stock.                                                                
3.   Purchase the  securities  of any issuer of which any officer or director of
     the  Fund  owns 1/2 of 1% of the  outstanding  securities  or in which  the
officers and directors in the aggregate own more than 5%.             

The Securities  and Exchange  Commission  currently  requires that the following
conditions be met whenever  portfolio  securities are loaned:  (1) the Fund must
receive at least 100% cash collateral  from the borrower;  (2) the borrower must
increase such collateral whenever the market value of the securities rises above
the level of such collateral; (3) the Fund must be able to terminate the loan at
any time; (4) the Fund must receive reasonable  interest on the loan, as well as
any dividends, interest or other distributions on the loaned securities, and any
increase in market value; (5) the Fund may pay only reasonable custodian fees in
connection  with the loan; and (6) while voting rights on the loaned  securities
may pass to the borrower, the Fund's trustees must terminate the loan and regain
the right to vote the  securities if a material  event  adversely  affecting the
investment occurs. These conditions may be subject to future modifications.  The
portfolios of the Funds are valued every day the New York Stock Exchange is open
for trading.                                                                    

With respect to investments in warrants,  the Funds will not invest in excess of
2% of the value of the  particular  Fund's net assets in  warrants  that are not
listed on the New York or American  Stock  Exchanges.  Warrants are  essentially
options to purchase equity  securities at a specified price valid for a specific
period of time.  Their prices do not necessarily  move parallel to the prices of
the underlying securities.  Warrants have no voting rights, receive no dividends
and have no rights with respect to the assets of the issuer.                    

TURNOVER RATE 
-------------                                                                   

The adviser  expects that the average annual  turnover rate of the portfolios of
BARON ASSET FUND and BARON  GROWTH FUND should not exceed 50% and of BARON SMALL
CAP FUND should not exceed 100%.  For the year ended  September 30, 1998,  BARON
ASSET FUND's portfolio  turnover was 23%, BARON GROWTH FUND's portfolio turnover
was 40%,  and Baron Small Cap Fund's  portfolio  turnover  was 59%. For the year
ended  September  30, 1997,  BARON ASSET FUND's  portfolio  turnover was 13% and
BARON GROWTH  FUND's was 25%. The turnover rate  fluctuates  depending on market
conditions.

INVESTMENT ADVISER 
------------------                                                              

The investment  adviser to the Funds is BAMCO, Inc. (the "Adviser"),  a New York
corporation with its principal offices at 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10153
and a subsidiary of Baron Capital Group, Inc.  ("BCG").  Mr. Ronald Baron is the
controlling  stockholder  of BCG and is BAMCO's chief  investment  officer.  Mr.
Baron has over 28 years of experience  as a Wall Street  analyst and has managed
money  for  others  for over 23 years.  He has been a  participant  in  Barron's
Roundtable  and has been a featured guest on Wall Street Week, CNN and CNBC/FNN.
Pursuant  to  separate  Advisory   Agreements  with  each  Fund  (the  "Advisory
Agreement"),  the Adviser furnishes continuous  investment advisory services and
management to each Fund,  including making the day-to-day  investment  decisions
and arranging  portfolio  transactions for the Funds subject to such policies as
the Trustees  may  determine.  BARON

ASSET  FUND  incurred  advisory  expenses  of  $45,074,474  for the  year  ended
September  30, 1998;  $18,573,064  for the year ended  September  30, 1997;  and
$6,923,899  for the year ended  September  30, 1996.  BARON GROWTH FUND incurred
advisory  expenses  of  $4,310,057  for  the  year  ended  September  30,  1998;
$2,828,391  for the year ended  September  30,  1997;  and $994,621 for the year
ended  September 30, 1996.  BARON SMALL CAP FUND incurred  advisory  expenses of
$4,041,420 for the year ended September 30, 1998, its first year of operation.  

Under the  Advisory  Agreements,  the  Adviser,  at its own  expense and without
reimbursement  from the Funds,  furnishes  office space and all necessary office
facilities,  equipment and executive  personnel for managing the Funds, and pays
the salaries and fees of all officers and Trustees who are interested persons of
the Adviser.                                                                    

The Funds pay all operating and other  expenses not borne by the Adviser such as
audit,  accounting and legal fees;  custodian fees;  expenses of registering and
qualifying its shares with federal and state securities commissions; expenses in
preparing  shareholder  reports  and  proxy  solicitation  materials;   expenses
associated with each Fund's shares such as dividend  disbursing,  transfer agent
and registrar fees; certain insurance expenses; compensation of Trustees who are
not  interested  persons  of  the  Adviser;  and  other  miscellaneous  business
expenses.  The  Funds  also pay the  expenses  of  offering  the  shares of each
respective  Fund,   including  the  registration  and  filing  fees,  legal  and
accounting fees and costs of printing the prospectus and related documents. Each
Fund  also  pays all  taxes  imposed  on it and all  brokerage  commissions  and
expenses incurred in connection with its portfolio transactions.                

The  Adviser  utilizes  the  staffs  of BCG and  its  subsidiary  Baron  Capital
Management, Inc. ("BCM") to provide research.  Directors,  officers or employees
of the Adviser  and/or its  affiliates may also serve as officers or Trustees of
the  Funds.  BCM  is an  investment  adviser  to  institutional  and  individual
accounts. Clients of BCM have investment objectives which may vary only slightly
from those of each other and of the Funds.  BCM invests  assets in such clients'
accounts  and in the  accounts  of  principals  and  employees  of BCM  and  its
affiliates in investments  substantially similar to, or the same as, those which
constitute the principal  investments of the Funds. When the same securities are
purchased for or sold by a Fund and any of such other accounts, it is the policy
of the  Adviser  and  BCM to  allocate  such  transactions  in a  manner  deemed
equitable by the Adviser,  and for the  principals and employees of the Adviser,
BCM, and affiliates to take either the same or least favorable price of the day.
All trading by  employees  is subject to the Code of Ethics of the Funds and the
Adviser. In certain circumstances the Adviser may make investments for the Funds
that  conflict  with  investments  being made by BCM.  The Adviser may also make
investment  decisions  for a Fund  that are  inconsistent  with  the  investment
decisions for another Fund.                                                     

Each  Advisory  Agreement  provides that the Fund may use "Baron" as part of its
name for so long as the Adviser serves as investment  adviser to that Fund. Each
Fund  acknowledges that the word "Baron" in its name is derived from the name of
the entities  controlling,  directly and indirectly,  the Adviser,  which derive
their name from Ronald Baron;  that such name is the property of the Adviser and
its affiliated  companies for copyright  and/or other purposes;  and that if for
any reason the Adviser ceases to be that Fund's  investment  adviser,  that Fund
will promptly  take all steps  necessary to change its name to one that does not
include "Baron," absent the Adviser's written consent.                          

Each  Advisory  Agreement  provides  that the Adviser shall have no liability to
that Fund or its shareholders for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for
any loss  suffered  by that  Fund;  provided,  that  the  Adviser  shall  not be
protected  against  liabilities  arising by virtue of willful  misfeasance,  bad
faith or gross negligence,  or reckless  disregard of the Adviser's  obligations
under the Advisory Agreement.

The Advisory Agreements were approved by a majority of the Trustees, including a
majority of the  Trustees who are not  "interested  persons" ( as defined by the
Investment  Company  Act of 1940  ("1940 Act" )) for BARON ASSET FUND on May 11,
1987,  for BARON GROWTH FUND on October 21, 1994 and for BARON SMALL CAP FUND on
July 29, 1997.  BARON SMALL CAP FUND's Advisory  Agreement is for an initial two
year period but the Advisory  Agreements  must normally be approved  annually by
the Trustees or a majority of the particular  Fund's shares and by a majority of
the Trustees who are not parties to the Advisory Agreement or interested persons
of any such party.  With respect to BARON ASSET FUND and BARON GROWTH FUND, such
approval for 1998 was approved at a Board of Trustees  meeting held on April 28,
1998.                                                                           

Each Advisory  Agreement is terminable  without penalty by either the Fund (when
authorized by majority vote of either its outstanding shares or the Trustees) or
the  Adviser  on  60  days'  written  notice.   Each  Advisory  Agreement  shall
automatically  terminate  in the event of its  "assignment"  (as defined by 1940
Act).                                                                           

SERVICE AGREEMENTS                                                              
------------------                                                              

The Funds have  agreements  with  various  service  providers  pursuant to which
administrative  services  such  as  record  keeping,  reporting  and  processing
services are provided to the Funds.                                             

DISTRIBUTOR 
-----------                                                                     

The Funds have a  distribution  agreement  with  Baron  Capital,  Inc.,  ("Baron
Capital" or the  "Distributor")  a New York corporation and a subsidiary of BCG,
located at 767 Fifth Avenue,  New York, N.Y. 10153.  Baron Capital is affiliated
with the  Adviser.  The  Distributor  acts as the  agent  for the  Funds for the
continuous public offering of their shares on a best efforts basis pursuant to a
distribution  plan  adopted  under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act  ("Distribution
Plan").                                                                         

DISTRIBUTION PLAN 
-----------------                                                               

The Distribution Plan authorizes the Funds to pay the Distributor a distribution
fee equal on an annual  basis to 0.25% of the Funds'  average  daily net assets.
The fee was reduced to 0.25% from 0.50% on July 12, 1993. The  distribution  fee
is paid to the  Distributor  in  connection  with  its  activities  or  expenses
primarily intended to result in the sale of shares,  including,  but not limited
to,  compensation  to  registered  representatives  or  other  employees  of the
Distributor;  compensation  to and expenses of employees of the  Distributor who
engage in or  support  the  distribution  of shares or who  service  shareholder
accounts; telephone expenses;  preparing,  printing and distributing promotional
and advertising  material;  preparing,  printing and distributing the Prospectus
and  reports  to other  than  current  shareholders;  compensation  for  certain
shareholder services;  and commissions and other fees to broker-dealers or other
persons  (excluding  banks)  who have  introduced  investors  to the  Fund.  The
distribution fee is payable to the Distributor regardless of the actual expenses
incurred,  although  the  actual  expenses  incurred  by  the  Distributor  have
historically exceeded the distribution fees received by the Distributor.        

If and to the extent the expenses  listed below are  considered  to be primarily
intended to result in the sale of shares within the meaning of Rule 12b-1,  they
are not included in the limits above:  (a) the costs of  preparing,  printing or
reproducing and mailing all required  reports and notices to  shareholders;  (b)
the costs of preparing, printing or reproducing and mailing all proxy statements
and proxies (whether or not such proxy materials include any item relating to or
directed  toward the sale of shares);  (c) the costs of  preparing,  printing or
reproducing   and  mailing  all   prospectuses   and  statements  of  additional
information;  (d) all legal and accounting  fees relating to the  preparation of
any such  report,                                                               

-15-    

P-->49741st�Page�of�48TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
prospectus,  and proxy  materials;  (e) all fees and  expenses  relating  to the
qualification  of the Funds and/or their  shares under the  securities  or "Blue
Sky"  laws  of any  jurisdiction;  (f)  all  fees  under  the  1940  Act and the
Securities Act of 1933,  including fees in connection  with any  application for
exemption  relating to or directed  toward the sale of Shares;  (g) all fees and
assessments,  if any,  of the  Investment  Company  Institute  or any  successor
organization,  whether or not its  activities  are  designed  to  provide  sales
assistance;  (h) all costs of preparing and mailing confirmations of shares sold
or  redeemed  and  reports of share  balances;  (i) all costs of  responding  to
telephone or mail inquiries of shareholders or prospective shareholders.        

The Distribution Plan requires that while it is in effect the Distributor report
in writing, at least quarterly, the amounts of all expenditures, the identity of
the  payees  and the  purposes  for which  such  expenditures  were made for the
preceding fiscal quarter.                                                       

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998, BARON ASSET FUND paid distribution
fees to the Distributor of $11,268,627 (an additional $1,307,832 was absorbed by
the  Distributor  and/or its affiliates and not paid by the Fund pursuant to the
0.25%  limitation);  BARON GROWTH FUND paid distribution fees to the Distributor
of $1,077,515 (an additional  $71,246 was absorbed by the Distributor and/or its
affiliates and not paid by the Fund pursuant to the 0.25% limitation); and BARON
SMALL CAP FUND paid  distribution  fees to the  Distributor  of  $1,010,356  (an
additional  $318,263 was absorbed by the  Distributor  and/or its affiliates and
not  paid by the  Fund  pursuant  to the  0.25%  limitation).  The  distribution
expenses  incurred by the  Distributor  for the fiscal year ended  September 30,
1998 with respect to the three Funds in the aggregate were as follows:          

 (a)  Advertising                                      $         4,900

 (b)  printing and mailing of prospectuses                   2,144,840
to other than current shareholders                        

 (c)  Compensation paid or to be paid to                    10,713,599
broker/dealers                                            

 (d)  Compensation paid to sales and clerical personnel      1,388,560

 (e)  Other                                                    801,940

Trustees of the Funds who were not interested persons of the Funds had no direct
or indirect  financial interest in the operation of the Distribution Plan or the
Distribution Agreement. All the interested Trustees had such an interest.       

The  Distribution  Plan has  been  approved  by the  Funds'  Board of  Trustees,
including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Funds
and who have no direct or indirect  financial  interest in the  operation of the
Distribution  Plan  or in any  agreements  related  thereto.  In  approving  the
Distribution  Plan, the Trustees  considered various factors and determined that
there is a reasonable  likelihood that the Plan will benefit the Funds and their
shareholders.  The  anticipated  benefits  include  the  following:  (i) reduced
expense  ratios due to economies of scale,  (ii) the ability to purchase  larger
blocks  of  securities,   resulting  in  decreased   expenses,   and  (iii)  the
minimization  of adverse  effects from forced sales of portfolio  securities  to
meet redemptions.                                                               

Baron Capital is authorized  to make payments to authorized  dealers,  banks and
other  financial  institutions  who have rendered  distribution  assistance  and
ongoing shareholder support services, shareholder servicing assistance or record
keeping.  Certain  states may require  that any such person be                  

-16-    

P-->49742nd�Page�of�48TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
registered  as a dealer  with  such  state.  The  Funds  may  execute  portfolio
transactions with and purchase securities issued by depository institutions that
receive payments under the Distribution Plan. No preference will be shown in the
selection of investments for the  instruments of such  depository  institutions.
Baron Capital may also retain part of the  distribution  fee as compensation for
its services and expenses in connection with the  distribution of shares.  Baron
Capital's actual expenditures have and will continue to substantially exceed the
distribution  fee received by it. If the  Distribution  Plan is terminated,  the
Funds  will owe no  payments  to Baron  Capital  other  than any  portion of the
distribution  fee accrued  through the effective  date of  termination  but then
unpaid.                                                                         

Unless  terminated in accordance  with its terms,  the  Distribution  Plan shall
continue in effect until,  and from year to year thereafter if, such continuance
is specifically  approved at least annually by its Trustees and by a majority of
the Trustees who are not  interested  persons of the Fund and who have no direct
or indirect  financial  interest in the operation of the Distribution Plan or in
any agreements  related  thereto,  such votes cast in person at a meeting called
for the purpose of such vote.                                                   

The Distribution Plan may be terminated at any time by the vote of a majority of
the members of the Funds'  Board of Trustees who are not  interested  persons of
the Funds and have no direct or indirect  financial interest in the operation of
the Distribution  Plan or in any agreements  related thereto or by the vote of a
majority of the outstanding  shares. The Distribution Plan may not be amended to
increase  materially the amount of payments to be made without the approval of a
majority of the shareholders. All material amendments must be approved by a vote
of the Trustees and of the Trustees who are not interested  persons of the Funds
and have no  direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in the  operation  of the
Distribution  Plan or in any  agreements  related  thereto,  such  votes cast in
person at a meeting called for the purpose of such vote.                        

The Glass-Steagall  Act and other applicable laws, among other things,  prohibit
banks from  engaging  in  business  of  underwriting,  selling  or  distributing
securities.  Accordingly,  the Distributor will enter into agreements with banks
only to provide administrative assistance.  However, changes in federal or state
statues and regulations  pertaining to the  permissible  activities of banks and
their  affiliates,   as  well  as  judicial  or   administrative   decisions  or
interpretations could prevent a bank from continuing to perform all or a part of
the  contemplated  services.  If a bank  were  prohibited  from so  acting,  the
Trustees would consider what actions,  if any, would be necessary to continue to
provide efficient and effective  shareholder  services.  It is not expected that
shareholders  would  suffer any adverse  financial  consequences  as a result of
these occurrences.

The Adviser is responsible for placing the portfolio  brokerage  business of the
Funds with the objective of obtaining the best net results for the Funds, taking
into account  prompt,  efficient and reliable  executions at a favorable  price.
Brokerage transactions for the Funds in exchange-listed  securities are effected
chiefly by or through the Adviser's  affiliate,  Baron Capital,  when consistent
with this objective and subject to the  conditions  and  limitations of the 1940
Act.  Baron  Capital  is a member  of the  National  Association  of  Securities
Dealers,  Inc., but is not a member of any securities exchange.  Transactions in
securities  that trade on NASDAQ or are  otherwise  not listed are  effected  by
broker/dealers  other  than  Baron  Capital.  The Funds do not deal  with  Baron
Capital in any portfolio transaction in which Baron Capital acts as principal.  

The Funds'  Board of Trustees has adopted  procedures  pursuant to Rule 17e-1 of
the 1940 Act which are reasonably  designed to provide that the commissions paid
to Baron  Capital are  reasonable  and fair compared to the  commission,  fee or
other  enumeration  received  by other  brokers in  connection  with  comparable
transactions   involving  similar  securities  being  purchased  or  sold  on  a
securities

exchange  during  a  comparable  period  of  time.  The  Board  reviews  no less
frequently than quarterly that all transactions  effected pursuant to Rule 17e-1
during the preceding  quarter were effected in compliance with such  procedures.
The Funds and the Adviser  furnish  such  reports and  maintain  such records as
required by Rule 17e-1.                                                         

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998, of the total $ 8,178,614 brokerage
commissions  paid by the Funds, $ 5,435,764 were paid to Baron Capital.  For the
fiscal  year  ended  September  30,  1997,  of the  total  $3,307,779  brokerage
commissions paid by Baron Asset Fund and Baron Growth Fund, $2,575,700 brokerage
commissions were paid to Baron Capital.  For the fiscal year ended September 30,
1996, of the total $1,576,882 brokerage commissions paid by Baron Asset Fund and
Baron Growth Fund,  $1,383,564 brokerage commissions were paid to Baron Capital.
The brokerage commissions paid to Baron Capital represent 66.5% of the aggregate
dollar amount of brokerage  commissions  paid and 59.1% of the aggregate  dollar
amount of transactions  involving the payment of commissions for the 1998 fiscal
year. The brokerage  commissions  paid to Baron Capital  represent  77.9% of the
aggregate dollar amount of brokerage commissions paid and 76.4% of the aggregate
dollar amount of transactions  involving the payment of commissions for the 1997
fiscal year. The brokerage  commissions paid to Baron Capital represent 87.7% of
the  aggregate  dollar  amount of  brokerage  commissions  paid and 58.4% of the
aggregate dollar amount of transactions involving the payment of commissions for
the 1996 fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995, of the total
$369,753  brokerage  commissions  paid  by  the  Funds,  $341,336  in  brokerage
commissions were paid to Baron Capital. The brokerage  commissions paid to Baron
Capital represent 92.3% of the aggregate dollar amount of brokerage  commissions
paid and 89.0% of the  aggregate  dollar  amount of  transactions  involving the
payment of  commissions  for the 1995 fiscal year.  Transactions  in which Baron
Capital acted as broker  represents  39% of the  aggregate  dollar amount of all
principal and agency transactions for the Funds for the 1998 fiscal year.       

Under the  Investment  Advisory  Agreements and as permitted by Section 28(e) of
the  Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the Adviser may cause the Funds to pay
a  broker-dealer  (except Baron Capital)  which provides  brokerage and research
services  to the Adviser an amount of  commission  for  effecting  a  securities
transaction  for the Funds in excess of the amount  other  broker-dealers  would
have charged for the  transaction  if the Adviser  determines in good faith that
the greater  commission is consistent with the Funds' policies and is reasonable
in relation to the value of the brokerage and research  services provided by the
executing  broker-dealer  viewed in terms of either a particular  transaction or
the Adviser's overall responsibilities to the Funds or to its other clients. The
term  "brokerage  and  research  services"  includes  advice  as to the value of
securities, the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities,
and the  availability  of securities or of purchasers or sellers of  securities;
furnishing  analyses and reports  concerning  issuers,  industries,  securities,
economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts;
and  effecting  securities  transactions  and  performing  functions  incidental
thereto such as clearance and  settlement.  Such research and information may be
used by the Adviser or its  affiliates to supplement the services it is required
to perform pursuant to the Advisory  Agreement in serving the Funds and/or other
advisory clients of affiliates.                                                 

Broker-dealers may be willing to furnish statistical  research and other factual
information or services to the Adviser for no consideration other than brokerage
or  underwriting  commissions.  Securities  may be bought or sold  through  such
broker-dealers,  but at  present,  unless  otherwise  directed  by the Funds,  a
commission  higher  than one charged  elsewhere  will not be paid to such a firm
solely because it provided research to the Adviser. Research provided by brokers
is used for the benefit of all of the Adviser's or its  affiliates'  clients and
not solely or necessarily for the benefit of the Funds. The Adviser's investment
management  personnel  attempt to evaluate  the quality of research  provided by
brokers.  Results  of  this  effort  are  sometimes  used  by the  Adviser  as a
consideration the in the selection of brokers to execute portfolio transactions.

Baron Capital acts as broker for, in addition to the Funds,  accounts of BCM and
Baron Capital,  including accounts of principals and employees of Baron Capital,
BCM and the Adviser.  Investment decisions for the Funds for investment accounts
managed by BCM and for accounts of Baron  Capital are made  independent  of each
other in light of differing  considerations  for the various accounts.  The same
investment  decision  may,  however,  be made for two or more of the  Adviser's,
BCM's and/or Baron Capital's accounts. In such event,  simultaneous transactions
are inevitable.  Purchases and sales are averaged as to price where possible and
allocated to account in a manner deemed  equitable by the Adviser in conjunction
with BCM and Baron Capital.  This procedure could have a detrimental effect upon
the price or value of the  security  for the  Funds,  but may have a  beneficial
effect.                                                                         

The investment  advisory fee that the Funds pay to the Adviser is not reduced as
a consequence of the Adviser's  receipt of brokerage and research  services.  To
the extent the Funds'  portfolio  transactions are used to obtain such services,
the  brokerage  commissions  paid by the Funds  will  exceed  those  that  might
otherwise  be paid by an  amount  that  cannot  be  presently  determined.  Such
services  would by useful and of value to the Adviser in serving  both the Funds
and other clients and,  conversely,  such services  obtained by the placement of
brokerage  business of other  clients would by useful to the Adviser in carrying
out its obligations to the Funds.                                               

CUSTODIAN,  TRANSFER  AGENT  AND DIVIDEND  AGENT 
------------------------------------------------                                

The Bank of New York,  48 Wall Street,  New York,  NY, is the  custodian for the
Funds' cash and  securities.  DST Systems,  Inc.,  CT-7 Tower,  1004  Baltimore,
Kansas City, MO 64105,  is the transfer  agent and dividend agent for the Funds'
shares.  Neither  institution  assists  in  or  is  responsible  for  investment
decisions involving assets of the Funds.                                        

REDEMPTION OF SHARES 
--------------------                                                            

The Funds expect to make all redemptions in cash, but have reserved the right to
make payment, in whole or in part, in portfolio securities. Payment will be made
other than all in cash if the Funds' Board of Trustees  determines that economic
conditions  exist  which  would make  payment  wholly in cash  detrimental  to a
particular fund's best interests.  Portfolio securities to be so distributed, if
any,  would be selected in the  discretion  of the Funds'  Board of Trustees and
priced as  described  under  "Determining  Your Share  Price"  herein and in the
Prospectus.                                                                     

NET  ASSET VALUE 
----------------                                                                

As more fully set forth in the Prospectus under  "Determining Your Share Price,"
the net asset value per share of each Fund is  determined as of the close of the
New York Stock  Exchange on each day that the Exchange is open.  The Exchange is
open all week days that are not holidays,  which it announces annually. The most
recent  announcement states it will not be open on New Year's Day, Martin Luther
King, Jr.'s Day, Washington's Birthday,  Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence
Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.                                     

Securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange are valued at
the last sale  price of the day as of which such  value is being  determined  as
reflected at the close of the exchange  which is the  principal  market for such
securities.                                                                     

U.S. Government obligations and other debt instruments having sixty days or less
remaining until maturity are stated at amortized cost. Debt instruments having a
greater  remaining  maturity  will be valued at the  highest  bid price from the
dealer  maintaining  an active market in that security or on the basis of prices
obtained from a pricing service approved by the Board of Trustees.

TAXES 
-----                                                                           

Each Fund  intends to qualify  every year as a  "regulated  investment  company"
under  Subchapter  M  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986  (the  "Code").
Qualification  as a regulated  investment  company relieves the Funds of Federal
income  taxes on the  portion of their net  investment  income and net  realized
capital  gains  distributed  to  shareholders.  The Funds  intend to  distribute
virtually all of their net investment  income and net realized  capital gains at
least annually to their respective shareholders.                                

A  non-deductible  4% excise tax will be imposed on a Fund to the extent that it
does not distribute  (including  declaration of certain dividends),  during each
calendar year, (i) 98% of its ordinary  income for such calendar year,  (ii) 98%
of its capital  gain net income (the excess of short and long term  capital gain
over short and long term capital loss) for each one-year  period ending  October
31  and  (iii)  certain  other  amounts  not   distributed  in  previous  years.
Shareholders  will be taxed during each calendar year on the full amount of such
dividends  distributed  (including  certain declared dividends not actually paid
until the next calendar year).                                                  

For Federal income tax purposes,  distributions  paid from net investment income
and from any net realized  short-term  capital gains are taxable to shareholders
as  ordinary  income,   whether  received  in  cash  or  in  additional  shares.
Distributions  paid from net  capital  gains are  taxable as  long-term  capital
gains,  whether  received  in  cash  or  shares  and  regardless  of how  long a
shareholder has held the shares, and are not eligible for the dividends received
deduction.   Distributions  of  investment  income  (but  not  distributions  of
short-term or long-term capital gains) received by shareholders will qualify for
the 70% dividends  received  deduction  available to  corporations to the extent
designated by the Fund in a notice to each  shareholder.  Unless all of a Fund's
gross income constitutes dividends from domestic corporations qualifying for the
dividends  received  deduction,  a portion of the  distributions  of  investment
income to those holders of that Fund which are corporations will not qualify for
the 70%  dividends  received  deduction.  The dividends  received  deduction for
corporate  holders may be further  reduced if the shares  with  respect to which
dividends are received are treated as  debt-financed or deemed to have been held
for less than forty-six (46) days.                                              

The Funds will send written notices to shareholders regarding the Federal income
tax status of all  distributions  made  during  each  calendar  year as ordinary
income or capital gain and the amount qualifying for the 70% dividends  received
deduction.                                                                      

The foregoing  relates to Federal  income  taxation.  Distributions  may also be
subject to state and local taxes.  The Funds are  organized  as a  Massachusetts
business trust.  Under current law, so long as the Funds qualify for the Federal
income tax  treatment  described  above,  it is  believed  that they will not be
liable for any income or franchise tax imposed by Massachusetts.                

Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisers  regarding the application
of Federal, state and local tax laws.

GENERAL 
-------                                                                         

BARON ASSET FUND is an open-end  investment  company  organized as a series fund
and  established  under  the  laws of The  Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  by a
Declaration  of Trust dated  February  19,  1987,  as amended.  The three series
currently available are BARON ASSET FUND, BARON GROWTH FUND, and BARON SMALL CAP
FUND.  Shares  entitle  their  holders  to  one  vote  per  share.  Shares  have
non-cumulative  voting rights,  which means that holders of more than 50% of the
shares voting for

the election of Trustees can elect all Trustees and, in such event,  the holders
of the remaining  shares voting for the election of Trustees will not be able to
elect  any  person  or  persons  as  Trustees.  Shares  have  no  preemptive  or
subscription rights, and are transferable.                                      

SHAREHOLDER AND TRUSTEE LIABILITY 
---------------------------------                                               

Under  Massachusetts  law,  shareholders of a Massachusetts  business trust may,
under  certain  circumstances,  be held  personally  liable as partners  for the
obligations  of  the  trust.  The  Declaration  of  Trust  contains  an  express
disclaimer of  shareholder  liability for acts or obligations of the Fund or any
series  thereof.  Notice  of such  disclaimer  will  normally  be  given in each
agreement,  obligation  or  instrument  entered into or executed by the Funds or
Trustees.  The Declaration of Trust provides for  indemnification  by a Fund for
any loss  suffered by a  shareholder  as a result of an obligation of that Fund.
The Declaration of Trust also provides that a Fund shall,  upon request,  assume
the defense of any claim made against any  shareholder  for an act or obligation
of that Fund and satisfy any judgement thereon.  Thus, the risk of a shareholder
incurring  financial  loss on account  or  shareholder  liability  is limited to
circumstances in which the Fund itself would be unable to meets its obligations.
The Trustees believe that, in view of the above, the risk of personal  liability
of shareholders is remote.                                                      

The  Declaration of Trust further  provides that the Trustees will not be liable
for  errors  of  judgement  or  mistakes  of  fact or law,  but  nothing  in the
Declaration  of trust  protects a trustee  against  liability to which he or she
would otherwise be subject by reason of willful  misfeasance,  bad faith,  gross
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his or
her office.

Advertisements  and other  sales  literature  for the Funds may refer to average
annual total return and actual  return.  Average annual total return is computed
by finding the average  annual  compounded  rates of return over a given  period
that would equate a  hypothetical  initial  investment to the ending  redeemable
value thereof, as follows:                                                      

P(1+T)^ = ERV                 
Where:         P  = a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000                    
T  = average annual total return                  
^ = number of years                             
       ERV = ending redeemable value at the end of the period of a
            hypothetical $1,000 investment made at the beginning
of the period                           

Actual return is computed by measuring  the  percentage  change  between the net
asset value of a hypothetical  $1,000 investment in the Fund at the beginning of
a period and the net asset value of that investment at the end of a period.  The
performance data used in advertisements  does not give effect to a 2% contingent
deferred sales charge that is no longer applicable.                             

All  performance  calculations  assume  that  dividends  and  distributions  are
reinvested  at the net asset

Mutual funds can help lower investing risks

Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.

LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp.").

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
