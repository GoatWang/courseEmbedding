Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are research studies that test or improve ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases. Trials may be designed to study new drugs, surgical procedures or devices, or new ways to use or combine existing options. A clinical trial may give you access to innovative therapies or technologies before they are available anywhere else.



Patients at the Stanford Neuroscience Health Center have access to more than 50 clinical trials, many of them available only at Stanford or very few hospitals in the country. If you would like assistance searching for trials, call 650-498-7425.

Why NKI
Vestibular and Balance
-Statistics and Resources
 mTBI and Concussion
-Statistics and Resources





 




Vestibular and Balance The vestibular system is the dominant source of information  for our perception of orientation and movement in space, and is often a  contributor to dizziness and balance disorders. The National Institutes  for Health reports that 90 million Americans go to health care providers  because of vertigo, dizziness or balance problems. It is the second most  common complaint in the doctor’s office, and will occur in 70% of the nation's  population at sometime in their lives.  Particularly with the expansion of our elderly  population, the need for neuro-otologic diagnostics continues to grow.   

 
Our Solutions

                        NKI pioneered the development of vestibular and  neuro-otologic test equipment; manufacturing the first computerized rotation  chair in the late 1970’s.  As patient  care evolved, the  rotational chair has become but one piece of the diagnostic test batteries  incorporated in NKI’s family of I-Portal® clinical products.  

                        The bottom line is  the same for any practice – providing superior care to ensure positive patient  outcomes.  Generate growth and earn new  referrals by pushing the standard of care in your market and positioning  yourself as a leader in vestibular diagnostics.

                        Unlike  many devices, I-Portal® products pay for themselves; providing direct revenue  through 7 CPT codes.  In  addition, there is significant opportunity for ancillary revenue through  patient examinations and referrals to other practice areas.

                        NKI systems are found in hospitals, trauma centers, private clinics, DOD  and VA facilities and are used by audiologists, ENT’s, neuro-otologists, neuro-ophthalmologists,  and neurologists all over the world.

Answers
                              Fast
The  first step to any successful medical treatment is knowledge and understanding.   Patients,
                                understandably, want to know:



                                  What's
                                    wrong with me?                            
                                

                                  What
                                    can be done to cure it?                            
                                

                                  What
                                    are the options?                            
                                
When
                                    will I feel better?                            
                                

And that's where we come in.

                                Our range of neuro-otologic diagnostic  devices can give your doctor fast, accurate results that enable him or her to  understand your situation and then determine a course of treatment that is  realistic and appropriate. 

                                What's more, utilizing our devices  can help you avoid time-wasting and unnecessary procedures that may not provide  real answers. For example, many patients who complain about dizziness are sent  for several MRI examinations. And while one MRI exam may be necessary, subsequent  tests often provide no additional insight at all.

                                So how can the individual patient,  like you, put our devices and testing procedures to work?

                                First, arm yourself with knowledge.  Below are links to a external Web sites that offer a wealth  of information about the human neurologic, otologic and ophthalmologic systems.  We invite you to spend some time reviewing these sites to better prepare  yourself to speak to your doctor about a new approach to testing.

                                And then, do ask your doctor: Is  neuro-otologic or vestibular testing appropriate for me? How can we make it  happen?

mild Traumatic Brain Injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)  is the result of a blunt blow, jolt or blast overpressure to the head that  disrupts brain function.  The terms mild  TBI (mTBI) and concussion are commonly used interchangeably, and have been  linked with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  The severity of head injuries  range from a brief change in mental status or consciousness to extended  unconsciousness and amnesia.  In severe  or multiple concussion cases, personality changes can occur with devastating  results.  
The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that at least 3.17 million  Americans currently have a long-term or lifelong need for help to perform  activities of daily living as a result of a TBI.  Currently there is no accepted clinical  method to objectively detect mTBI. 


Our Solutions

                      Note: Investigational use only.  Neuro Kinetics, Inc. does not have FDA clearance for 
                      mTBI or concussion indications.  
NKI’s comprehensive I-Portal®  neuro-otologic test devices are in wide use as a diagnostic tool for early  disease detection by audiologists, ENT’s, neuro-otologists, neuro-ophthalmologist,  and neurologists all over the world.  The  same multimodal tool is being used in research investigations to detect mTBI and to monitor  recovery from head trauma.
The  I-Portal® tests are neuro-physiologic; measuring the eye's response to  various motion, oculomotor, and optokinetic stimuli.  Early data shows I-Portal® tests can  detect abnormalities resulting from head trauma even when structural imaging  technologies show no damage.  The test battery also suggests the  data is significantly more objective than current neuro-psychological tests  that rely partially on patient self diagnosis.

                        NKI is  collaborating with military and sports medicine researchers to study new  methods to objectively diagnose and monitor blast and blunt force head trauma.Our battery of tests can help  examiners make better  return to play and return to duty decisions.

I-Portal®  NOTC currently in use at 36 Department of Defense (DOD) and Veterans  Administration (VA) hospitals to detect TBI and mTBI, and to monitor  recoveries.
Part  of multiple DOD research studies on mTBI.


                        Sports Medicine Concussion Research 

With  support from a major health system, we are in the midst of an important high  school athlete study to refine and validate the I-Portal® test battery.  NKI is collecting base line data at the  beginning of the sports season to compare post trauma for head injuries sustained  during the season.
Co-authored  paper on head trauma that resulted from a bicycle accident.  The case study presented a unique opportunity  to compare pre and post trauma data and monitor the healing process.  (Read Here)

  Department of Health and Human ServicesPublic Health ServiceFood and Drug Administration PHILADELPHIA DISTRICT900 U.S. Customhouse2nd and Chestnut StreetsPhiladelphia, PA 19106Telephone: 215-597-4390  WARNING LETTER13-PHI-29  Via United Parcel Service  September 11, 2013  John Howison SchroederCEONeuro Kinetics, Inc.128 Gamma DrivePittsburgh, PA 15238-2920 Dear Mr. Schroeder: During an inspection of your firm located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on May 13, 2013, through May 17, 2013, an investigator from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your firm manufactures the I-Portal® Neuro Otologic Test Center (NOTC), the I-Portal® 4D Video Oculography System (VOG), and the I-Portal® Video Nystagmography System (VNG). Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body. Our inspection revealed that the I-Portal® Neuro Otologic Test Center (NOTC), is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). The device is also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the device into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). Specifically, your firm failed to notify the agency that you intended to introduce into interstate commerce the (b)(4) CDs that your firm distributes with the I-Portal Neuro Otologic Test Center (NOTC). As cleared in K083603, this device should provide its output to a clinician for his/her determination of the clinical significance of the data. With a normative database, the device is providing its interpretation of whether the data it captured are representative of a normal range. Providing normative data, in any form (e.g., installed on your device, on a CD, for download over the internet), for use with your device is a significant change to the technological characteristics of the device that requires submission of a new marketing application. For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. [21 CFR 807.81(b)] The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the device is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed. Your firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Please notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (including any systemic corrective actions) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter. Additionally, we request that you contact the FDA to set up a regulatory meeting to discuss violations set forth in this Warning Letter. Your firm’s response should be sent to: Kirk D. Sooter, District Director, Room 901 U.S. Customhouse, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19106-2973. If you have any questions about the content of this letter please contact: Richard C. Cherry, Compliance Officer, at (215) 717-3075 (phone) or Richard.Cherry@FDA.HHS.GOV. Finally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance. Sincerely yours,/S/                                                       Kirk D. SooterDistrict DirectorPhiladelphia District

Features









A 3D Look Inside the Brain
Stanford Health Care is using a new software system that combines imaging from MRIs, CTs and angiograms to create a three-dimensional model that physicians and patients can see and manipulate—just like a virtual reality (VR) game.




Doctor Stories
Jeffrey Dunn, MD: Why I Went into Medicine
Jeffrey Dunn once thought science was just memorizing facts. Then, an inspiring teacher offered another viewpoint: Find answers to science’s open questions.










Clinical Trials
