Gravy Analytics and Qualia Announce that Qualia Will Contribute its Consumer Intent Signals to Gravy's Geo-Signals Cloud
Jul 25 17
Gravy Analytics and Qualia announced that Qualia will contribute its consumer intent signals to Gravy's geo-signals cloud. In turn, Gravy will provide signal cleansing and location-based insights using its patented AdmitOne's platform. The agreement will allow Qualia to enhance its consumer device graph with Gravy's consumer behavioral data. The additional consumer intent signals that Qualia provides will allow Gravy to scale the behavioral insights that power Gravy's solutions. The partnership allows Qualia to create a more holistic view of consumer interests, both online and offline, through the addition of Gravy's location-based behavioral insights. Qualia's cross-device graph gives clients a comprehensive understanding of mobile device, consumer and household relationships. Unlike standard web cookies, Qualia's IDs are persistent, ensuring that the cross-device graph becomes stronger and more accurate over time. Qualia is the only company utilizing intent data to inform its cross-device graph.


Gravy Analytics Announces Partnership Agreement with adsquare
Jun 19 17
Gravy Analytics announced the availability of Gravy Audiences through adsquare's audience management platform (AMP). The partnership enables marketers using AMP to use Gravy's unique location-based audiences for their programmatic advertising campaigns. Gravy's location-based audiences give marketers the added context and precision of event attendance. While other location-based audiences let marketers reach consumers observed at Madison Square Garden, Gravy Audiences enable marketers to reach those that attended a New York Liberty game, a Billy Joel concert or a WWE Live event. Gravy's interest-based audiences like ‘NBA Basketball Fans’, ‘Pop Music Fans’ and ‘Sports Fanatics’ let marketers target only those consumers likely to be interested in their offer. Marketers can also create more engaging campaigns that speak directly to mobile consumers' specific interests and activities. Gravy Analytics analyzes consumer attendances at more than 10 million places and 1 million events to create its lifestyle, enthusiast and in-market audiences. Consumer attendances are verified at places and points-of interest across the U.S. including retail stores, restaurants, hotels and more. The company tracks both national and local events, ranging from major league sports and music concerts, to small community events and happy hours. Gravy also monitors industry-related events and builds B2B audiences that let marketers reach industry professionals. The company offers more than 200 ready-to-use mobile audiences.

Gravy Analytics




























We Are Gravy

Our Story

 

In 2011, Gravy Analytics recognized that mobile, location-based marketing was going to disrupt the marketing and analytics paradigm.  And it has.  With the industry poised to pass $55 billion and mobile media consumption surpassing desktop, mobile location has arrived.




But for marketers, successful location-based marketing goes beyond simply knowing where consumers are at. Success requires context and quality underlying data. That’s what Gravy Analytics is all about.




Marketers need context to understand why consumers go where they do. The local events and activities we choose to engage in delivers that context – providing insight into our lifestyles, interests and affinities. That’s why we maintain the largest database of local events and activities in the U.S. From it we deliver real-world consumer intelligence for advertisers and brands.



We also recognize that location-based context is only as valuable as the quality of the data used to create these insights.  Gravy Analytics built the first and only location verification engine, AdmitOne, to eliminate poor location signals and deliver the most conclusive consumer audiences and insights available.  And as always, Gravy puts consumer privacy at the center of everything we do.



 




“Knowing that an individual frequents a farmers’ market every Saturday can tell you they’re into fresh food and are likely to have more than a passing interest in cooking. Moreover, information about the local events consumers attend is valuable to businesses near those events for offer-targeting. And Gravy has built the largest database of local events in the U.S. to do that.”
 Senior analyst, Gartner

We use a variety of DBMS types, file types and analytical tools. We use Java, node.js and Python when it fits. We do everything in the Cloud.

Our analytic processes scan millions to billions of data points to generate the intelligent insights we supply to our customers.



Gravy Analytics is currently partnering with leading media, retail, and hospitality companies to increase engagement, activation and sales through the insights we generate. We enable personalized messaging to users so that organizations can communicate with consumers on the topics they are really interested in. We provide the data that powers other data product providers as well as our own data products.
