General Overview


About Maverick Drilling and Exploration 
Maverick is an independent oil company with large acreage positions on the Texas Gulf Coast and its own fleet of drilling and completion rigs. The company was a drilling contractor for more than three decades and is relatively new to the exploration and production industry. Listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, Maverick markets its securities in the United States through American Depositary Receipts (ADRs).Growth PlanDrill low-cost, low-risk oil wells to develop the Blue Ridge oil fieldBuild a new E&P Management TeamEstablish financial structure and capacity to support acquisitionsIdentify, acquire, develop and manage a balanced portfolio of oil and gas assets in the Lower 48 states





Strategy
Maverick spent 35 years as a drilling contractor and is very new to the exploration and production business. The new management team commenced in late 2013 and now has brought a full exploration and production focus to the company.A solid base on which to build:The Blue Ridge Dome, which produces between 1,000 and 2,000 barrels of premium-priced oil per day. Maverick operates the field with a near 100 percent gross working interest (GWI) and a 75 percent net revenue interest (NRI)Additional hard assets, including five owned drilling rigs and 10 completion rigs that are fit for purpose for Blue RidgeManagement commitment to investors to change the focus from activity to value. This will be done by decreasing Blue Ridge costs while maintaining productivity and by capturing new assets via exploration, farm-ins and acquisitions





Vision
Build a growing, multi-asset, investment-grade oil and gas companyKey Actions:Optimize the development of Blue RidgeBuild a professional E&P management team to manage multiple assetsScreen and pursue acquisition of additional assets in multiple basins.Steps Taken:New E&P management team on boardNew functional management in finance, exploration, drilling, procurement, land, M&A and HSEBanking options being finalizedDeal funding opportunities maturingBeginning asset screeningU.S. ADR listing commencedNear-term Steps:Build finance and technical systemsBegin acreage, deal screening: Material positions in undeveloped/re-developable acreage with geology Maverick understandsPrepare for multi-asset operations





Assets
The Blue Ridge Dome is a piercement-type salt dome located just south of Houston. Since its discovery in 1919, the field has produced more than 24 million barrels of oil from less than 1,200 acres. Early Blue Ridge Dome wells routinely produced at rates upward of 1,000 barrels of oil per day.The field comprises multiple channel sands that require aggressive well spacing to fully deplete. Development of the remaining oil is challenging technically but is being addressed with modern geoscience and engineering applications.Maverick's 2,329 net acres are in the eastern half of the field at high working interest.Maverick has acquired data from the field's first-ever 3D seismic survey. The field is being developed with five active drilling rigs that are uniquely owned by Maverick.

Freedom Oil and Gas Ltd Key Developments

Freedom Oil and Gas Ltd. Provides Update on its Second Horizontal Eagle Ford Shale Well
Jul 4 17
Freedom Oil and Gas Ltd. announced the successful drilling of its second well, the Wilson BE #2, on its Dimmit County, Texas acreage. This well, like the first, targeted the Eagle Ford Shale and has a lateral length of approximately 6,800 feet. Both wells were drilled with the Patterson-UTI Drilling Company rig 266. Hydraulic fracturing operations using advanced completion technology for both wells are expected to commence in July 2017 once the drilling rig has been dismantled and removed from the location. Production facilities are being built simultaneously and both wells are expected to be placed on production in August 2017.


Freedom Oil and Gas Ltd Provides Update on its First Horizontal Eagle Ford Shale Well
Jun 12 17
Freedom Oil and Gas Ltd. announced that it has successfully drilled its first well, the Wilson BE #1, on its Dimmit County, Texas acreage targeting the Eagle Ford Shale. This first well was initially drilled as a vertical pilot hole that was used to gather information, and then was subsequently converted to a horizontal wellbore in the Eagle Ford shale. The pilot hole was drilled to a vertical depth of approximately 6,900 feet where extensive well logs and side wall cores were taken. The results showed rock properties more favourable than expected. The horizontal lateral was then successfully drilled to approximately 7,000 feet. The drilling rig is now skidding to the second well and will commence the drilling of the Wilson BE #2 from the same drilling pad. Hydraulic fracturing operations for both wells are expected to commence after the drilling rig has been removed from the pad, and advanced completion techniques will be utilized. Following completion, both wells are expected to be placed on production immediately and begin flowback to clean up the wells for product sales. While drilling the vertical pilot of the #1 well, Freedom obtained substantial information for the purposes of planning the horizontal section and better understanding the geological and reservoir details of the surrounding area for future development purposes. The Company obtained data which confirmed that the well has significant oil in place and high oil mobility, in addition to affirming that the depths and thickness of the Eagle Ford formation appears as expected.


Freedom Oil and Gas Initiates the Drilling of its First Horizontal Eagle Ford Shale Well
May 22 17
Freedom Oil and Gas Ltd. announced that it has commenced the drilling of the first well on its Dimmit County, Texas acreage targeting the Eagle Ford Shale. The well, Wilson BE #1, is the first of two wells to be drilled by Patterson-UTI Drilling Company LLC, Rig 266. The two wells will be drilled consecutively from the same surface site over approximately the next 30 to 40 days. The Wilson BE #1 well will initially be drilled as a vertical pilot hole through the full Eagle Ford formation, which is approximately 400 feet thick in this portion of Dimmit County. Special well logging, side wall cores and petrophysical analysis will be taken from this vertical pilot hole. After this analysis is complete the well will be converted to a horizontal well in the selected Eagle Ford formation interval. The second well, Wilson BE #2, will be drilled subsequently as a horizontal Eagle Ford well with no pilot hole. Once both wells are drilled, the wells will be hydraulically fractured using advanced completion techniques.

3 reasons for hope for Maverick Drilling and Exploration Ltd

Bruce Jackson | May 1, 2014        
    









Shares in Maverick Drilling and Exploration Ltd (ASX: MAD) are plumbing 52-week lows, down 10% to 25 cents, after the junior oil producer released its quarterly report for the period ended 31 March 2014.

Gross oil production for the quarter fell 17% versus the December quarter due to the decline of some higher rate wells.

In early April Maverick presented an updated strategy to investors, and successfully completed a $20.4 million placement at 31 cents per share. Today the shares trade at just 25 cents, a 20% discount to that placing of just a month ago.

It looks like investors are rapidly losing…

Shares in Maverick Drilling and Exploration Ltd (ASX: MAD) are plumbing 52-week lows, down 10% to 25 cents, after the junior oil producer released its quarterly report for the period ended 31 March 2014.
Gross oil production for the quarter fell 17% versus the December quarter due to the decline of some higher rate wells.
In early April Maverick presented an updated strategy to investors, and successfully completed a $20.4 million placement at 31 cents per share. Today the shares trade at just 25 cents, a 20% discount to that placing of just a month ago.
It looks like investors are rapidly losing patience with this former high flyer. I sold my last tranche of Maverick shares just under a year ago, having pocketed huge gains on the way up. Luck’s a fortune.
Although Maverick shares are down and out today, there is cause for hope. Here are three reasons…
1) Management. New CEO and Chairman J. Michael Yeager is the ex-Chief Executive of the BHP Billiton Limited (ASX: BHP) Petroleum division. He would have gone into this role with his eyes wide open, presumably confident he could turn the company’s reported massive oil reserves into meaningful and exciting levels of oil production.
2) On the same management theme, Mr Yeager is building a full exploration and production management team “capable of managing multiple assets.” Key appointments have already been made, with the company looking to add staff in the areas of reservoir engineering, geoscience and land management.
3) Time. Maverick is a company in transition. It is now focusing on improving Blue Ridge to a cash positive asset, building the management team, and screening for new growth opportunities. But it will take time, something an impatient stock market usually doesn’t afford a former market darling.
An investment in Maverick is an investment in Mr Yeager — you are effectively betting on his management experience and skills to turn this Maverick company around.
A much better bet than Maverick
It's tempting to take a punt on Maverick, particularly with the stock trading at just 25 cents, down 80% from its 2012 high.
A stock I already own is also one the Motley Fool's top analysts have tapped as their number one stock pick for 2014 and beyond. This small-cap growth stock flies under the radar, yet is rapidly growing, and has a long runway ahead. The fully franked dividend is the icing on the cake -- something you won't get with Maverick.

I own the stock, and think you should too.

Why Maverick Drilling and Exploration Ltd’s shares are sinking

Mike King | July 8, 2014 | More on:  MAD










Oil producer Maverick Drilling and Exploration Ltd (ASX: MAD) has seen its shares fall more than 20% today to as low as 16 cents, after the company announced some major changes including how it reports oil reserves.

Oil reserves slashed

In the past, Maverick had touted that it had more than 100 million barrels of oil in reserves ? worth more than US$1 billion at current oil prices ? but new CEO Mike Yeager has dramatically slashed that to 27.1 million barrels from its Blue Ridge field, and a further update could see reserves cut even lower.

Oil producer Maverick Drilling and Exploration Ltd (ASX: MAD) has seen its shares fall more than 20% today to as low as 16 cents, after the company announced some major changes including how it reports oil reserves.
Oil reserves slashed
In the past, Maverick had touted that it had more than 100 million barrels of oil in reserves – worth more than US$1 billion at current oil prices – but new CEO Mike Yeager has dramatically slashed that to 27.1 million barrels from its Blue Ridge field, and a further update could see reserves cut even lower. Mr Yeager was previously BHP Billiton Limited’s (ASX: BHP) petroleum boss, so has plenty of experience behind him.
Going forward, the company will exclude any proved reserves at its Boling and Nash fields, which last reported 75.2 million barrels in reserves in 2012. That will surely cast doubt over the validity of the company’s oil reserves at all three of its fields.
It was one of the major concerns we had with the company – whether the reserves were credible  – and it’s one reason why we advised Motley Fool Share Advisor members to sell Maverick in May 2013, when the price was around 60 cents.
Asset sales coming?
Mr Yaeger has also announced a new focus for the company, and acreage that would not be drilled for many years will be released as the lease terms expire. Reviews of the Boling field suggest the company could better spend its money elsewhere, and it could be offloaded in the near future. A similar analysis is taking place at the Nash field over the next six months.
Given recent asset sales in some of the US shale regions, Maverick could realise significant value from the sale of its assets. Companies like Sundance Energy Limited (ASX: SEA), AWE Limited (ASX: AWE) and Red Fork Energy Limited (ASX: RFE), could also be sitting on valuable assets, with substantial acreages in US shales.
The New Maverick
Most of the old senior management have left, including joint CEOs Don Henrich and Brad Simmons, and Yaeger has installed virtually a whole new management team at the top. The ‘new’ Maverick is already looking like a completely different company, but it will likely take some time to turn around its financial performance.

A much better bet than Maverick
It's tempting to take a punt on Maverick, particularly with the stock trading under 20 cents, but here's a much better option...
One the Motley Fool's top analysts have tapped as their number one stock pick for 2014 and beyond. This small-cap growth stock flies under the radar, yet is rapidly growing, and has a long runway ahead. The fully franked dividend is the icing on the cake -- something you won't get with Maverick.
