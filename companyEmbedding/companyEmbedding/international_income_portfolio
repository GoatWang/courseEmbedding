Returns are annualized for periods greater than one year.
Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance is not a guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance of the Portfolio may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. The Portfolio imposes a 2% redemption fee on shares held 90 days or less. Performance data does not reflect the redemption fee. If reflected, total returns would be reduced.
Investment performance reflects fee waivers and in the absence of these waivers investment performance would be reduced.

Returns are annualized for periods greater than one year.
Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance is not a guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance of the Portfolio may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. The Portfolio imposes a 2% redemption fee on shares held 90 days or less. Performance data does not reflect the redemption fee. If reflected, total returns would be reduced.
Investment performance reflects fee waivers and in the absence of these waivers investment performance would be reduced.

Invest through your broker or adviser,or invest directly













Please click here for Index Definitions. 
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Portfolio invests in foreign securities, which will involve greater volatility and political, economic, and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. It also invests in emerging markets, which involve unique risks, such as exposure to economies less diverse and mature than the US or other more established foreign markets. Economic and political instability may cause larger price changes in emerging markets securities than other foreign securities. Such risks may be magnified for securities in frontier emerging markets. Investing in participation notes involve the same risks associated with a direct investment in the underlying security, currency or market.  
Portfolio holdings are subject to review and adjustment in accordance with the Portfolio's investment strategy and may vary in the future, and should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security. The Portfolio is actively managed therefore holdings may not be current. A complete list of holdings is available here.
While the Portfolio is "no load", management fees and expenses will apply. Please refer to the Prospectus for additional details.

27917287949



Objective
This Portfolio seeks to provide an attractive level of income and is suitable for investors willing to invest for a minimum of 5 years.


Risk level
Risk Category 2: For the investor who is only willing to take modest risk, where there may be some fluctuation in capital value and or income returns. You may not receive back the amount invested.


Policy


This Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective through a diversified portfolio of collective investments, giving exposure mainly to less volatile investments, a high proportion of which will be fixed interest funds.


There is also a diversified element of medium to higher risk growth investments mainly made up of equity funds and International Property including those which invest internationally. 




 


What you'll be investing in


A significant proportion of the portfolio will be invested in index tracker funds. These funds aim to provide investors with the same return as the underlying market but may not necessarily perform in exactly the same way as the index they are tracking due to the impact of charges.


The remainder of the portfolio will be invested in funds which do not track an index and these funds will be more actively managed.


The funds and the fund managers utilised within the Portfolio may vary and full details are available from your Financial Adviser.

Funds to build a monthly income portfolio for retirement
FE Trustnet’s head of content Joshua Ausden draws on the various equity income funds recommended by experts to create a portfolio that pays dividends monthly.

Neil Woodford’s belief that equities should be the natural home for investors in retirement has been supported by a number of industry experts. While the typical funds recommended in later life are low in risk, Woodford & co point out that a retiree at 65 or even 70 may well have at least a 15-year time horizon and can therefore afford to take on the volatility associated with equities. Chelsea Financial’s Darius McDermott goes a step further, insisting that longer life expectancy makes capital growth a necessity for investors in retirement. Without it, investors may end up not having a big enough pot of money to draw income from, he says.If investors are considering using equity income for their retirement plan and are looking for monthly dividends, they’ve got to make sure they have their bases covered. The typical equity income fund pays a dividend twice or four times a year, which means it’s crucial to hold a basket of different products that deliver an income at different times of the year.One possible option is to go for a specialist monthly-income paying equity income fund. Five funds across the UK Equity Income and UK All Companies sectors throw out dividends 12 times a year, with a further two in IA Global Equity Income and IA Europe ex UK. From a total return point of view, the five crown-rated Threadneedle UK Monthly Income fund is a standout performer, achieving top quartile returns over one, three and 10-year periods, and second quartile performance over five years. Jonathan Barber has generated an attractive level of income too, delivering £274.77 income from an initial £1,000 investment in the five years to January 2015.Income earned from £1,000 2010-2015   Source: FE AnalyticsLike all funds of this kind, Barber has a bias towards large-cap defensive companies. Top-10 positions include GlaxoSmithKline, Shell, Imperial Tobacco and AstraZeneca. Close Brothers is the only FTSE 250 company in the top-10.While the fund has performed strongly in capital growth terms, investors who are looking to maximise their income may be tempted by the Insight Equity Income Booster fund. Managers Tim Rees and Takis Anastassopoulos use call options to enhance their yield at the expense of potential capital growth. This has resulted in the fund posting bottom quartile returns in IA UK Equity Income over three and five years, though between 2010 and 2015 it has delivered more in dividends that any of its rivals, just pipping Schroder Income Maximiser to the post with £442.19. Pictet High Dividend Selection is the only monthly-paying income fund with a decent track record, but it has neither impressed from an income or capital growth point of view.While certainly useful, experts agree that it’s probably wise not to rely solely on one fund to generate a monthly income. A fund such as Threadneedle UK Monthly Income works as a core holding, but it’s important to diversify both capital growth and dividend risk across a number of different managers and strategies.  Industry experts have highlighted both UK Equity Income and Global Equity Income funds that fit the bill for retirement investors in recent weeks, which pay an income at different times of the year. Using these and others recommended by FE Research and Square Mile, it’s possible to create a portfolio of equity income funds that pay a dividend every month. January, April, July, OctoberLet’s start with a fund that a number of experts including Parmenion’s Meera Hearnden tipped as being the ideal holding for an income portfolio: Trojan Income. FE Alpha Manager Francis Brooke’s £2.1bn fund has a consistent track record of protecting capital on the downside, which is seen as a standout characteristic. FE data shows it has been the least volatile fund in the entire IA UK Equity Income sector over the past decade and has the lowest max drawdown by almost 10 percentage points. In 2008, the fund lost 12.14 per cent – less than half as much as its sector average.  Risk-return of UK Equity Income funds over 10yrs  Source: FE AnalyticsIt’s still delivered enough on the upside to post top-quartile returns over five and 10-year periods, and is one of only two funds that haven’t cut their annual dividend since 2008. The fund pays dividends twice a year, at the end of September and March, meaning it covers the months of October and April. The yield currently stands at 3.69 per cent. Another fund rated highly by the experts is Rathbone Income, which manager Carl Stick has run since 2000. Like Brooke, Stick prioritises capital protection, though is more willing to venture down the market-cap scale and hold small and mid-caps.  The manager acknowledges that he made mistakes in the lead up to the financial crisis in 2008, holding too much in economically sensitive companies. He insists he has learnt from his errors, however, and now always ensures his fund is adequately protected. Outperformance in the challenging years of 2011 and then 2014 has been welcomed. Dividends are paid in the middle of December and June, and therefore could be used to cover the months of January and July. Rathbone Income is currently yielding 3.4 per cent and has out a similar level of income as Trojan Income over the past five years or so. While Stick (pictured) and Brooke are highly rated managers, there’s always a need to diversify both your income stream and capital. Dividend-paying UK companies have had a great run in recent years, but whether that can continue remains up for debate.Global Equity Income funds that invest in other developed economies are effective diversification tools. The increasingly popular Artemis Global Income fund is tailor made in this regard, intentionally allotting only a small amount to the UK. Manager Jacob de Tusch-Lec’s biggest regional allocations are to continental Europe and the US at 41 and 27 per cent respectively. Asia Pacific also has sizeable exposure at 15 per cent.The fund pays out dividends just in time for the start of April and October, and is currently yielding 3.3 per cent. De Tusch-Lec has performed very well since the fund’s launch back in 2010 from an income and capital growth point of view, delivering top decile returns of 108.76 per cent. The one question mark hanging over the fund is the fact that it’s yet to be tested in a severe down market.  For the months of January and July, Guinness Global Equity Income in a possible option, and one rated very highly by Thesis’ Steven Richards.  The fund, which is yielding 3.2 per cent, has the advantage of being smaller and nimbler than the other choices mentioned here. It has a strong record since its launch in 2010, performing strongly in both rising and falling markets, though has delivered a below average level of income over five years. February, May, August, NovemberSchroder Income Maximiser is perhaps the most popular income fund that uses call options to enhance its yield. The £1.2bn portfolio has consistently yielded more than 7 per cent since launch, and is second only to Insight Equity Income Booster for income in recent years. Unlike its Insight rival, however, the fund has also impressed from a capital growth and total return point of view, outperforming its FTSE All Share benchmark over one, three and five-year periods. Performance of fund, sector and index over 3yrs   Source: FE AnalyticsBut the fund doesn’t protect as effectively on the downside as the likes of Insight or Fidelity Enhanced Income. Managers Nick Kirrage and Kevin Murphy are deep value investors, targeting dirt-cheap companies that they believe are set for a re-rating. Such an approach may not be suitable for low-risk investors, illustrated by the fund’s poor showing in 2011 when it lost almost 10 per cent.Aberdeen World Equity Income, which also pays dividends at the end of January, April, July and October, could be used to diversify an investor’s income stream. Headed up by star manager Bruce Stout, the global team at Aberdeen has had a very tough time in recent years, thanks in no small part to an underweight position in the US and an overweight to South America. Still, the team remains highly rated by experts and diversifies a UK/US heavy portfolio. A yield of 4 per cent and a strong dividend record in recent years are also attractive attributes.  March, June, September, DecemberAmong the options for investors looking for dividends covering March, June, September and December include the highly-rated duo of CF Woodford Equity Income and Newton Global Higher Income.Both Neil Woodford and James Harries pride themselves on being cautious investors, and indeed both are currently worried by the numerous headwinds facing risk assets at present. The former’s concerns are expressed in a recent interview with FE Trustnet. Their defensive stance has historically seen them underperform during fast rising markets, but outperform during falling ones. Overall, they’re both well up against their peers over the long term.Performance of managers and peer groups over 10yrs   Source: FE AnalyticsUnusually for a UK Equity Income fund, Woodford has sizeable exposure to international markets. US and European companies make up more than 14 per cent of assets. Newton Global Higher Income adds an extra layer of diversification, allocating 44 per cent of assets to the US and 33 per cent to Europe. The managers have a bias towards large-cap companies with predictable earnings and strong cash flow. Healthcare is Woodford’s favoured sector, whereas Harries prefers consumer products. CF Woodford Equity Income and Newton Global Higher Income are yielding 4 per cent and 3.37 per cent respectively, and both pay dividends at the end of February, May, August and November. In an upcoming series of articles, FE Trustnet will create monthly income paying portfolios for differing risk profiles, including one purely from investment trusts.

In-depth fundamental company research is paramount to the team’s bottom-up stock selection process with emphasis on companies with high or improving Returns on Operating Capital Employed, recurring cash flows and capable management. This investment discipline is maintained by strict adherence to the team’s longstanding investment process and cash-flow-based valuation criteria.

Class A shares include maximum front-end sales charge of 5.50% (Alternatives), 5.25% (Equity) and 4.25% (Fixed Income).  Class B shares include deferred sales charge of 5.00% which declines to zero after sixth year.  Class C shares include deferred sales charge of 1.00% which declines to zero after first year. Class L shares, Class I, and Class IS shares are not subject to a sales charge.
Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/ or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the fund's current prospectus. The minimum initial investment is $5,000,000 for Class I shares.

 Shares of the portfolio redeemed within 30 days of purchase will be subject to a 2% redemption fee, payable to the portfolio. The redemption fee is designed to protect the portfolio and its remaining shareholders from the effects of short-term trading.  

 The Fund has suspended offering Class L shares of the Portfolio to all investors. 
Class IS shares, are  being offered only to eligible investors who must meet a minimum initial investment of $10,000,000 or be a defined contribution, defined benefit or other employer sponsored employee benefit plan, whether or not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), in each case subject to the discretion of the Portfolio's investment advisor.
Growth of Investment illustration is based on an initial investment of $10,000 made since fund inception, assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but does not include sales charges and fees. Performance would have been lower if sales charges and fees had been included. Results are hypothetical.

 Subject to change daily. Fund information, Portfolio Composition and Characteristics are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the region presented. 

 Returns are net of fees and assume the reinvestment of all dividends and income. Returns for less than one year are cumulative (not annualized). Performance of other share classes will vary.

 Please keep in mind that double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.

PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS DEFINITIONS 
 Price/earnings (P/E) is the price of a stock divided by its earnings per share. Sometimes called the multiple, P/E gives investors an idea of how much they are paying for a company’s earning power. The higher the P/E, the more investors are paying, and therefore the more earnings growth they are expecting.
Subject to change daily.  Portfolio information, composition, and characteristics are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the sectors presented.  Monthly holdings are updated 15 calendar days after month-end.
NTM = Next Twelve Months.

Turnover is sourced from the fund's current prospectus.

 The index data displayed under allocations are calculated using MSIM and other third-party methodologies and may differ from data published by the vendor.

Forecast and estimates are subject to change and may not necessarily come to pass due to changing market and/or economic conditions.

RISK/RETURN DEFINITIONS 
Active share is the fraction of the portfolio or fund that is invested differently than its benchmark as of the last day of the reporting period. A portfolio with a high degree of Active share does not assure a fund’s relative outperformance. Alpha is the excess return or value added (positive or negative) of the portfolio’s return relative to the return of the benchmark. Beta is a measure of the relative volatility of a security or portfolio to the market's upward or downward movements. A beta greater than 1.0 identifies an issue or fund that will move more than the market, while a beta less than 1.0 identifies an issue or fund that will move less than the market. The Beta of the Market is always equal to 1. Information ratio is the portfolio’s alpha or excess return per unit of risk, as measured by tracking error, versus the portfolio’s benchmark. R squared measures how well an investment’s returns correlate to an index. An R squared of 100 means the portfolio performance is 100% correlated to the index’s, whereas a low r-squared means that the portfolio performance is less correlated to the index’s. Sharpe ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated as the ratio of excess return to standard deviation. The Sharpe ratio determines reward per unit of risk. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the historical risk-adjusted performance. Standard deviation measures how widely individual performance returns, within a performance series, are dispersed from the average or mean value. Tracking error is the amount by which the performance of the portfolio differs from that of the benchmark.

RISK CONSIDERATIONS 
 There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this strategy. Please be aware that this strategy may be subject to certain additional risks. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. Investments in small- and medium- capitalization companies tend to be more volatile and less liquid than those of larger, more established, companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risk).
Morningstar
 Rankings: The percentile rankings are based on the average annual total returns for the periods stated and do not include any sales charges, but do include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains and Rule 12b-1 fees. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1.
Ratings: The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Ratings do not take into account sales loads.

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.

  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.
