Cotton Creek Capital Management is acquiring Royal Baths Manufacturing Company, a maker of acrylic and marble bathroom products. Cotton Creek will make the acquisition through its second fund.
Press Release
Cotton Creek Capital Management II, LLC through its private equity fund, Cotton Creek Capital Partners II, L.P., is pleased to announce the acquisition of Houston, Texas-based Royal Baths Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (“Royal”). Royal is a leading developer, manufacturer, and marketer of acrylic and cultured marble bathroom products, including soaker and whirlpool bathtubs, vanity tops, sinks, shower walls and bases.
Founded in 1969, Royal has developed long-standing customer relationships with many of the nation’s leading homebuilders through its robust product offering and flexible, mass customization manufacturing capabilities. Royal serves its customers via manufacturing operations in Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth, with additional facilities in Austin, San Antonio, and Orlando, Florida.
“For over 40 years, Royal has built its leadership position with a steadfast focus on servicing the demanding requirements of the nation’s homebuilders. Through service and quality, Royal has become the product of choice within the Texas and Florida residential construction markets. We are excited to partner with the management team at Royal to provide resources in support of continued growth,” commented Cotton Creek Managing Director, Antonio J. DiGesualdo. 





The acquisition of Royal represents the second platform investment of Cotton Creek Capital Partners II, L.P., Cotton Creek’s second standalone private equity fund, and a continuation of its investment strategy of partnering with privately-held lower, middle-market businesses in the Southern United States.

With a broad product line that includes both acrylic and cultured marble products, Royal has pioneered a unique, direct to builder strategy. This approach is supported by custom manufacturing and installation services via facilities throughout Texas and Florida. For more information, visit Royal Bath’s website at www.royalbaths.com.
