Evolution of Dr Pepper Snapple
Dr Pepper Snapple was formed in 2008 with the spinoff of Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages (or CSAB) from Cadbury Schweppes Plc. Formed in 2003, Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages combined Cadbury Schweppes’ four North American beverage businesses, namely Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc., Snapple Beverage Corp., Mott’s LLP, and Bebidas Mexico, bringing more than 50 leading brands under its portfolio.



The company’s flagship brand, Dr Pepper, a nonalcoholic beverage with a unique blend of 23 flavors, was created in 1885 by a pharmacist named Charles Alderton.
Competitive scenario
In an industry highly dominated by The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), Dr Pepper Snapple has rapidly emerged as the third-largest soft drink maker in the United States. In addition to the two behemoths, the company also competes with Nestlé S.A., Kraft Foods Group Inc. (KRFT), Campbell Soup Company (CPB), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST), and Cott Corporation (COT).
Instead of having exposure to only one company, you can diversify your holdings through ETFs. For instance, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP) has holdings in beverage companies such as Dr Pepper Snapple, PepsiCo, and Coca-Cola.
In this series on Dr Pepper Snapple, we’ll discuss the company’s products, growth strategy, distribution strategy, recent performance, and future prospects.

Formerly called Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages, on May 5, 2008, it was spun off from Britain's Cadbury Schweppes, with trading in its shares starting on May 7, 2008.

History[edit]
Beverage America and Select Beverages bottlers were purchased from the Carlyle Group in February 1998.[6] Snapple, Mistic and Stewart's (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc Companies, Inc. to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45 billion.[7] In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc.[8]
In 2006 and 2007, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, along with several other regional bottlers. This allowed DPS to bottle many of its own beverages and combat the recent decision by many Pepsi and Coke bottlers who had dropped their Dr Pepper and Snapple products to promote new product additions from Pepsi and Coke. Some of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up brands are still licensed to Pepsi, Coke and independent bottlers in various regions of the United States and Canada.
In November 2007, Cadbury Schweppes announced it would take the beverages unit public. In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes demerged its beverage holdings forming the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group holds naming rights to Dr Pepper Ballpark and the Dallas Stars' practice facility, the Dr Pepper Star Center, both of which are located in Frisco, Texas. It also retains non-alcoholic beverage rights to each facility's concessions as a result of the deals as well as sponsorships with the NHL franchise.
In 2008, Dr Pepper Snapple Group purchased minority interest in Big Red, Inc, makers of Big Red, NuGrape, Nesbitt's and other flavored drinks.[9]
In 2014, the company announced that it accomplished its goal of reducing use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in its plastic bottles. Dr Pepper Snapple lowered the amount of PET in its bottles by over 60 million pounds between 2007 and 2014.[10]
On November 22, 2016 it was announced that Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group had made a cash purchase of Bai Brands for the price of $1.7 billion. It had previously purchased a minority stake in the company for $15 million in 2015.[11]

Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. is an American soft drink company, based in Plano, Texas. Formerly called Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages, on May 5, 2008, it was spun off from Britain's Cadbury Schweppes, with trading in its shares starting on May 7, 2008. Cadbury Schweppes plc went on to become Cadbury plc on May 5, 2008.[4][5]

History[edit]
Beverage America and Select Beverages bottlers were purchased from the Carlyle Group in February 1998.[6] Snapple, Mistic and Stewart's (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc Companies, Inc. to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45 billion.[7] In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc.[8]
In 2006 and 2007, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, along with several other regional bottlers. This allowed DPS to bottle many of its own beverages and combat the recent decision by many Pepsi and Coke bottlers who had dropped their Dr Pepper and Snapple products to promote new product additions from Pepsi and Coke. Some of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up brands are still licensed to Pepsi, Coke and independent bottlers in various regions of the United States and Canada.
In November 2007, Cadbury Schweppes announced it would take the beverages unit public. In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes demerged its beverage holdings forming the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group holds naming rights to Dr Pepper Ballpark and the Dallas Stars' practice facility, the Dr Pepper Star Center, both of which are located in Frisco, Texas. It also retains non-alcoholic beverage rights to each facility's concessions as a result of the deals as well as sponsorships with the NHL franchise.
In 2008, Dr Pepper Snapple Group purchased minority interest in Big Red, Inc, makers of Big Red, NuGrape, Nesbitt's and other flavored drinks.[9]
In 2014, the company announced that it accomplished its goal of reducing use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in its plastic bottles. Dr Pepper Snapple lowered the amount of PET in its bottles by over 60 million pounds between 2007 and 2014.[10]
On November 22, 2016 it was announced that Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group had made a cash purchase of Bai Brands for the price of $1.7 billion. It had previously purchased a minority stake in the company for $15 million in 2015.[11]

DPS’ TEN Products Struggling?CEO stands behind line extensionBy 

Steve Holtz,
Editor in Chief, CSP Daily News










August 23, 2013
PLANO, Texas -- Beverage stock analyst Bonnie Herzog is sounding an alarm about sales of Dr Pepper’s TEN product extensions, while Dr Pepper Snapple Group executives are standing behind the line.“Although we conceptually believe in DPS’ TEN platform, we are becoming increasingly concerned about the continued underperformance of TEN,” Herzog wrote in a research note this week. “While this platform does offer an alternative to traditional diet [soft drinks], we fear the failure to sufficiently differentiate it from this struggling category is weighing on results.”The TEN line includes reformulated versions of Dr Pepper, 7UP, RC and other DPS brands with only 10 calories per serving. The rollout of the beverage line is expected to be complete by the end of this summer.Dr Pepper Snapple Group’s low calorie offerings “posted its worst performance in over a year,” Herzog reported, “with dollar sales down 5.4% as units declined 4.9%.” She estimates the TEN lineup had similar results.DPS president and CEO Larry Young, however, said during an earnings call in July that a deeper look at Nielsen data shows a benefit from the TEN line."Based on Nielsen home scan research, we know that 51% of TEN's purchases are incremental to the CSD category, meaning that we are achieving our goal of bringing lapsed and new users into the category," Young said. "We are really pleased with these early results."DPS spokesperson Chris Barnes echoed Young's comments, telling CSP Daily News, "Dr Pepper TEN is a product we believe in and are continuing to invest in to drive consumer trial and awareness."Related Content
