(JAMN) to Launch New Product LinesApr. 15, 2011 10:21 AM ETYesterday, Jammin Java Corp. announced that it will be releasing new product lines in conjunction with its exclusive distributor National Coffee Service & Vending. The new products will be unveiled at their booth, #470-474, at the second annual NAMA OneShow, a convention specializing in the vending/coffee service industry. The products shown at OneShow will be available for sale starting in May.Jammin Java is a U.S.-based company that supplies premium coffee products wholesale to service, hospitality and office industries as well as big box stores, intended for use in break rooms. NCS&V has recently partnered with Jammin Java as a distributor, and represents suppliers in the office coffee and vending industries, offering products to the U.S. and Canada.For NAMA OneShow, Jammin will show off their new lines of single-serve and bulk coffee and tea products, including coffee and tea pods, frac pacs and bags of whole beans. This will be the first time tea is offered as part of the Jammin product line, and will include the tea pod flavors Citris White, Masala Chai, and Rooibos Citron. Flavors for Jammin’s coffee pods will be Lions Blend, Kingston City Roast, and Mountain Roast Decaf; these flavors will also be represented in the frac pac and 2.2 lb whole bean bags. “We are extremely excited for the launch of our new products, especially our single serve coffee pods,” said Rohan Marley, Chairman of Jammin Java Corp. “The first thing that drew me to this single serve pod is that it is one of the most environmentally friendly single serves I’ve personally seen as it is both compostable and biodegradable. However, just as important, we are going to be offering a better quality cup of coffee at a better price when we go to market.”Please see disclaimer on QualityStocks website: disclaimer.qualitystocks.netFollow QualityStocks and get email alerts

The brand name Jammin Java is the product brand.  It's already established in the market place. The company made the right move to settle, and now they can move forward without a black cloud hindering their efforts ..    Peeps are ready to get back to business!!!  Also, JAMN does not need Marley...JAMN had to pay his huge salary, royalties and stock...that era is over...A NEW ONE HAS STARTED. The company has developed a line of products under the Jammin Java name, which we will distribute through our existing channels with a planned in the current Q. This line of product will feature premium coffee in a number of formats, including ground, whole bean, and Keurig, Nespresso, and Dolce Gusto compatible single serve capsules. Brent Toevs, the companys former CEO is now running the Jammin Javas outside sales force to bring this line into several distribution channels that include OCS and grocery stores. We have already discussed our new brand with current and potential customers and have received positive feedback and commitments to order once we launch. These products will not require the company to pay licensing fees.
