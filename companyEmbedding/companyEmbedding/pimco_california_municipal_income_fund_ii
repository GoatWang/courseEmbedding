			Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Funds
			


		About Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt

		Tax-exempt municipal bonds are debt issued by a state, city, or other municipality for general governmental needs or to finance special
		projects. These municipal bonds pay interest that is free from regular federal income tax, and state-specific bonds can provide residents
		of those states with income free from state and, in some cases, local income taxes as well.* Tax-exempt municipal bonds can be an
		advantageous alternative to taxable investments, particularly for investors in higher tax brackets. To make a fair comparison between
		a tax-free investment like a municipal bond and a taxable investment, one should adjust the tax-free investment's yield to account
		for money saved in regular federal, and sometimes state, income tax.
	

* Interest on out-of-state bonds and dividends paid by national funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Income may also be
			subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.



				About Nuveen Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Closed-End Funds

				Nuveen offers several national tax-exempt municipal bond closed-end funds, and as well as state-specific funds focusing 15 different states. Municipal Closed-End
				Funds can potentially help you balance your desire for income and growth by:

Meeting current expenses with monthly tax-free income;
Potentially realizing attractive, long-term, after-tax total returns;
Diversifying your income portfolio;
Reducing the amount of your investment income subject to taxes.

				You can see you would need to earn much more from a taxable investment to match a municipal bond's after-tax yield. For instance,
				if your fund is yielding 5.00% tax-free and your tax rate is
				28%, you would need a taxable investment to yield 6.94% to match the same after-tax cash flow. 
			

This chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to reflect past or predict future performance 
				for any particular investment. They do not take into account the effects of the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) 
				or capital gains taxes.  This information is general in nature and should not be considered tax advice.  
				Nuveen is not a tax advisor and investors should consult with a qualified tax consultant as to their particular 
				situation.






						Investor Profile

						Are these CEFs right for you?

						The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:


							Potential for attractive, monthly tax-free income

							Diversification of a portfolio otherwise comprised of taxable fixed-income
							and equity securities

							Reduction of the amount of investment income subject to taxes.


						What are potential risks?


							Municipal bond fund income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will
							be subject to capital gains tax.

							Municipal bonds are subject to interest rate risk, or the risk
							that the bonds will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.

							Municipal bonds are also subject to call risk, and credit risk.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

			Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Funds
			


		About Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt

		Tax-exempt municipal bonds are debt issued by a state, city, or other municipality for general governmental needs or to finance special
		projects. These municipal bonds pay interest that is free from regular federal income tax, and state-specific bonds can provide residents
		of those states with income free from state and, in some cases, local income taxes as well.* Tax-exempt municipal bonds can be an
		advantageous alternative to taxable investments, particularly for investors in higher tax brackets. To make a fair comparison between
		a tax-free investment like a municipal bond and a taxable investment, one should adjust the tax-free investment's yield to account
		for money saved in regular federal, and sometimes state, income tax.
	

* Interest on out-of-state bonds and dividends paid by national funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Income may also be
			subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax.



				About Nuveen Tax-Exempt Municipal Debt Closed-End Funds

				Nuveen offers several national tax-exempt municipal bond closed-end funds, and as well as state-specific funds focusing 15 different states. Municipal Closed-End
				Funds can potentially help you balance your desire for income and growth by:

Meeting current expenses with monthly tax-free income;
Potentially realizing attractive, long-term, after-tax total returns;
Diversifying your income portfolio;
Reducing the amount of your investment income subject to taxes.

						13.25%
					



				You can see you would need to earn much more from a taxable investment to match a municipal bond's after-tax yield. For instance,
				if your fund is yielding 5.00% tax-free and your tax rate is
				28%, you would need a taxable investment to yield 6.94% to match the same after-tax cash flow. 
			

This chart is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to reflect past or predict future performance 
				for any particular investment. They do not take into account the effects of the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT) 
				or capital gains taxes.  This information is general in nature and should not be considered tax advice.  
				Nuveen is not a tax advisor and investors should consult with a qualified tax consultant as to their particular 
				situation.






						Investor Profile

						Are these CEFs right for you?

						The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:


							Potential for attractive, monthly tax-free income

							Diversification of a portfolio otherwise comprised of taxable fixed-income
							and equity securities

							Reduction of the amount of investment income subject to taxes.


						What are potential risks?


							Municipal bond fund income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will
							be subject to capital gains tax.

							Municipal bonds are subject to interest rate risk, or the risk
							that the bonds will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.

							Municipal bonds are also subject to call risk, and credit risk.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
