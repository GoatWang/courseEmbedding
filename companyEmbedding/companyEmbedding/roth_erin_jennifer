Surname meaning for "Roth"
German and Jewish (Ashkenazic): nickname for a person with red
hair, from Middle High German rot, German rot
‘red’. As a Jewish surname it is also at least partly ornamental: its
frequency as a Jewish surname is disproportionate to the number of
Jews who, one may reasonably assume, were red-headed during the period
of surname adoption.
