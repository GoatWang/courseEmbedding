This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Toll, a founder, in June.Q  How is the first year as C.E.O.?A I’ve been with the company for 20 years, and I’ve been reporting directly to Bob for 20 years, so the transition was pretty easy.Q  What’s Bob’s role now?A Bob’s executive chairman.I’m running the company day to day. But when it comes to major personnel issues or a major strategic decision, including the review of land opportunities, Bob gets involved.

Q  Have you instituted any changes?A In terms of strategy, very little has changed. We’re still a luxury builder; we’re still looking to take advantage of the more than $1 billion in cash that we have and buy land now to set up the future. Continue reading the main story

Q  Have you been buying much land with these reserves?A In 2010 we spent $430 million on new land all over the country.We purchased four properties out of the WCI bankruptcy, one of which is Rivington in Danbury, Conn. We bought about 1,000 remaining home sites that are left in Rivington that WCI had started before they went bankrupt. Within a month or two we will start construction on our models.Q  How many projects is Toll Brothers working on?A The company has 200 communities open for sale right now. We own land for another couple hundred that we’re either waiting for a better market or we’re processing approvals or permits. In addition, there are, at any given time, probably 50 to 100 deals that are out there percolating.Q  Let’s talk about projects in the New York area, starting with the Dumbo, Brooklyn, condominium.A We started construction in October. We’ll be starting sales in September, then occupancy the summer of 2012. It will probably average about $800 a square foot, so studios could be $500,000 and penthouses up to $2 million.Q  How about the  Touraine?   A At 65th and Lexington, it’s our first building on the Upper East Side. It’s a boutique building with 23 units — actually 22, since we just combined a couple of units on the top floors. Construction began in the fall. We’re probably going to open for sale in the fall of 2011, and the building will deliver late summer or fall of 2012. The price point there is $2,000 a foot.

Q  Have you sold most of the units at 303 East 33rd?A We began sales when Lehman Brothers tanked in 2008, so prices came down. But in the last year they’ve gone back up. We’re about 90 percent sold.Q  How is the New York market faring?A Toll Brothers City Living — which for us is Hoboken, Jersey City, Manhattan and Brooklyn — is our best market in the country.

Prices from a year ago are up 5 to 10 percent, though they’re still not back to what they were in ’06.

The average price now is $1 million; nationwide it’s $560,000.Q  How are sales companywide?A The spring selling season historically begins right after the Super Bowl and runs into the middle of April, so now we’re over a month into the season.It’s been pretty good so far. Deposits are up 9 percent from last year. Deposits can take two to five weeks to convert into an agreement.Q  Has the cancellation rate improved?A It’s back down to historical norms, which is about 7 percent, compared with 30 percent during the recession.Q  But it’s still a buyer’s market.A It’s still a buyer’s market, but it’s strengthening a bit. We’re having pricing power in isolated locations like New York City and Hoboken. Prices aren’t falling in other places; they’re just flat.Q  How will changes in the mortgage industry affect business?A If this transitions away from government sponsorship of most mortgages, there’s no question rates will go up, underwriting will become stricter and down payment requirements will get larger. In the long term, that has an effect on affordability.We’re doing a little better because our buyers, on average, put 30 percent down and are very well qualified for mortgages.Q  What are your long-term goals for Toll Brothers?A To enhance the brand, and get bigger. There’s a chance we could announce a deal in China this year.We’re looking to take the City Living brand to Washington and Boston. And in New York, 5 to 10 years from now, we better have half a dozen buildings going up in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Toll Brothers Delivers Unprecedented Virtual Reality Luxury Home Buying Experience
                                                


                                                    GlobeNewswire – 
                                                    9:00 AM ET 07/27/2017
                                                


Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL), the nations leading builder of luxury homes, announced today it has begun to pilot a new tool to allow home buyers to use virtual reality to envision design selections in their homes, and make changes that reflect their preferences.

















                                                    Builder sentiment stumbles to 8-month low on higher lumber costs

National Association of Home Builders indicates post-election lift has faded. Sentiment among home builders slid in July after a stretch of strong months as rising costs for materials started to pinch. The monthly confidence gauge from the National Association of Home Builders fell two points to a reading of 64. June's reading, initially reported as 67, was revised down one point.

                                                    Homebuilder stocks fall after several downgrades at Barclays

Homebuilder stocks slumped broadly Tuesday, after Barclays downgraded several of them, and reiterated a bearish view on some others, citing concerns that valuations suggest investors may be too optimistic in the face of data pointing to moderating buyer traffic trends. Toll Brothers Inc.' s stock shed 1.6% after analyst Michael Dahl downgraded it to underweight from equal weight, while shares of Lennar Corp. (LEN) fell 1.5%, PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) lost 0.6% and TRI Pointe Group Inc....

Shares of home builders were broadly higher, led a surge in D.R. Horton Inc.' s stock, after upbeat data on hiring in the construction industry. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) rallied 1.6%, on track for the biggest one-day rise in four months, with 32 of 35 components gaining ground.
