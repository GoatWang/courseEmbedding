          For Patients        
Being there when you need us, where you need us, is our passion and our privilege. Our teams of doctors, nurses, social workers and chaplains are here to provide you the care you need at the time you need it.





 







Aspire Health’s Services
Living with a serious illness can be challenging for patients and families. There can often be fears about the future, uncontrolled symptoms, confusion about complex medical decisions, and frequent trips to the emergency room or hospital. We are committed to providing an extra layer of support throughout the course of your illness, ensuring that you receive the care you want, in the location you want it, at the time you need it.
Aspire is here to help you and your family.










Your Clinical Team
Aspire Health assigns each patient a specialized team of clinicians that includes a physician, nurse practitioner and – depending upon your needs and preferences – a social worker and chaplain. Our service begins with an initial visit that typically occurs in your home. In this first meeting, your provider will learn about your illness, your goals, symptoms and challenges, and the level of support you have from your family, friends and other caregivers. Based on this information, we will work with you and your physicians to develop a care plan that is focused on your specific needs and goals. Although each care plan is different, most of our care plans include:

Symptom management
Disease management
Coordination with other medical professionals
Communication with family members and other caregivers
Coordination of in-home care and support services
24/7 support

The circumstances surrounding your needs will likely change over time. As they do, we will be there to provide you the care you need and to recommend any appropriate changes to your care plan.
Together, our team will work with you to ensure you achieve your goals and receive the best possible care.








“Having Aspire come to our home has been extremely helpful. The whole staff at Aspire has been very helpful in caring for my father. We are so thankful to have them!”
Ted B, Aspire Patient Family Member

          For Health Plans        
Aspire Health partners with health plans who share our vision of offering patients with serious illness comprehensive, collaborative medical care. Our teams are available 24/7 to support your patients.





 







The Opportunity
Serious illness care is one of the few areas in healthcare where the quality of care for patients can be significantly improved while simultaneously lowering costs. Today, roughly 25% of all traditional Medicare costs are spent in the last year of life. During the last year of life, many patients experience unnecessary or unwanted hospitalizations, skilled nursing facility stays and ER visits, as well as undertake treatments that may conflict with their goals of care and fail to prolong their lives. Patients facing a serious illness also experience severe symptoms like pain, nausea, constipation and shortness of breath that frequently go untreated, and both patients and their families often wrestle with complex emotions including fear, anxiety and grief.










Aspire Health’s Solution
Aspire Health has built a network of specialty palliative care physician practices that provides comprehensive medical care for patients facing a serious illness. Aspire’s team of specialized nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers and chaplains is led by a board-certified palliative care physician. Our clinicians are available 24/7 to support our patients. Aspire’s clinicians are experts in symptom management, patient-family communication, advance care planning, and medical crisis prevention and urgent response.
Although it can be modified to meet the needs of specific health plans, Aspire’s typical service includes:

Outreach to primary care physicians, specialists and other community providers as well as highly predictive clinical and claims-based patient algorithms to identify patients who might benefit from Aspire’s services
A dedicated, individualized care team for every patient that includes a physician and nurse practitioner as well as – depending upon a specific patient’s needs and preferences – a social worker and chaplain
An initial comprehensive assessment by a nurse practitioner that examines all aspects of a patient’s status (e.g. physical, psychosocial, emotional, spiritual) and accurately captures all of a patient’s existing conditions
A personalized, comprehensive care plan for each patient based on that patient’s specific goals and needs; this care plan is developed in consultation with the patient’s PCP and specialists, who are kept up-to-date on and involved in any future changes to the care plan
Frequent, tailored touches from Aspire’s care team based on the patient’s specific needs, including regular visits to the patient’s home
24/7 support to patients, including nurse practitioner home visits any time when necessary
The patient’s status, care plan and progress are tracked through a comprehensive information technology system that can produce a wide variety of reports for patients, caregivers, physicians and health plans









It is so helpful to be able to call when I need something or have a question. My fear factor drops way down. Your care has kept me out of the hospital.
Trudy M, Aspire Patient

          For Physicians        
Aspire Health partners with primary care physicians and specialists who want to offer their patients with a serious illness an extra layer of support.  We would be honored to partner with you.





 







A Partner to PCPs and Specialists
Whether you are a primary care physician or specialist, your goal is to provide the highest quality care to your patients – especially your patients facing a serious illness. At Aspire, we share that goal. We also recognize that all too often it takes tremendous time and resources to provide patients with the around-the-clock home-based support they often need and to have complex medical conversations with your patients and their families. At Aspire, we are here to be your partner in providing an extra layer of support to your patients facing a serious illness.










Aspire Health’s Clinical Team
Our physician practice in each market is led by a board-certified palliative care physician who specialize in caring for patients facing a serious illness. Each of our physicians leads a team of palliative care experts – advanced practice providers, registered nurses, social workers, and chaplains –who visit patients in their homes. We regularly call our patients and families to ensure that we, as well as the patients’ other physicians, are up-to-date on medical conditions and major concerns. We anticipate problems before they occur so we can engage patients, their families, and physicians to prevent crises. However, when problems do occur, our team is on-call 24/7 so that we can respond to a crisis no matter when it happens.








“Is it wonderful to have home visits. It has relieved a lot of anxiety to know we can call whenever we need you.”
Bob A, Aspire Patient
