2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

	Annual Meeting of Stockholders






	June 27, 2012





	 



	 







	PROXY
	STATEMENT




	 



	 




	This Proxy Statement is furnished by the Board of Directors of The European Equity Fund, Inc. (the Board of Directors or
	Board), a Maryland corporation (the Fund), in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Meeting) to be held at 12:00 p.m., New York time, on June 27, 2012
	at 60 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005. The purpose of the Meeting and the matters to be considered are set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders.




	If the accompanying Proxy Card is executed properly and returned, shares represented by it will be voted at the Meeting, and any
	postponement or adjournment thereof, in accordance with the instructions on the Proxy Card. However, if no instructions are specified, shares will be voted FOR the election of two (2) Class I directors of the Fund (Directors)
	nominated by the Board (Proposal 1), FOR the election of one (1) Class III director of the Fund nominated by the Board (Proposal 2), FOR the ratification of the appointment by the Audit Committee and the Board of PricewaterhouseCoopers
	LLP, an independent public accounting firm, as independent auditors for the Fund (Proposal 3). A proxy may be revoked at any time prior to the time it is voted by written notice to the Secretary of the Fund, by submitting a subsequently
	executed and dated proxy or by attending the Meeting and voting in person.




	If a stockholder owns shares of the Fund in
	violation of applicable law, including the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), the Fund may determine that any vote attributable to such shares shall not be counted, or that such shares will not be
	counted for quorum purposes, or both. Under Section 12(d)(1) of the Investment Company Act, the acquisition of more than 3% of the Funds common stock by another fund (whether registered, private or offshore) is unlawful. There is legal
	uncertainty about the operation of Section 12(d)(1) and about the Funds right under federal and state law to invalidate votes cast by any person whose Fund shares are held in violation of law. The Fund, if necessary, may seek judicial
	resolution of the uncertainty in any particular case.




	The close of business on May 11, 2012 has been fixed as the record
	date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. On that date, the Fund had 10,519,284.46 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share will be entitled to one vote on each matter
	that comes before the Meeting. It is expected that the Notice of Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and the form of Proxy Card will first be mailed to stockholders on or about May 21, 2012.




	A quorum is necessary to hold a valid meeting. If stockholders entitled to cast one-third of all votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting
	are present in person or by proxy, a quorum will be established. The Fund intends to treat properly executed proxies that are marked abstain and




	 








	broker non-votes (defined below) as present for the purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved at the Meeting. Under Maryland law, abstentions do not constitute a vote
	for or against a matter and will be disregarded in determining the votes cast on an issue. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular
	matter because the broker does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that matter and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.





	PROPOSALS 1 AND 2:






	ELECTION OF DIRECTORS





	The Funds charter (the Charter) provides that the Board of Directors be divided into three classes of Directors serving
	staggered three-year terms and until their successors are elected and qualify. The term of office for Directors in Class I expires at the 2012 Annual Meeting, Class II at the next succeeding annual meeting and Class III at the
	following succeeding annual meeting. Two Class I nominees, Mr. Detlef Bierbaum and Mr. Robert H. Wadsworth are proposed in this proxy statement for election. If elected, each of the two Class I nominees will serve a
	three-year term of office until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2015 and until his respective successor is elected and qualifies. One Class III nominee, Mr. Richard Karl Goeltz, is proposed in this Proxy Statement for election. If
	elected, Mr. Goeltz will serve a two-year term of office until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2014 and until his successor is elected and qualifies. The Fund regrets that Mr. John H. Cannon, who made significant contributions
	as a Director of the Fund since 2004 and also served as Chairman of the Audit Committee, recently passed away. The size of the Board was reduced by one Class I Director on April 27, 2012 as a result of Mr. Cannons passing.




	As a result of Mr. Werner Walbröls retirement from the Board, each class of Directors of the Board would not
	be of approximate equal size if no further action were taken. Under the Funds By-laws and the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual Rule 304 (NYSE Rule 304), the classes of the Funds board should be of approximately
	equal size. Accordingly, the Funds Nominating Committee nominated Mr. Goeltz to fill a Class III vacancy created by Mr. Walbröls retirement with Mr. Goeltzs resignation from Class I contingent upon his election
	to the Board as a member of Class III. If each nominee is elected, each class of Directors of the Board would be of equal size and in compliance with the requirements of the Funds Bylaws and NYSE Rule 304.




	Should any vacancy occur on the Board of Directors, the remaining Directors would be able to fill that vacancy by the affirmative vote of
	a majority of the remaining Directors in office, even if the remaining Directors do not constitute a quorum. Any Director elected by the Board to fill a vacancy would hold office until the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in
	which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies. If the size of the Board is increased, additional Directors will be apportioned among the three classes to make all classes as nearly equal as possible.




	Unless authority is withheld, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of Proxy Card to vote each Proxy Card for
	the election of the four nominees listed above. Each nominee has indicated that he will serve as a Director if elected, but if any nominee should be unable to serve, proxies will be voted for any other person determined by the persons named in the
	form of Proxy Card in accordance with their discretion. The Board of Directors has no reason to believe that any of the above nominees will be unable to serve as a Director.

	NFORMATION






	The management of the business and affairs of the Fund is overseen by the Board of Directors. Directors who are not
	interested persons of the Fund as defined in the Investment Company Act, are referred to as Independent Directors, and Directors who are interested persons of the Fund are referred to as Interested
	Directors. Certain information concerning the Funds governance structure and each Director is set forth below.






	Experience, Skills, Attributes, and Qualifications of the Funds Directors

	.

	    The Nominating and
	Governance Committee of the Funds Board, which is composed entirely of Independent Directors, reviews the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of potential candidates for nomination or election by the Board, and conducts a similar
	review in connection with the proposed nomination of current Directors for re-election by stockholders. When assessing a candidate for nomination it is the policy of the Nominating and Governance Committee to consider, amongst other criteria,
	whether the individuals background, skills, and experience will complement the background, skills and experience of other nominees and will contribute to the diversity of the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee assesses the
	effectiveness of this policy as part of its annual self assessment. Additional information concerning the Nominating and Governance Committees consideration of nominees appears in the description of the Committee following the table below.




	The Board has concluded that, based on each Directors experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual
	basis and in combination with those of the other Directors, that each Director is qualified and should continue to serve as such. In determining that a particular Director was and continues to be qualified to serve as a Director, the Board has
	considered a variety of criteria, none of which, in isolation, was controlling. In addition, the Board has taken into account the actual service and commitment of each Director during his tenure (including the Directors participation in Board
	and committee meetings, as well as his current and prior leadership of standing and ad hoc committees) in concluding that each should continue to serve. Information about the specific experience, skills, attributes and qualifications of each
	Director, which in each case led to the Boards conclusion that the Director should serve (or continue to serve) as a director of the Fund, is provided in the table following the Risk Oversight section below.




	The Board believes that, collectively, the Directors have balanced and diverse experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills, which
	allow the Board to operate effectively in governing the Fund and protecting the interests of shareholders. Among other attributes common to all Directors are their willingness and ability to commit the necessary time and attention to their duties as
	Directors, their ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them (including information requested by the Directors), to interact effectively with each other and with Deutsche Investment Management Americas
	Inc., the funds administrator (the Administrator), Deutsche Asset Management International GmbH (the Investment Adviser) and other service providers, counsel and the Funds independent registered public accounting
	firm, to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties as Directors. References to the qualifications, attributes and skills of Directors are pursuant to requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, do not
	constitute holding out of the Board or any Director as having special expertise or experience and shall not be deemed to impose any greater responsibility or liability on any Director or on the Board by reason thereof.

	Board Structure and Oversight Function

	.

	    The Board is
	responsible for oversight of the Fund. The Fund has engaged the Administrator and the Investment Adviser to manage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing the Administrator and the Investment Adviser and the
	Funds other service providers in the operations of each Fund in accordance with the Funds investment objective and policies and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of the Investment Company Act and other applicable Federal,
	state and other securities and other laws, and the Funds charter and bylaws. The Board meets in person at regularly scheduled meetings four times throughout the year. In addition, the Directors may meet in person or by telephone at special
	meetings or on an informal basis at other times. The Directors also regularly meet outside the presence of any representatives of the Administrator and the Investment Adviser. As described below, the Board has established five standing
	committees  the Audit, Nominating and Governance, Advisory, Valuation and Executive Committees  and may establish ad hoc committees or working groups from time to time, to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight
	responsibilities. Each committee other than the Executive Committee is composed exclusively of Independent Directors. Each year the Directors evaluate the performance of the Board and its committees. The responsibilities of each committee, including
	its oversight responsibilities, are described further below. The Independent Directors have also engaged independent legal counsel, and may from time to time engage consultants and other advisors, to assist them in performing their oversight
	responsibilities.




	The Chairmans duties include setting the agenda for each Board meeting in consultation with
	management, presiding at each Board meeting, meeting with management between Board meetings, and facilitating communication and coordination between the Directors and management. Mr. Christian Strenger, the Chairman of the Funds Board of
	Directors is an Interested Director as defined in the Investment Company Act because he is a member of the Supervisory Board of a company that is affiliated with the Administrator and the Investment Adviser and because of his ownership of shares of
	the ultimate parent of the Administrator and the Investment Adviser. The Directors believe that it is appropriate for Mr. Strenger to serve as Chairman and that his service benefits shareholders because of his extensive knowledge of the
	investment management industry, the Deutsche Bank organization and the Funds and because he is a leading corporate governance expert in Germany and internationally. In addition, the Directors note that, although Mr. Strenger is an Interested
	Director as defined in the Investment Company Act, he is not involved in the management of the Fund and is not an officer or director of the Administrator or the Investment Adviser. The Independent Directors are satisfied that they can act
	independently and effectively without having an Independent Director serve as Chairman and note that a key structural component for ensuring that they are in a position to do so is for the Independent Directors to constitute a substantial majority
	of the Board. Mr. Goeltz, an Independent Director and Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee, serves as Lead Independent Director for the Fund and as such is available to act as liaison between the Independent Directors and
	management and to consult with the Chairman to the extent deemed appropriate.






	Risk
	Oversight

	.

	    The Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance and operational risks. Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Fund resides with the Administrator and the Investment Adviser
	or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to supervision by the Administrator. The Board has charged the Investment Adviser and its affiliates with (i) identifying events or circumstances the occurrence




	 




	4








	of which could have demonstrable and material adverse effects on the Fund; (ii) to the extent appropriate, reasonable or practicable, implementing processes and controls reasonably designed
	to lessen the possibility that such events or circumstances occur or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do occur; and (iii) creating and maintaining a system designed to evaluate continuously, and to revise as
	appropriate, the processes and controls described in (i) and (ii) above.




	Risk oversight forms part of the
	Boards general oversight of each Funds investment program and operations and is addressed as part of various regular Board and committee activities. Each of the Administrator, the Investment Adviser, and the Funds other principal
	service providers has an independent interest in risk management but the policies and the methods by which one or more risk management functions are carried out may differ from the Funds and each others in the setting of priorities, the
	resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. Oversight of risk management is provided by the Board and the Audit Committee. The Directors regularly receive reports from, among others, management, the Funds Chief Compliance
	Officer, its independent registered public accounting firm, counsel, and internal auditors for the Administrator, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Fund and the Administrators risk management programs.




	Not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified, nor can controls be developed to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or
	effects. The processes and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness, and some risks are simply beyond the reasonable control of the Fund or the Administrator, its affiliates or other service providers.
	Moreover, it is necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Funds goals.

	The following tables show certain information about the nominees for election as Directors and about Directors whose terms will continue,
	including beneficial ownership of Common Stock of the Fund, and about all officers of the Fund. All current Directors resident in the United States own Fund shares. The Fund has elected to be subject to the statutory calculation, notification and
	publication requirements of the German Investment Tax Act (Investmentsteuergesetz) (the Act) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 and intends to elect to be subject to the Act for the fiscal year ending December 31,
	2012. Absent this election, Directors who are German residents would be subject to adverse German tax consequences if they owned shares of a fund organized outside of Germany, such as the Fund, that is not subject to German regulation or tax
	reporting. In light of the Funds election to be subject to the Act, the Board of Directors encourages all Directors of the Fund (including those who are German residents) to invest in the Fund.

	Valuation date is March 31, 2012. The Fund has elected to be subject to the statutory calculation, notification and publication requirements of the German
	Investment Tax Act (Investmentsteuergesetz) (the Act) for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2011 and intends to elect to be subject to the Act for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2012. Absent this election, Directors who are
	German residents would be subject to adverse German tax consequences if they owned shares of a fund organized outside of Germany, such as the Fund, that is not subject to German regulation or tax reporting. In light of the Funds election to be
	subject to the Act, the Board of Directors encourages all Directors of the Fund (including those who are German residents) to invest in the Fund.





	 





	(2)




	The Family of Investment Companies consists of the Fund, The New Germany Fund, Inc. and The Central Europe and Russia Fund, Inc., which are closed-end funds that share
	the same investment adviser and administrator and hold themselves out as related companies.






	The Board of
	Directors presently has five standing committees including an audit committee (the Audit Committee), an advisory committee (the Advisory Committee), an executive committee (the Executive Committee), a nominating
	and governance committee (the Nominating and Governance Committee) and a valuation committee (the Valuation Committee).




	The Audit Committee, currently comprising Messrs. Burt, Goeltz (Chair), Wadsworth, Wagner, Walbröl and Dr. Malt, operates pursuant to a written charter. The Audit Committee charter is
	currently available on the Funds website, www.dws-investments.com. The Audit Committees organization and responsibilities are contained in the Audit Committee Report, which is included in this Proxy Statement, and in its written charter.
	The members of the Audit Committee are independent as required by the independence standards of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is
	financially literate and has determined that each of Messrs. Goeltz, Wadsworth and Wagner meet the requirements for an audit committee financial expert under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Although the
	Board has




	 




	14








	determined that all four meet the requirements for an audit committee financial expert, their responsibilities are the same as those of the other audit committee members. Messrs. Goeltz,
	Wadsworth and Wagner are not auditors or accountants, do not perform field work and are not full-time employees. The SEC has determined that an audit committee member who is designated as an audit committee financial expert will not be
	deemed to be an expert for any purpose as a result of being identified as an audit committee financial expert. The Audit Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. Upon his retirement from the
	Funds Board of Directors, Mr. Walbröl will no longer serve as a member of the Audit Committee.




	The Advisory
	Committee, currently comprising Messrs. Bierbaum, Goeltz, Wadsworth (Chair) and Dr. Malt, makes recommendations to the full Board with respect to the Management Agreement between the Fund and Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc.,
	and the Investment Advisory Agreement between the Fund and Deutsche Asset Management International GmbH. The Advisory Committee met twice during the past fiscal year.




	The Executive Committee, currently comprising Messrs. Burt, Goeltz, Strenger, Wadsworth and Walbröl, has the authority to act for the Board on all matters between meetings of the Board subject
	to any limitations under applicable state law. During the past fiscal year the Executive Committee did not meet. Upon his retirement from the Funds Board of Directors, Mr. Walbröl will no longer serve as a member of the Executive
	Committee.




	The Valuation Committee, currently comprising Messrs. Wadsworth (Chair), Wagner and Walbröl, reviews the
	Funds valuation procedures and makes recommendations with respect thereto and, to the extent required by such procedures, determines the fair value of the Funds securities or other assets. During the past fiscal year the Valuation
	Committee met once. Upon his retirement from the Funds Board of Directors, Mr. Walbröl will no longer serve as a member of the Valuation Committee.




	The Nominating and Governance Committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Burt, Goeltz (Chair), Wadsworth, Wagner, Walbröl (Deputy Chair) and Dr. Malt. The Board has determined that each of
	the members of the Nominating and Governance Committee is not an interested person as the term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act. Generally, the Nominating and Governance Committee identifies, evaluates
	and selects and nominates, or recommends to the Board of Directors, candidates for the Board or any committee of the Board, and also advises the Board regarding governance matters generally and confirms that the Board and Audit Committee undertake
	annual self-evaluations. To be eligible for nomination as a Director a person must, at the time of such persons nomination, have Relevant Experience and Country Knowledge and must not have any Conflict of Interest, as those terms are defined
	in the Funds Bylaws. The relevant portions of the Funds Bylaws describing these requirements are included as Annex A. The Nominating and Governance Committee may also take into account additional factors listed in the Nominating and
	Governance Committee Charter, which generally relate to the nominees industry knowledge, business experience, education, ethical reputation, special skills, ability to work well in group settings and the ability to qualify as an
	independent director. When assessing a candidate for nomination, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers whether the individuals background, skills and experience will complement the background, skills and experience of
	other nominees and will contribute to the diversity of the Board.




	 




	15








	The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider nominee candidates properly submitted
	by stockholders in accordance with applicable law, the Funds Charter or Bylaws, resolutions of the Board and the qualifications and procedures set forth in the Nominating and Governance Committee Charter, which is currently available on the
	Funds website, www-dws-investments.com. A stockholder or group of stockholders seeking to submit a nominee candidate (i) must have beneficially owned at least 5% of the Funds common stock for at least two years, (ii) may submit
	only one nominee candidate for any particular meeting of stockholders, and (iii) may submit a nominee candidate for only an annual meeting or other meeting of stockholders at which directors will be elected. The stockholder or group of
	stockholders must provide notice of the proposed nominee pursuant to the requirements found in the Funds Bylaws. Generally, this notice must be received not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of
	the date of mailing of the notice for the preceding years annual meeting. Such notice shall include the specific information required by the Funds Bylaws. The relevant portions describing these requirements also are included as Annex A.
	The Nominating and Governance Committee will evaluate nominee candidates properly submitted by stockholders on the same basis as it considers and evaluates candidates recommended by other sources. The Nominating and Governance Committee met three
	times during the past fiscal year. Upon his retirement from the Funds Board of Directors, Mr. Walbröl will no longer serve as a member of the Nominating and Governance Committee.




	In accordance with its charter, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews each Directors affiliations and relationships for
	purposes of determining whether or not the Director qualifies as an independent director. The Nominating and Governance Committee also considers each Directors independence more generally, as well as various governance best
	practices, including the suggestion of a non-U.S. corporate governance code that a board of directors should state its reasons if it determines that a director is independent notwithstanding that the director has served for more than nine
	years from the date of his first election.




	The Nominating and Governance Committee has concluded that each Director other than
	the Chairman of the Board is an independent director, and that it was satisfied that: (i) those independent Directors who have served for more than nine years continue to be independent in character and judgment; (ii) the
	experience of such Directors with the Fund permit them to make extremely valuable contributions to the functioning of the Board; and (iii) the views of such Directors are not entrenched as a result of the length of service to the
	Funds. The Nominating and Governance Committee based its conclusion, in part, on its observation that such Directors regularly demonstrate their independence by their questioning and challenging of management at and between Board meetings.




	The Nominating and Governance Committee also noted that none of the Directors serves on the board of more than three
	registered investment companies advised by the investment adviser, and that only one Director serves on the board of a large number of registered investment companies advised by an affiliate of the investment adviser. The Nominating and Governance
	Committee believes that such service provides the Director with insights that permit him to make valuable contributions to the deliberations of the Board, and noted that his independence from management has been amply and repeatedly demonstrated by
	his participation in meetings including by his insightful questioning of managements proposals. The Nominating and Governance Committee also believes that the receipt of compensation for service as a Director does not adversely affect the
	independence of any Directors character and judgment and notes that fund industry best practices encourage service on multiple boards.




	 




	16








	All members on each of the five committees of the Board are not interested
	persons as the term is defined in the Investment Company Act, with the exception of Mr. Strenger, who is a member of the Executive Committee.




	During the past fiscal year, the Board of Directors had four regular meetings. Each incumbent Director who served as a Director during the past fiscal year attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of
	meetings of the Board and meetings of Board Committees on which that Director served. The Board has a policy that encourages Directors to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, to the extent that travel to the Annual Meeting of Stockholders is
	reasonable for that Director. Two Directors attended the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.




	To communicate with the Board of
	Directors or an individual Director of the Fund, a stockholder must send a written communication to the Funds Secretary at One Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02108 (c/o The European Equity Fund, Inc.), addressed to (i) the Board of
	Directors of the Fund or an individual Director, and (ii) the Secretary of the Fund. The Secretary of the Fund will direct the correspondence to the appropriate parties.




	The Fund pays each of its Directors who is not an interested person of the Fund, of the investment adviser or of the administrator an annual fee of $6,000 plus $750 for each Board and Committee meeting
	attended. Each such Director who is also a Director of The New Germany Fund, Inc. or The Central Europe and Russia Fund, Inc. also receives the same annual and per-meeting fees for services as a Director of each such fund. Each of the Fund, The
	Central Europe and Russia Fund, Inc. and The New Germany Fund, Inc. reimburses the Directors (except for those employed by the Deutsche Bank Group) for travel expenses in connection with Board meetings. Effective January 1, 2011, the Chairman
	of the Audit Committee receives a $1,000 retainer. These three funds, together with 108 other open- and closed-end funds advised by wholly-owned entities of the Deutsche Bank Group in the United States, represent the entire Fund Complex
	within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.




	The following table sets forth (a) the aggregate
	compensation from the Fund for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and (b) the total compensation from each fund in the Fund Complex that includes the Fund, for the 2011 fiscal year of each such fund, (i) for each Director
	who is not an interested person of the Fund, and (ii) for all such Directors as a group:

	THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE

	FOR

	PROPOSALS 1 AND 2.






	Required Vote.

	    Provided a quorum has been established, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
	entitled to be cast at the Meeting is required for the election of each Director. For purposes of the election of Directors, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against a Director.








	PROPOSAL 3:






	RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS





	The Audit
	Committee has approved PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the Firm or PwC), an independent registered public accounting firm, as independent auditors for the Fund for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012. A majority of
	members of the Board of Directors, including a majority of the members of the Board of Directors who are not interested Directors (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the Fund, have ratified the appointment of PwC as the
	Funds independent auditors for that fiscal year. Based principally on representations from the Firm, the Fund knows of no direct financial or material indirect financial interest of such Firm in the Fund. That Firm, or a predecessor firm, has
	served as the independent auditors for the Fund since inception.




	Neither our Charter nor Bylaws require that the stockholders
	ratify the appointment of PwC as our independent auditors. We are doing so because we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors will
	reconsider whether or not to retain PwC, but may retain such independent auditors. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors in their discretion may change the appointment at any time during the year if they
	determine that such change would be in the best interests of the Fund and its stockholders. It is intended that the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy will vote for PwC. A representative of PwC will be present at the Meeting and will
	have the opportunity to make a statement and is expected to be available to answer appropriate questions concerning the Funds financial statements.





	THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE

	FOR

	PROPOSAL 3.






	Required Vote.

	    Provided a quorum has been established, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast
	at the Meeting is required for the ratification of the appointment by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of PwC as independent auditors for the Fund for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012. For purposes of Proposal 3,
	abstentions will have no effect on the result of the vote.

	The following table shows fees paid to PwC by the Fund during the Funds two most recent fiscal years: (i) for audit and non-audit services provided to the Fund, and (ii) for engagements
	for non-audit services pre-approved by the Audit Committee for the Funds investment adviser and administrator and certain entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser and administrator that provide
	ongoing services to the Fund (collectively, the Adviser Entities), which engagements relate directly to the




	 




	18








	operations and financial reporting of the Fund. The Audit Committee of each board will review, at least annually, whether PwCs receipt of non-audit fees from the Fund, the Funds
	investment adviser, the Funds administrator and all Adviser Entities is compatible with maintaining PwCs independence.

	Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures.

	    Generally, the
	Audit Committee must pre-approve (i) all services to be performed for the Fund by the Funds independent auditors and (ii) all non-audit services to be performed by the Funds independent auditors for the Funds investment
	adviser or any Adviser Entities with respect to operations and financial reporting of the Fund. Any member of the Audit Committee may pre-approve any audit or non-audit services to be performed by the independent auditors, provided that any such
	approvals are presented to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The auditors shall report to the Audit Committee at each of its regular meetings all audit or non-audit services to the Fund and all non-audit services to the Adviser
	Entities that relate directly to the Funds operations and financial reporting initiated since the last such report was rendered, including a general description of the services and projected fees and the means by which such services were
	approved by the Audit Committee.





	All Non-Audit Fees.

	    The table below shows the aggregate
	non-audit fees billed by PwC for services rendered to the Fund and to the Adviser Entities that provide ongoing services to the Fund, whether or not such engagements relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund, for the two
	most recent fiscal years for the Fund.

	PwC advised the Funds Audit Committee that it had identified one matter that it determined could be
	inconsistent with the SECs auditor independence rules (Rule 2-01(c) of Regulation S-X). As part of a Global Migration Support engagement in which PwCs UK network affiliate (PwC-UK) provided assistance to Deutsche
	Bank AG with respect to processing internship applications for Deutsche Bank AG employees seeking short term assignments with Deutsche Bank AG in the United Kingdom, PwC-UK paid application fees on behalf of Deutsche Bank AG for six applicants at
	£170 each (£1,020 in total). PwC advised the Audit Committee that it




	 




	19








	believes that this matter did not affect its objectivity or its impartial judgment in conducting its audit and issuing a report on the financial statements of the Fund as the Funds
	independent auditor and confirmed its independence under the SECs auditor independence rules. In reaching this conclusion, PwC noted that the engagement team was not aware of the payment of the application fees by PwC-UK and that DB reimbursed
	PwC-UK for the fees.

	UDIT

	OMMITTEE

	R

	EPORT






	The purposes of the Audit Committee are: (1) to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of (i) the integrity of the
	Funds financial statements; (ii) the Funds compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (iii) the independent auditors qualifications and independence; and (iv) the retention and performance of the independent
	auditors; and (2) to prepare this report. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in its oversight of the Funds policies and practices with respect to accounting, financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting,
	independent audits, and risk management. The Audit Committee regularly discusses the Funds most significant risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. Each Member of the Audit Committee is
	independent, as required by the independence standards of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a written charter. As set forth in the Audit Committee Charter, management of
	the Fund and applicable service providers are responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Funds financial statements and for the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Management and applicable
	service providers are responsible for maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and internal control over financial reporting and other procedures that provide for compliance with accounting standards and
	applicable laws and regulations. The independent auditors are responsible for planning and carrying out a proper audit of the Funds annual financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting
	principles.




	In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has considered and discussed the audited
	financial statements with management and the independent auditors of the Fund. The Audit Committee has also discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61,

	Communication
	with Audit Committees

	, as currently in effect. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of any non-audit services not pre-approved by the Audit Committee provided by the Funds independent auditors to the Funds
	investment adviser, administrator or to any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Funds investment adviser or administrator that provides ongoing services to the Fund is compatible with maintaining the
	auditors independence. During the past fiscal year, no non-audit services that were not pre-approved by the Audit Committee were provided by the Funds independent auditors. Finally, the Audit Committee has received the written
	disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, as currently in effect, and has discussed with the auditors their
	independence.




	The members of the Audit Committee are not full-time employees of the Fund and are not performing the functions
	of auditors or accountants. As such, it is not the duty or responsibility of the Audit Committee or its members to conduct field work or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures or to set auditor independence
	standards. Members of the Audit Committee necessarily rely on the information provided to them by management and the




	 




	20








	independent auditors. Accordingly, the Audit Committees considerations and discussions referred to above do not assure that the audit of the Funds financial statements has been
	carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or that the Funds auditors are in fact independent.




	Based upon the reports and discussions described in this report, and subject to the limitations on the role and
	responsibilities of the Audit Committee referred to above and in the Charter, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors of the Fund that the audited financial statements of the Fund be included in the Funds annual report to
	stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.

	Based on a review of reports filed by the Funds directors and executive officers, the investment adviser, officers and directors of the investment adviser, affiliated persons of the investment
	adviser and beneficial holders of 10% or more of the Funds outstanding stock, and written representations by the Reporting Persons that no year-end reports were required for such persons, all filings required by Section 16(a) of the
	Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 were timely.








	OTHER MATTERS





	No business other than as set forth herein is expected to come before the Meeting, but should any other matter requiring a
	vote of stockholders properly come before the Meeting, including any question as to an adjournment of the Meeting, the persons named in the enclosed Proxy Card will vote thereon according to their discretion. Abstentions and broker non-votes shall
	have no effect on the outcome of a vote to adjourn the Meeting.








	STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS





	In order for stockholder proposals otherwise satisfying the eligibility requirements of SEC Rule 14a-8 to be considered for inclusion
	in the Funds proxy statement for the 2013 Annual Meeting, the proposals must be received at The European Equity Fund, Inc., c/o Deutsche Investment Management Americas, One Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02108, Attention: Secretary, on or
	before January 21, 2013.




	In addition, the Funds Bylaws currently provide that if a stockholder desires to bring
	business (including director nominations) before the 2013 Annual Meeting that is or is not the subject of a proposal timely submitted for inclusion in the Funds proxy statement, written notice of such business as prescribed in the Bylaws must
	be delivered to the Funds Secretary, at the principal executive offices of the Fund, between January 21, 2013 and February 20, 2013. For additional requirements, the stockholder may refer to the Bylaws, a current copy of which may be
	obtained without charge upon request from the Funds Secretary. If the Fund does not receive timely notice pursuant to the Bylaws, the proposal may be excluded from consideration at the meeting, regardless of any earlier notice provided in
	accordance with SEC Rule 14a-8.





	PROXY COSTS AND SOLICITATION OF PROXIES





	The cost of preparing, assembling and mailing material in connection with this solicitation will be borne by the Fund. In addition to the
	use of mails, proxies may be solicited personally by regular employees of the Fund or the administrator or by telephone, telegraph or Internet. Brokerage houses, banks and other fiduciaries may be requested to forward proxy solicitation materials to
	their principals to obtain authorization for the execution of proxies, and they will be reimbursed by the Fund for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in this connection. The Fund has also made arrangements with AST to assist in the solicitation of
	proxies, if called upon by the Fund, at an estimated fee of $6,500 plus reimbursement of normal expenses (the exact cost will depend on the amount and types of services rendered). If the stockholders record votes by




	 




	22








	telephone or through the Internet, the proxy solicitor will use procedures designed to authenticate stockholders identities, to allow stockholders to authorize the voting of their shares in
	accordance with their instructions and to allow stockholders to confirm that their instructions have been recorded properly.




	If a stockholder wishes to participate in the Meeting, but does not wish to give a proxy by telephone or via the Internet, the stockholder
	may still submit the Proxy Card(s) originally sent with this Proxy Statement or attend the Meeting in person. Should stockholders require additional information regarding the proxy or replacement Proxy Card(s), they may call AST toll-free at
	1-800-774-4195. Any proxy given by a stockholder is revocable until voted at the Meeting.




	As the Meeting date approaches,
	certain stockholders of the Funds may receive a telephone call from a representative of AST if their votes have not yet been received.




	One Proxy Statement may be delivered to two or more stockholders of the Fund who share an address, unless the Fund has received instructions to the contrary. To request a separate copy of the Proxy
	Statement, which will be delivered upon written or oral request, or for instructions as to how to request a single copy if multiple copies are received, stockholders should call 800-349-4281 or write to the Fund at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New
	York 10154.








	ANNUAL REPORT DELIVERY

	    (1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an
	annual meeting of stockholders (i) pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record both at the
	time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 13(a) and at the time of the annual meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 13(a).




	(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii)
	of paragraph (a)(1) of this Section 13, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for action by the stockholders. To be timely,
	a stockholders notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice for the
	preceding years annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of mailing of the notice for the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice
	for the preceding years annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of mailing of the notice for such annual meeting and not later than the close of business
	on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of mailing of the notice for such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which disclosure of the date of mailing of the notice for such meeting is first made. In no event shall the
	public announcement of a postponement or adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. Such stockholders notice shall set forth (i) as to each person whom the
	stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director, (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the class and number of shares of stock of the Corporation that are beneficially owned
	by such person, (C) all other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or is otherwise
	required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A (or any successor provision) under the Exchange Act or pursuant to the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder (including such persons written consent to being named in the proxy
	statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected), and (D) a statement specifying which of clauses (1)-(7) of the definition of Relevant Experience and Country Knowledge in Article III, Section 3 of the
	Bylaws the person being nominated satisfies, information relating to such person sufficient to support a determination that the person satisfies the specified clause or clauses of the definition and a representation that the person does not have a
	Conflict of Interest as defined in Article III, Section 3 of the Bylaws; (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a description of the business desired to be brought before
	the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business




	 




	A-1








	at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder (including any anticipated benefit to the stockholder therefrom) and of each beneficial owner, if any, on whose
	behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and each beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (x) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the
	Corporations stock ledgers and a current name and address, if different, and of such beneficial owner, and (y) the class and number of shares of each class of stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such
	stockholder and owned beneficially by such beneficial owner.




	(3) Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (a) of
	this Section 13 to the contrary, in the event the Board of Directors increases or decreases the maximum or minimum number of directors in accordance with Article III, Section 2 of these Bylaws, and there is no public announcement of
	such action at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of mailing of the preceding years annual meeting, a stockholders notice required by this Section 13(a) shall also be considered timely, but only with
	respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such
	public announcement is first made by the Corporation.




	(b) 


	Special Meetings of
	Stockholders

	.

	    Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for
	election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (i) pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or
	(iii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such special meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record both at the time of giving of notice provided for in this
	Section 13 and at the time of the special meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 13. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for
	the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election as a director as specified in the Corporations notice of meeting, if the
	stockholders notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 13 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later
	than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of
	Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of a postponement or adjournment of a special meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.




	(c) 


	General

	.

	    (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set
	forth in this Section 13 and Article III, Section 3 of these Bylaws shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in
	accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 13. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case
	may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 13 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 13, to declare that such defective nomination or proposal be disregarded.




	 




	A-2








	(2) For purposes of this Section 13, (a) the date of mailing of the
	notice shall mean the date of the proxy statement for the solicitation of proxies for election of directors and (b) public announcement shall mean disclosure (i) in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
	Associated Press or comparable news service or (ii) in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Investment Company Act.




	(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable
	requirements of state law and of the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 13. Nothing in this Section 13 shall be deemed to affect any
	right of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in, nor the right of the Corporation to omit a proposal from, the Corporations proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the Exchange Act.




	Article III




	S

	ECTION

	 3.    


	Qualifications

	.

	    Directors need not be
	stockholders. Each Director shall hold office until the earlier of: (a) the expiration of his term and his or her successor shall have been elected and qualifies, (b) his or her death, (c) his or her resignation, or (d) his or
	her removal. To be eligible for nomination as a director a person must, at the time of such persons nomination, (a) have Relevant Experience and Country Knowledge (as defined below), (b) not have any Conflict of Interest (as defined

	Additional Information







	The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation primarily
	through investment in European equities.



	Investments in funds
	involve risks, including the loss of principal.






	The shares of most closed-end
	funds, including the Fund, are not continuously offered. Once issued, shares of closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open
	market. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the Fund's shares is determined
	by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund cannot predict whether its shares
	will trade at, below or above net asset value.






	This Fund is diversified
	and primarily focuses its investments in equity securities of issuers domiciled in countries that are members of the European Union,
	thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in that region. Investing in foreign securities presents certain risks, such
	as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. Any fund that concentrates in a particular segment
	of the market will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly.






	The European Union, the
	United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia as a result of the Russian military intervention in Ukraine.
	These sanctions have adversely affected Russian individuals, issuers and the Russian economy, and Russia, in turn, has imposed
	sanctions targeting Western individuals, businesses and products including food products. The various sanctions have adversely
	affected, and may continue to adversely affect, not only the Russian economy but also the economies of many countries in Europe.
	Potential developments in Ukraine, and the continuation of current sanctions or the imposition of additional sanctions may materially
	adversely affect the value of the Fund’s portfolio.






	Deutsche Asset Management
	represents the asset management activities conducted by Deutsche Bank AG or any of its subsidiaries.

	Letter
	to the Shareholders




	(Unaudited)






	Dear Shareholder,


	For the year 2015, the European Equity Fund, Inc.'s
	total return in U.S. dollars (USD) was –1.65% based on net asset value and –0.03% based on market price. During the
	same period, the total return of the Fund's benchmark, the MSCI Europe Index, was –2.84%.

	1

	The Fund's discount
	to net asset value averaged 10.60% for the year 2015, compared with 10.31% for the year 2014.


	European stock markets had a positive year in local
	currency terms. In euro terms, the MSCI Europe Index had a total return of 8.2% and the Fund's net asset value had a 9.3% return.
	The euro depreciated by over 10% versus the U.S. dollar.


	Lead economic indicators improved in Europe throughout
	the year. PMIs and the German IFO index advanced further, with the Eurozone PMI reaching a new high for the year at 54.3 and the
	IFO at 109.

	2,3

	Consumer confidence was also up for the Eurozone as a whole. The spillover from low oil prices had a
	delayed positive effect on consumption. Eurozone gross domestic product (GDP) gradually moved away from the zero-growth line, reaching
	+1.5% towards year-end, with Germany and Spain delivering the highest growth while France improved in the second half of the year.
	Finally, overall credit development continues to improve.


	The two key regions for European exporters, North America
	and China, showed diverging trends in 2015. In terms of growth, China was a key driver over the last few years, but showed a considerable
	slowdown this year. The surprising devaluation of their currency, the renminbi, versus the U.S. dollar in August caused a considerable
	correction of Chinese equity markets with repercussions for equity markets worldwide. Conversely, the U.S. economy stayed on a
	steady GDP growth path of between +2% and +3%, despite the negative effect of low oil prices on the energy and cyclical industrial
	sectors.


	Global liquidity conditions and the monetary policy
	of the European Central Bank provided a supportive framework for equities: quantitative easing was announced in February, and in
	December 2015 was extended until March 2017. The much anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) interest rate hike of 0.25%
	in December 2015 played only a minor role for global equity markets, as the Fed stressed that further tightening would be gradual.


	Bottom-up support for the markets came from two fronts.
	Q3 earnings came in better than had been feared after the cyclical meltdown of that quarter. Industrials, energy and materials
	largely disappointed, but consumer staples, health care and technology showed above-average positive surprises. Sector performance
	diverged strongly, with energy and materials suffering double-digit losses (–13% and –11%, respectively), while three
	sectors had double-digit gains: consumer staples +17%, technology +14% and health care +13%, respectively. Besides earnings, brisk
	merger and acquisition activity was supportive. Overall for 2015, European markets delivered another successful year for equities.


	In terms of performance, the portfolio again outperformed
	its benchmark, driven by a significantly positive contribution from stock selection. Many of our quality growth stocks, such as
	Chr. Hansen A/S, GrandVision, Lonza Group Ltd., Societe BIC and Partners Group Holding, performed very well. The allocation contribution
	was negative due to our temporary market hedge and cash holdings. However, this again lowered the volatility of the portfolio,
	an important goal of our more defensive Stability strategy.


	The portfolio positioning of maintaining a stable core
	of quality growth stocks worked well. We added some more cyclical value stocks when a cyclical recovery looked likely in Q1 and
	after the summer's market correction in Q4. When adding such riskier stocks, we look for growth that to a high degree is dependent
	on a company's own efforts and not on factors beyond management's control. The financial sector weight of the portfolio increased
	as a result of adding stocks in domestic retail banking (Lloyds) and private equity (Partners Group).


	In addition, we generally hedge equity market risk
	whenever the portfolio of equities has above-average market risk, and our short-term market outlook is negative. The goal is to
	reduce potential losses and deliver more stable returns. On average in 2015, the hedges reduced the Fund's return, but also reduced
	the volatility of returns.

	Economic Outlook




	While further large gains from equities globally seem
	more challenging in 2016, there are a number of factors supporting European equities. On the macro side, early indicators are continuing
	to improve for most European economies, and the windfall for consumers from lower oil prices is even larger after the latest drop.
	Unlike the U.S., monetary policy in the European Union (EU) is still in expansionary mode with an increasing quantitative easing
	program.


	There exist a number of potential risks, such as further
	deterioration of China's economy and political risks including further Middle East conflicts, the continuation of the refugee crisis
	and an impasse in EU reforms. Similarly to the U.S., Europe continues to face some unsolved structural issues. There is only a
	slow political path to solve the growing liabilities of social welfare in the face of negative demographics in most European countries.
	Levels of indebtedness continue to be excessive. A good portion of these negative factors seem discounted by the pessimistic sentiment
	of investors at the start of 2016. With investors' cash balances high and rates near zero, the pressure to invest into equities
	is high and dividend yields exceed corporate bond yields.


	From the bottom-up view, profit margins are still below
	long-term historical levels. We may see a catch-up effect to the U.S., where margins are at their peaks. In addition, valuations
	in Europe are not excessive and considerably lower than in the U.S. Finally, we believe the market will continue to be supported
	by merger and acquisition activity and cash return to shareholders through both dividends and buybacks.


	Sincerely,

	Outlook
	Interview with the





	Portfolio Manager




	(Unaudited)








	Portfolio Manager




	Gerd Kirsten




	Question:



	Can you specify how large the valuation gap of European equities is to the U.S.?





	Answer:



	Using the MSCI Europe Index for Europe and the Standard & Poor's 500

	®

	(S&P 500) Index for the U.S., the
	advantage on a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is 14.2 vs. 15.7; the current dividend yield is 3.8% vs. 2.3%; the current
	price-to-book ratio is 1.5 vs. 2.6; and the current enterprise value-sales ratio is 1.4 to 2.1 (Source: Bloomberg, as of January
	12, 2016).

	1,2,3

	This equals an average 31% discount of European equities.





	Question:



	What sectors and companies will benefit from the drop in oil prices?





	Answer:



	The foremost beneficiaries are companies with products that depend on consumer discretionary spending. Here the range is wide,
	from telecommunications companies selling higher-priced subscriptions (e.g., Telefonica Deutschland), retailers selling affordable
	luxury (e.g., Dufry), airlines with strongly expanding margins (e.g., EasyJet), to bigger-ticket items such as automobiles
	(e.g., Daimler). Companies with large costs in oil as a raw material, such as industrials and chemicals, need to be judged
	carefully. In many cases, there is a passthrough to the price of end products.





	Question:



	What type of structural growth do you find in Europe?





	Answer:



	This is very company-specific and fortunately there are many stocks to choose from. Due to demographics and rising living standards,
	health care continues on a solid growth path. For example, we own a key supplier of niche chemicals for drugs (Lonza Group Ltd.,
	Switzerland) and the world's largest manufacturer of lenses for eyewear (Essilor International, France). The consumer staples sector
	also offers some growth niches. Chr. Hansen A/S, Denmark, is one of only two global suppliers of cultures for cheese and yoghurt
	as well as all-natural flavors. Another example is Société BIC, France, which sells affordable quality shavers, pens
	and lighters all over the world. Management has a track record of penetrating more and more countries, irrespective of the so-called
	emerging market crisis.

	in the above Schedule of Investments consist of multiple industry sub-groups or industries.







	Fair Value Measurements







	Various inputs are used
	in determining the value of the Fund’s investments. These inputs are summarized in three broad levels. Level 1 includes quoted
	prices in active markets for identical securities. Level 2 includes other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
	for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk). Level 3 includes significant unobservable inputs (including
	the Fund’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments). The level assigned to the securities valuations
	may not be an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.





	The following is a summary of the inputs used as of
	December 31, 2015 in valuing the Fund’s investments.

	Notes to Financial Statements





	A. Accounting Policies




	The European Equity Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
	was incorporated in Delaware on April 8, 1986 as a diversified, closed-end management investment company. Investment operations
	commenced on July 23, 1986. The Fund reincorporated in Maryland on August 29, 1990 and, on October 16, 1996, the Fund changed from
	a diversified to a non-diversified company. The Fund became a diversified fund on October 31, 2008.


	The preparation of financial statements in accordance
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.




	Security Valuation.



	The Fund calculates its net asset value ("NAV") per share for publication at the close of regular trading on XETRA, normally
	11:30 a.m., New York time.



	Various inputs are used in determining the value of
	the Fund's investments. These inputs are summarized in three broad levels. Level 1 includes quoted prices in active markets for
	identical securities. Level 2 includes other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest
	rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk). Level 3 includes significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions
	in determining the fair value of investments). The level assigned to the securities valuations may not be an indication of the
	risk or liquidity associated with investing in those securities.


	Equity securities are valued at the most recent sale
	price or official closing price reported on the exchange (U.S. or foreign) or over-the-counter market on which they trade prior
	to the time of valuation. Securities for which no sales are reported are valued at the calculated mean between the most recent
	bid and asked quotations on the relevant market or, if a mean cannot be determined, at the most recent bid quotation. Equity securities
	are generally categorized as Level 1.


	Investments in open-end investment companies are valued
	at their NAV each business day and are categorized as Level 1.


	Purchased options are generally valued at the settlement
	prices established each day on the exchange on which they are traded and are categorized as Level 1.


	Futures contracts are generally valued at the settlement
	prices established each day on the exchange on which they are traded and are categorized as Level 1.


	Securities and other assets for which market quotations
	are not readily available or for which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value are valued in a manner
	that is intended to reflect their fair value as determined in accordance with procedures approved by the Board and are generally
	categorized as Level 3. In accordance with the Fund's valuation procedures, factors considered in determining value may include,
	but are not limited to, the type of the security; the size of the holding; the initial cost of the security; the existence of any
	contractual restrictions on the security's disposition; the price and extent of public trading in similar securities of the issuer
	or of comparable companies; quotations or evaluated prices from broker-dealers and/or the appropriate stock exchange (for exchange-traded
	securities); an analysis of the company's or issuer's financial statements; an evaluation of the forces that influence the issuer
	and the market(s) in which the security is purchased and sold; and, with respect to debt securities, the maturity, coupon, creditworthiness,
	currency denomination and the movement of the market in which the security is normally traded. The value determined under these
	procedures may differ from published values for the same securities.


	Disclosure about the classification of the fair value
	measurements is included in a table following the Fund's Schedule of Investments.




	Securities Transactions
	and Investment Income.



	Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade date plus
	one basis for daily NAV calculation. However, for financial reporting purposes, investment security transactions are reported on
	trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date net of foreign
	withholding taxes. Certain dividends from foreign securities may be recorded subsequent to the ex-dividend date as soon as the
	Fund is informed of such dividends. Realized gains and losses from investment transactions are recorded on an identified cost basis.
	Proceeds from litigation payments, if any, are included in net realized gain (loss) for investments.





	Securities Lending.



	Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., as lending agent, lends securities of the Fund to certain financial institutions under the terms
	of the Security Lending Agreement. The Fund retains the benefit of owning the securities it has loaned and continues to receive
	interest and dividends generated by the securities and to participate in any changes in their market value. The Fund requires the
	borrowers of the securities to maintain collateral with the Fund consisting of either cash or liquid, unencumbered assets having
	a value at least equal to the value of the securities loaned. When the collateral falls below specified amounts, the lending agent
	will use its best effort to obtain additional collateral on the next business day to meet required amounts under the security lending
	agreement. The Fund may invest the cash collateral into a joint trading account in an affiliated money market fund pursuant to
	Exemptive Orders issued by the SEC. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Fund invested the cash collateral in Daily Assets
	Fund, an affiliated money market fund managed by Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. Deutsche Investment Management Americas
	Inc. receives a management/administration fee (0.08% annualized effective rate as of December 31, 2015) on the cash collateral
	invested in Daily Assets Fund. The Fund receives compensation for lending its securities either in the form of fees or by earning
	interest on invested cash collateral net of borrower rebates and fees paid to a lending agent. Either the Fund or the borrower
	may terminate the loan. There may be risks of delay and costs in recovery of securities or even loss of rights in the collateral
	should the borrower of the securities fail financially. If the Fund is not able to recover securities lent, the Fund may sell the
	collateral and purchase a replacement investment in the market, incurring the risk that the value of the replacement security is
	greater than the value of the collateral. The Fund is also subject to all investment risks associated with the reinvestment of
	any cash collateral received, including, but not limited to, interest rate, credit and liquidity risk associated with such investments.



	The Fund had no securities on loan at December 31,
	2015.




	Foreign Currency Translation.



	The books and records of the Fund are maintained in United States dollars.



	Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency
	are translated into United States dollars at the prevailing exchange rates at period end. Purchases and sales of investment securities,
	income and expenses are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. Net realized
	and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent net gains and losses between trade and settlement dates
	on securities transactions, the acquisition and disposition of foreign currencies, and the difference between the amount of net
	investment income accrued and the U.S. dollar amount actually received. The portion of both realized and unrealized gains and losses
	on investments that results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed but is included with
	net realized and unrealized gain/appreciation and loss/depreciation on investments.


	At December 31, 2015, the exchange rate was EUR €1.00
	to USD $1.09.




	Contingencies.



	In the normal course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts with service providers that contain general indemnification
	clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against
	the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.





	Taxes.



	The Fund's policy is to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, which are applicable to regulated
	investment companies, and to distribute all of its taxable income to its shareholders.



	Additionally, the Fund may be subject to taxes imposed
	by the governments of countries in which it invests and are generally based on income and/or capital gains earned or repatriated.
	Estimated tax liabilities on certain foreign securities are recorded on an accrual basis and are reflected as components of interest
	income or net change in unrealized gain/loss on investments. Tax liabilities realized as a result of security sales are reflected
	as a component of net realized gain/loss on investments.


	Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization
	Act of 2010, net capital losses incurred post-enactment may be carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as
	short-term and/or long-term. Previously, net capital losses were carried forward for eight years and treated as short-term losses.
	As a transition rule, the Act requires that post-enactment net capital losses be used before pre-enactment net capital losses.


	At December 31, 2015, the Fund had a net tax basis
	capital loss carryforward of approximately $19,102,000 of pre-enactment losses, which may be applied against any realized net taxable
	capital gains of each succeeding year until fully utilized or until December 31, 2017 (the expiration date), whichever occurs first.


	In addition, from November 1, 2015 through December
	31, 2015, the Fund elects to defer qualified late year losses of approximately $2,968,000 of net short-term realized capital losses
	and treat them as arising in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.


	The Fund has reviewed the tax positions for the open
	tax years as of December 31, 2015 and has determined that no provision for income tax and/or uncertain tax provisions is required
	in the Fund's financial statements. The Fund's federal tax returns for the prior three fiscal years remain open subject to examinations
	by the Internal Revenue Service.




	Dividends and Distributions
	to Shareholders



	The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders on the
	ex-dividend date. The timing and character of certain income and capital gain distributions are determined annually in accordance
	with United States federal income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America. These differences primarily relate to investments in foreign currency denominated investments, recognition of
	certain foreign currency gains (losses) as ordinary income (loss) and certain securities sold at a loss. As a result, net investment
	income (loss) and net realized gain (loss) on investment transactions for a reporting period may differ significantly from distributions
	during such period. Accordingly, the Fund may periodically make reclassifications among certain of its capital accounts without
	impacting the NAV of the Fund.



	At December 31, 2015, the Fund's components of distributable
	earnings (accumulated losses) on a tax basis were as follows:







	Undistributed ordinary income






	$ 163,016








	Capital loss carryforwards






	$ (22,070,000)








	Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)






	$ 2,125,837








	In addition, the tax character of distributions paid
	to shareholders by the Fund is summarized as follows:




	 




	Years Ended December 31,








	 




	2015








	2014









	Distributions from ordinary income*






	$ 1,467,412






	$ 1,051,114








	* For tax purposes, short-term
	capital gain is considered ordinary income.







	Futures Contracts.



	A futures contract is an agreement between a buyer or seller and an established futures exchange or its clearinghouse in which
	the buyer or seller agrees to take or make a delivery of a specific amount of a financial instrument at a specified price on a
	specific date (settlement date). For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Fund used futures contracts for hedging purposes, for
	risk management and as a substitute for direct investment in a particular asset class.



	Upon entering into a futures contract, the Fund is
	required to deposit with a financial intermediary cash or securities ("initial margin") in an amount equal to a certain
	percentage of the face value indicated in the futures contract. Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made or
	received by the Fund dependent upon the daily fluctuations in the value and are recorded for financial reporting purposes as unrealized
	gains or losses by the Fund. Gains or losses are realized when the contract expires or is closed. Since all futures contracts are
	exchange traded, counterparty risk is minimized as the exchange's clearinghouse acts as the counterparty, and guarantees the futures
	against default.


	Certain risks may arise upon entering into futures
	contracts, including the risk that an illiquid market will limit the Fund's ability to close out a futures contract prior to the
	settlement date and the risk that the futures contract is not well correlated with the security, index or currency in which it
	relates. Risk of loss may exceed amounts disclosed in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.


	There were no open futures contracts as of December
	31, 2015. For the period ended December 31, 2015, the investment in futures contracts purchased had a notional value indicative
	of a range from $0 to approximately $9,169,000.




	Options.



	An option contract is a contract in which the writer (seller) of the option grants the buyer of the option, upon payment of a premium,
	the right to purchase from (call option), or sell to (put option), the writer a designated instrument at a specified price within
	a specified period of time. Certain options, including options on indices and interest rate options, will require cash settlement
	by the Fund if exercised. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Fund entered into options for hedging purposes.



	If the Fund writes a covered call option, the Fund
	foregoes, in exchange for the premium, the opportunity to profit during the option period from an increase in the market value
	of the underlying security above the exercise price. If the Fund writes a put option it accepts the risk of a decline in the value
	of the underlying security below the exercise price. Over-the-counter options have the risk of the potential inability of counterparties
	to meet the terms of their contracts. The Fund's maximum exposure to purchased options is limited to the premium initially paid.
	In addition, certain risks may arise upon entering into option contracts, including the risk that an illiquid secondary market
	will limit the Fund's ability to close out an option contract prior to the expiration date and that a change in the value of the
	option contract may not correlate exactly with changes in the value of the securities hedged.


	There were no open option contracts as of December
	31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the investment in purchased option contracts had a total value indicative of a
	range from $0 to approximately $934,000.


	The following table summarizes the amount of realized
	gains and losses on derivative instruments recognized in the Fund's earnings during the year ended December 31, 2015, and the related
	location in the accompanying Statement of Operations is summarized in the following table by primary underlying risk exposure:

	B. Investment Advisory
	and Administration Agreements




	The Fund is party to an Investment Advisory Agreement
	with Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management International GmbH ("DeAWMI"). The Fund also has an Administration Agreement
	with Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. ("DIMA"). DeAWMI and DIMA are affiliated companies.


	Under the Investment Advisory Agreement with DeAWMI,
	DeAWMI directs the investments of the Fund in accordance with its investment objectives, policies and restrictions. DeAWMI determines
	the securities, instruments and other contracts relating to investments to be purchased, sold or entered into by the Fund.


	The Investment Advisory Agreement provides DeAWMI with
	a fee, computed weekly and payable monthly, at the annual rate of 0.80% of the Fund's average weekly net assets up to and including
	$50 million, 0.70% of such assets in excess of $50 million and up to and including $100 million, and 0.60% of such assets in excess
	of $100 million.


	Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2015,
	the fee pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement was equivalent to an annual rate of 0.76% of the Fund's average daily net
	assets.


	Under the Administration Agreement with DIMA, DIMA
	provides all of the non-investment advisory services to the Fund. The Administration Agreement provides DIMA with a fee, computed
	weekly and payable monthly, of 0.20% of the Fund's average weekly net assets.




	C. Transactions with
	Affiliates




	DeAWM Service Company ("DSC"), an affiliate
	of DIMA, is the transfer agent, dividend-paying agent and shareholder service agent of the Fund. Pursuant to a sub-transfer agency
	agreement between DSC and DST Systems, Inc. ("DST"), DSC has delegated certain transfer agent and dividend-paying agent
	paying functions to DST. DSC compensates DST out of the shareholder servicing fee it receives from the Fund. For the year ended
	December 31, 2015, the amount charged to the Fund by DSC aggregated $19,772, of which $1,658 is unpaid.


	Under an agreement with DIMA, DIMA is compensated for
	providing typesetting and certain regulatory filing services to the Fund. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the amount charged
	to the Fund by DIMA included in the Statements of Operations under "Reports to shareholders" aggregated $18,389, of which
	$6,139 is unpaid.


	Deutsche Bank AG, the German parent of DIMA and DeAWMI,
	and its affiliates may receive brokerage commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio securities on behalf
	of the Fund, that the Board determined were effected in compliance with the Fund's Rule 17e-1 procedures. For the year ended December
	31, 2015, Deutsche Bank did not receive brokerage commissions.


	Certain Officers of the Fund are also officers of DIMA
	or DeAWMI.


	The Fund pays each Director who is not an "interested
	person" of DIMA or DeAWMI retainer fees plus specified amounts for attended board and committee meetings.


	The Fund may invest cash balances in Central Cash Management
	Fund, which is managed by DIMA. The Fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of the expenses of Central Cash Management Fund.
	Central Cash Management Fund does not pay DIMA an investment management fee. Central Cash Management Fund seeks a high level of
	current income consistent with liquidity and the preservation of capital.




	D. Portfolio Securities




	Purchases and sales of investment securities, excluding
	short-term investments, for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $74,100,670 and $79,673,575, respectively.




	E. Capital




	During the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year
	ended December 31, 2014, the Fund purchased 131,473 and 495,067 of its shares of common stock on the open market at a total
	cost of $1,102,656 and $4,317,420 ($8.39 and $8.72 average per share), respectively. The average discount of these purchased shares
	comparing the purchased price to the NAV at the time of purchase was 10.37% and 9.88%, respectively.


	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Fund accepted
	459,529 tendered shares of common stock on the open market at a total cost of $4,351,740 at a repurchase price of $9.47 per share,
	which was equal to 98% of the NAV per share on February 23, 2015.


	During the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year
	ended December 31, 2014, the Fund issued for dividend reinvestment 31,616 and 33,043 shares, respectively. The average discount
	of these issued shares comparing the issue price to the NAV at the time of issuance was 9.94% and 9.95%, respectively.




	F. Share Repurchases
	and Tender Offers




	On July 26, 2013, the Fund announced that the Board
	of Directors approved an extension of the repurchase authorization permitting the Fund to repurchase 550,000 shares during the
	period from August 1, 2013 through July 31, 2014. The Fund repurchased 460,147 shares between August 1, 2013 and July 31, 2014.
	On July 28, 2014, the Fund announced that the Board of Directors approved an extension of the repurchase authorization permitting
	the Fund to repurchase up to 950,000 shares during the period from August 1, 2014 through July 31, 2015. The Fund repurchased 260,755
	shares between August 1, 2014 and July 31, 2015. On July 27, 2015, the Fund announced that the Board of Directors approved an extension
	of the current repurchase authorization permitting the Fund to repurchase up to 874,000 shares during the period from August 1,
	2015 through July 31, 2016. The Fund repurchased 79,011 shares between August 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015.


	Repurchases will be made from time to time when they
	are believed to be in the best interests of the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund's repurchases will reduce the spread
	between the market price of the Fund's shares referred to below and its NAV per share.


	Monthly updates concerning the Fund's repurchase program
	are available on its Web site at deutschefunds.com.


	On January 31, 2012, the Fund announced that the Board
	of Directors approved a new Discount Management Program (the "New Program") on the same terms as the Fund's then current
	program. Pursuant to the New Program, the Fund's Board of Directors approved a new series of up to four consecutive semiannual
	tender offers, each for up to 5% of the Fund's outstanding shares at a price equal to 98% of NAV per share. The Fund would conduct
	a tender offer if its shares traded at an average discount to NAV of more than 10% during the 12-week measurement period. During
	the fourth measurement period that commenced on April 7, 2014 and expired on June 27, 2014, the Fund's shares traded at an average
	discount to NAV of less than 10%. Therefore, the Fund was not required to conduct a tender offer.


	On July 28, 2014, the Fund announced that the Board
	of Directors adopted a new Discount Management Program whereby the Fund would initiate one contingent tender offer during the period
	from August 1, 2014 through July 31, 2015 for up to 5% of the Fund's shares outstanding at 98% of the Fund's NAV per share. The
	terms of the Discount Management Program required the Fund to conduct a tender offer if its shares traded at an average discount
	to NAV of more than 10% during a 15-week measurement period determined by the Board of Directors. During the measurement period
	that commenced on September 2, 2014 and expired on December 12, 2014, the Fund's shares traded at an average discount to NAV of
	10.93%. Therefore, the Fund conducted a tender offer which commenced on January 22, 2015 and expired on February 20, 2015. The
	Fund accepted 459,529 shares (which represent 5% of the Fund's outstanding shares of common stock) at a price equal to 98% of the
	NAV per share as of the close of the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange on February 23, 2015. Approximately
	4,372,566 shares of common stock, or approximately 47.58% of the Fund's common shares outstanding, were tendered through the expiration
	date. Because the offer was oversubscribed, not all of the tendered shares were accepted for payment by the Fund. Under the final
	pro-ration calculation, approximately 10.51% of the tendered shares were accepted for payment. The shares accepted for payment
	received cash as a repurchase price of $9.47 per share, which was equal to 98% of the NAV per share on February 23, 2015.




	G. Concentration of
	Ownership




	From time to time, the Fund may have a concentration
	of several shareholder accounts holding a significant percentage of shares outstanding. Investment activities of these shareholders
	could have a material impact on the Fund. At December 31, 2015, there were three shareholders that held approximately 15%, 8% and
	6%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of the Fund.

	and Shareholders of The European Equity Fund, Inc.






	In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets
	and liabilities, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of changes in net assets and
	the financial highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The European Equity Fund, Inc. (the
	"Fund") at December 31, 2015, the results of its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights
	for each of the periods indicated therein, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
	responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
	audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
	Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
	whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
	by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
	of securities at December 31, 2015 by correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	Voluntary
	Cash Purchase Program and Dividend Reinvestment Plan




	(Unaudited)






	The Fund offers shareholders a Voluntary Cash Purchase
	Program and Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") which provides for optional cash purchases and for the automatic reinvestment
	of dividends and distributions payable by the Fund in additional Fund shares. A more complete description of the Plan is provided
	in the Plan brochure available from DeAWM Service Company, the transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent"), P.O. Box 219066,
	Kansas City, Missouri 64105 (telephone 1-800-349-4281). DST Systems, Inc. (the "Plan Agent") acts as the plan agent under
	the Plan. A shareholder should read the Plan brochure carefully before enrolling in the Plan.


	Under the Plan, participating shareholders ("Plan
	Participants") appoint the Transfer Agent to receive or invest Fund distributions as described below under "Reinvestment
	of Fund Shares." In addition, Plan Participants may make optional cash purchases through the Transfer Agent as often as once
	a month as described below under "Voluntary Cash Purchases." There is no charge to Plan Participants for participating
	in the Plan, although when shares are purchased under the Plan by the Plan Agent on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on
	the open market, each Plan Participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred in connection with such purchases,
	as described below under "Reinvestment of Fund Shares" and "Voluntary Cash Purchases."




	Reinvestment of Fund
	Shares.



	Whenever the Fund declares a capital gain distribution, an income dividend or
	a return of capital distribution payable, at the election of shareholders, either in cash or in Fund shares, or payable only in
	cash, the Transfer Agent shall automatically elect to receive Fund shares for the account of each Plan Participant.



	Whenever the Fund declares a capital gain distribution,
	an income dividend or a return of capital distribution payable only in cash and the net asset value per share of the Fund's common
	stock equals or is less than the market price per share on the valuation date (the "Market Parity or Premium"), the Transfer
	Agent shall apply the amount of such dividend or distribution payable to a Plan Participant to the purchase from the Fund of Fund
	Shares for a Plan Participant's account, except that if the Fund does not offer shares for such purpose because it concludes Securities
	Act registration would be required and such registration cannot be timely effected or is not otherwise a cost-effective alternative
	for the Fund, then the Transfer Agent shall follow the procedure described in the next paragraph. The number of additional shares
	to be credited to a Plan Participant's account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the distribution payable to
	a Plan Participant by the net asset value per share of the Fund's common stock on the valuation date, or if the net asset value
	per share is less than 95% of the market price per share on such date, then by 95% of the market price per share. The valuation
	date will be the payable date for such dividend or distribution.


	Whenever the Fund declares a capital gains distribution,
	an income dividend or a return of capital distribution payable only in cash and the net asset value per share of the Fund's common
	stock exceeds the market price per share on the valuation date (the "Market Discount"), the Plan Agent shall apply the
	amount of such dividend or distribution payable to a Plan Participant (less a Plan Participant's pro rata share of brokerage commissions
	incurred with respect to open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such dividend or distribution) to the purchase
	on the open market of Fund shares for a Plan Participant's account. The valuation date will be the payable date for such dividend
	or distribution. Such purchases will be made on or shortly after the valuation date and in no event more than 30 days after such
	date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of federal
	securities laws.


	The Transfer Agent or the Plan Agent may aggregate
	a Plan Participant's purchases with the purchases of other Plan Participants, and the average price (including brokerage commissions)
	of all shares purchased by the Plan Agent shall be the price per share allocable to each Plan Participant.


	For all purposes of the Plan, the market price of the
	Fund's common stock on a payable date shall be the last sales price on the New York Stock Exchange on that date, or, if there is
	no sale on such Exchange (or, if different, the principal exchange for Fund shares) on that date, then the mean between the closing
	bid and asked quotations for such stock on such Exchange on such date. The net asset value per share of the Fund's common stock
	on a valuation date shall be as determined by or on behalf of the Fund.


	The Transfer Agent may hold a Plan Participant's shares
	acquired pursuant to the Plan, together with the shares of other Plan Participants acquired pursuant to this Plan, in non-certificated
	form in the name of the Transfer Agent or that of a nominee. The Transfer Agent will forward to each Plan Participant any proxy
	solicitation material and will vote any shares so held for a Plan Participant only in accordance with the proxy returned by a Plan
	Participant to the Fund. Upon a Plan Participant's written request, the Transfer Agent will deliver to a Plan Participant, without
	charge, a certificate or certificates for the full shares held by the Transfer Agent.




	Voluntary Cash Purchases.



	Plan Participants have the option of making investments in Fund shares through the Transfer Agent as often as once a month. Plan
	Participants may invest as little as $100 in any month and may invest up to $36,000 annually through the voluntary cash purchase
	feature of the Plan.



	The Plan Agent shall apply such funds (less a Plan
	Participant's pro rata share of brokerage commissions or other costs, if any) to the purchase on the New York Stock Exchange (or,
	if different, on the principal exchange for Fund shares) or otherwise on the open market of Fund shares for such Plan Participant's
	account, regardless of whether there is a Market Parity or Premium or a Market Discount. The Plan Agent will purchase shares for
	Plan Participants on or about the 15th of each month. Cash payments received by the Transfer Agent less than five business days
	prior to a cash purchase investment date will be held by the Transfer Agent until the next month's investment date. Uninvested
	funds will not bear interest. Plan Participants may withdraw any voluntary cash payment by written notice received by the Transfer
	Agent not less than 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.




	Enrollment and Withdrawal.



	Both current shareholders and first-time investors in the Fund are eligible to participate in the Plan. Current shareholders may
	join the Plan by either enrolling their shares with the Transfer Agent or by making an initial cash deposit of at least $250 with
	the Transfer Agent. First-time investors in the Fund may join the Plan by making an initial cash deposit of at least $250 with
	the Transfer Agent. In order to become a Plan Participant, shareholders must complete and sign the enrollment form included in
	the Plan brochure and return it, and, if applicable, an initial cash deposit of at least $250 directly to the Transfer Agent if
	shares are registered in their name. Shareholders who hold Fund shares in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee should
	contact such nominee to arrange for it to participate in the Plan on such shareholder's behalf.



	If the Plan Participant elects to participate in the
	Plan by enrolling current shares owned by the Plan Participant with the Transfer Agent, participation in the dividend reinvestment
	feature of the Plan begins with the next dividend or capital gains distribution payable after the Transfer Agent receives the Plan
	Participant's written authorization, provided such authorization is received by the Transfer Agent prior to the record date for
	such dividend or distribution. If such authorization is received after such record date, the Plan Participant's participation in
	the dividend reinvestment feature of the Plan begins with the following dividend or distribution.


	If the Plan Participant elects to participate in the
	Plan by making an initial cash deposit of at least $250 with the Transfer Agent, participation in the dividend reinvestment feature
	of the Plan begins with the next dividend or capital gains distribution payable after the Transfer Agent receives the Plan Participant's
	authorization and deposit, and after the Plan Agent purchases shares for the Plan Participant on the New York Stock Exchange (or,
	if different, on the principal exchange for Fund shares) or otherwise on the open market, provided that the authorization and deposit
	are received, and the purchases are made by the Plan Agent prior to the record date. If such authorization and deposit are received
	after the record date, or if the Plan Agent purchases shares for the Plan Participant after the record date, the Plan Participant's
	participation in the dividend reinvestment feature of the Plan begins with the following dividend or distribution.


	A shareholder's written authorization and cash payment
	must be received by the Transfer Agent at least five business days in advance of the next cash purchase investment date (normally
	the 15th of every month) in order for the Plan Participant to participate in the voluntary cash purchase feature of the Plan in
	that month.


	Plan Participants may withdraw from the Plan without
	charge by written notice to the Transfer Agent. Plan Participants who choose to withdraw may elect to receive stock certificates
	representing all of the full shares held by the Transfer Agent on their behalf, or to instruct the Transfer Agent to sell such
	full shares and distribute the proceeds, net of brokerage commissions, to such withdrawing Plan Participant. Withdrawing Plan Participants
	will receive a cash adjustment for the market value of any fractional shares held on their behalf at the time of termination. Withdrawal
	will be effective immediately with respect to distributions with a record date not less than 10 days later than receipt of such
	written notice by the Transfer Agent.




	Amendment and Termination
	of Plan.



	The Plan may only be amended or supplemented by the Fund or by the Transfer Agent
	by giving each Plan Participant written notice at least 90 days prior to the effective date of such amendment or supplement, except
	that such notice period may be shortened when necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable law or the rules or policies
	of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory body.



	The Plan may be terminated by the Fund or by the Transfer
	Agent by written notice mailed to each Plan Participant. Such termination will be effective with respect to all distributions with
	a record date at least 90 days after the mailing of such written notice to the Plan Participants.




	Federal Income Tax
	Implications of Reinvestment of Fund Shares.



	Reinvestment of Fund shares does not relieve
	Plan Participants from any income tax which may be payable on dividends or distributions. For U.S. federal income tax purposes,
	when the Fund issues shares representing an income dividend or a capital gains dividend, a Participant will include in income the
	fair market value of the shares received as of the payment date, which will be ordinary dividend income or capital gains, as the
	case may be. The shares will have a tax basis equal to such fair market value, and the holding period for the shares will begin
	on the day after the date of distribution. If shares are purchased on the open market by the Plan Agent, a Plan Participant will
	include in income the amount of the cash payment made. The basis of such shares will be the purchase price of the shares, and the
	holding period for the shares will begin on the day following the date of purchase. State, local and foreign taxes may also be
	applicable.





	Approval
	of Continuance of Investment Advisory Agreement




	(Unaudited)






	The Fund’s directors unanimously approved the
	continuance of the investment advisory agreement between the Fund and Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management International GmbH
	("DeAWMI") (the "agreement") at a meeting held on October 23, 2015. The Fund’s directors simultaneously
	approved the continuance of the administration agreement (the "administration agreement") between the Fund and Deutsche
	Investment Management Americas Inc. ("DIMA"), an affiliate of DeAWMI.


	In preparation for the meeting, the directors had requested,
	received and evaluated extensive materials from DeAWMI, including performance and expense information for other investment companies
	with similar investment objectives derived from data compiled by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper"). Prior to voting, the directors
	reviewed the proposed approval of the continuance of the agreement with management and with experienced Fund counsel and received
	a memorandum from such counsel discussing the legal standards for their consideration of the proposed approval of the continuance.
	The directors also discussed the proposed approval in a private session with counsel at which no representatives of DeAWMI or DIMA
	were present. In reaching their determination relating to approval of the agreement, the directors considered all factors they
	believed relevant, including the following:


	1. information comparing the Fund’s performance
	to other investment companies with similar investment objectives and to an index;


	2. the nature, extent and quality of investment advisory
	and other services rendered by DeAWMI;


	3. payments received by DeAWMI and its affiliates (including
	DIMA) from all sources in respect to the Fund and all investment companies in the Deutsche family of funds;


	4. the costs borne by, and profitability of, DeAWMI
	and DIMA in providing services to the Fund;


	5. comparative fee and expense data for the Fund and
	other investment companies with similar investment objectives;


	6. the extent to which economies of scale would be
	realized as the Fund grows and whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of investors;


	7. DeAWMI’s policies and practices regarding
	allocation of the Fund’s portfolio transactions, including the extent to which DeAWMI benefits from soft dollar arrangements;


	8. the Fund’s portfolio turnover rates compared
	to those of other closed-end investment companies investing in international equities;


	9. fall-out benefits which DeAWMI and its affiliates
	receive from their relationships with the Fund;


	10. information concerning the programs established
	by DeAWMI with respect to compliance, risk management, disclosure and ethics;


	11. the professional experience and qualifications
	of the Fund’s portfolio management team and other senior personnel of DeAWMI; the implications for DeAWMI and DIMA of the
	management reorganization of Deutsche Bank AG announced on October 18, 2015 and management’s representation that such reorganization
	was not expected to have any adverse effect on the management or operations of the Fund or on the identities of persons at DeAWMI
	and DIMA providing services to the Fund; and DeAWMI’s strengthening of the investment resources supporting the Fund in 2009;
	and


	12. the terms of the agreement.


	The directors also considered their knowledge of the
	nature and quality of the services provided by DIMA and DeAWMI to the Fund gained from their experience as directors of the New
	Germany Fund and the Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund and, where relevant, other Deutsche funds, their confidence in DeAWMI’s
	integrity and competence gained from that experience and DeAWMI’s responsiveness to concerns raised by them in the past,
	including DeAWMI’s willingness to consider and implement organizational and operational changes designed to improve investment
	results and the services provided to the Fund.


	In their deliberations, the directors did not identify
	any particular information that was all-important or controlling, and each director attributed different weights to the various
	factors.


	The directors determined that the overall arrangements
	between the Fund and DeAWMI, as provided in the agreement, were fair and reasonable in light of the services performed, expenses
	incurred and such other matters as the directors considered relevant in the exercise of their reasonable judgment. The directors
	further determined that they were satisfied that the services provided by DeAWMI to the Fund represented good value for the money
	payable to it by the Fund.


	The material factors and conclusions that formed the
	basis for the directors’ reaching their determination to approve the continuance of the agreement (including their determinations
	that DeAWMI should continue in its role as investment advisor for the Fund, and that the fees payable to DeAWMI pursuant to the
	agreement are appropriate) were separately discussed by the directors.




	Nature, Extent and
	Quality of Services Provided by DeAWMI.



	The directors noted that, under the agreement,
	DeAWMI, in accordance with the Fund’s investment objectives, policies and limitations, makes all decisions with respect to
	suitable securities for investment by the Fund and transmits purchase and sale orders and selects brokers and dealers to execute
	portfolio transactions on behalf of the Fund. DeAWMI pays all of the compensation of the Fund’s directors and officers who
	are interested persons of DeAWMI.



	The directors considered the scope and quality of services
	provided by DeAWMI under the agreement and noted that the scope of services provided had expanded over time as a result of regulatory
	and other developments. The directors also considered the commitment of DeAWMI to, and the programs established by it with respect
	to, compliance, risk management, disclosure and ethics. The directors considered the quality of the investment research capabilities
	of DeAWMI and the other resources it has dedicated to performing services for the Fund. The quality of the advisory services provided
	also were considered. The directors concluded that, overall, they were satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of services
	provided (and expected to be provided) to the Fund under the agreement.




	Costs of Services
	Provided and Profitability to DeAWMI.









	At
	the request of the directors, DeAWMI provided information concerning: its revenues, expenses, net income and financial condition
	for 2014; and information about revenues and expenses and the profitability of its relationship with the Fund in 2014. Similar
	information was provided for DIMA. The directors reviewed the assumptions and methods of allocation used by DeAWMI and DIMA in
	preparing Fund specific profitability data. DeAWMI and DIMA stated their belief that the methods of allocation used were reasonable,
	but noted that there are limitations inherent in allocating costs to multiple individual clients served by organizations such as
	DIMA and DeAWMI where each of the clients draws on, and benefits from, the research and other resources of the Deutsche Bank organization.



	The directors recognized that it is difficult to make
	comparisons of profitability from fund advisory contracts because comparative information is not generally publicly available and
	is affected by numerous factors, including the structure of the particular advisor, the types of funds it manages, its business
	mix, numerous assumptions regarding allocations and the advisor’s capital structure and cost of capital. In considering profitability
	information, the directors considered the effect of possible fall-out benefits on DeAWMI’s expenses, including the fact that
	there were no affiliated brokerage commissions.


	The directors noted that DeAWMI may allocate brokerage
	to receive research generated by, or paid for by, executing brokers. They also noted that DeAWMI has policies to prohibit consideration
	of the sale of shares of Deutsche funds when selecting broker dealers to execute portfolio transactions for the Fund or other Deutsche
	funds.


	The directors recognized that DeAWMI should, as a general
	matter, be entitled to earn a reasonable level of profits for the services it provides to the Fund and, based on their review,
	concluded that DeAWMI’s level of profitability from its relationships with the Fund was not excessive. The directors also
	considered the aggregate profitability of the relationships with the Fund of DeAWMI and DIMA and concluded that it was not excessive.




	Investment Results.



	In addition to the information received by the directors for the meeting, the directors receive detailed performance information
	for the Fund at each regular board meeting during the year and also receive monthly performance information. As the Fund is not
	aware of any closed-end fund with an objective similar to that of the Fund, the directors generally focus on the Fund’s performance
	based on net asset value compared to its benchmark when assessing investment results. The directors also reviewed information showing
	the Fund’s performance compared to that of other investment vehicles compiled by management based on information provided
	by Lipper and Morningstar (a total of 32 funds, consisting of exchange-traded funds and open-end funds). The directors also reviewed
	information showing performance of the Fund’s benchmark index, which, from November 1, 2005 (when the Fund changed its investment
	focus from Germany to the European countries utilizing the Euro currency), through June 30, 2014 was the MSCI EMU index, an unmanaged
	capitalization-weighted index comprising several hundred companies domiciled in the countries using the Euro currency, and prior
	thereto was the Germany DAX index of 30 large cap stocks. Effective July 1, 2014 the Fund’s benchmark index is the MSCI
	Europe Index, reflecting a broadening of the Fund’s investment objective approved by stockholders at the Fund’s annual
	meeting of stockholders on June 19, 2014.



	The comparative information showed that the Fund outperformed
	its benchmark in the first nine months of 2015 and in 2014 and underperformed it in 2013. The Fund matched the performance of the
	benchmark in 2012, outperformed the benchmark in 2011, 2010 and 2009, and underperformed the benchmark from 2004 through 2008.
	Taking into account these comparisons and the other factors considered, including DeAWMI’s strengthening of the investment
	resources supporting the Fund in 2009, the directors concluded that the Fund’s investment results since the changes implemented
	in 2009 were satisfactory.




	Management and Investment
	Advisory Fees and Other Expenses.



	The directors considered the investment advisory fee
	rates payable by the Fund to DeAWMI under the agreement. The directors recognized that it is difficult to make comparisons of advisory
	fees because there are variations in the services that are included in the fees paid by other funds. The directors also considered
	information provided by DeAWMI concerning the fee rates charged to other investment companies having somewhat similar mandates
	as the Fund, as well as the representation by DeAWMI that it does not manage any other institutional accounts that are similar
	to the Fund, and its review of the reasons that it does not consider institutional fee rates to be relevant to the consideration
	of appropriate fee rates payable by investment companies such as the Fund. The directors noted that the management fee paid by
	a U.S. open-end fund advised by DeAWMI was somewhat lower that the current effective combined advisory and administrative fee for
	the Fund, while non-U.S. open-end funds advised by DeAWMI pay management fees that, while not entirely comparable to the fees payable
	by the Fund to DeAWMI and DIMA, are substantially higher than the combined advisory and administration fee rate paid by the Fund.



	The Fund’s management expense comparison group
	consisted of six closed-end developed market funds (including the Fund) and 11 open-end European region funds (plus the Fund) selected
	by Lipper. The directors reviewed information comparing the combined advisory and administrative fees payable under the agreement
	and the administration agreement for this purpose, noting that DeAWMI and DIMA are affiliated companies. The directors noted that
	the combined advisory and administrative fee rate paid by the Fund in 2014 of 0.956% was above the average and median fee rates
	of both comparison groups, but that the assets of the Fund were very significantly below the average and median asset levels of
	such groups, and that at asset levels of $100 million the Fund’s effective fee rate would be below the median and the average
	for the closed-end group and above the median and average for the open-end group. The directors noted that the Fund’s effective
	fee rate reflects the effect of breakpoints. The directors also considered the Fund’s total expense ratio in comparison to
	the fees and expenses of 60 closed-end international equity funds compiled by management based on Morningstar data. The directors
	also noted that the Fund’s expense ratio was above the median and the average and in the third quartile of the comparison
	group. Management explained that this was principally the result of the Fund’s relatively small asset base and reviewed steps
	that had been and were being implemented as part of continuing efforts to reduce expenses. The directors concluded that the Fund’s
	expense ratio was satisfactory.




	Economies of Scale.



	The directors noted that the investment advisory fee schedule in the agreement contains
	breakpoints that reduce the fee rate on assets above specified levels. The directors recognized that breakpoints may be an appropriate
	way for DeAWMI to share its economies of scale with some funds that have substantial assets or that may grow materially over the
	next year. However, they also recognized that there is no direct relationship between the economies of scale realized by funds
	and those realized by DeAWMI as assets increase, largely because economies of scale are realized (if at all) by DeAWMI across a
	variety of products and services, and not only in respect of a single fund. They also noted that the Fund’s assets have diminished
	in recent years. Having taken these factors into account, the directors concluded that the breakpoint arrangements in the agreement
	were acceptable under the Fund’s circumstances.

	Amended
	and Restated Bylaws




	(Unaudited)






	On May 1, 2015, the Fund announced that the Board had
	approved amended and restated bylaws of the Fund. The amended and restated bylaws reflect a number of changes, including changes
	to: (1) the period of time during which a stockholder's notice of director nominations or proposals of other business to be brought
	before an annual meeting of the Fund's stockholders must be submitted to the secretary of the Fund in order to be "timely";
	(2) the requirements for provision of information by a stockholder with respect to stockholder proposals for nominations or other
	business to be considered at a stockholder meeting, and to the procedures for the verification and updating of such information
	by such stockholder upon the written request of the Secretary or Board of the Fund; and (3) the Fund's director qualification provisions.
	In addition, the amended and restated bylaws add an exclusive forum provision for certain actions against the Fund and its Directors,
	officers or employees (specifying that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction,
	the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division, would be the sole and exclusive forum for such
	actions).

	There are three closed-end funds investing in European
	equities advised and administered by wholly owned subsidiaries of the Deutsche Bank Group:





	—


	The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. — investing primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of issuers domiciled
	in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey (with normally at least 80% in securities of issuers in such countries).




	—


	The European Equity Fund, Inc. — investing primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of companies domiciled in countries
	that are members of the European Union (with normally at least 80% in securities of issuers in such countries).




	—


	The New Germany Fund, Inc. — investing primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of middle market German companies
	with up to 20% in other Western European companies (with no more than 15% in any single country).


	Please consult your broker for advice on any of the
	above or call 1-800-349-4281 (in the U.S.) or 00-800-2287-2750 (outside of the U.S.) for shareholder reports.


	The European Equity Fund, Inc. is diversified and primarily
	focuses its investments in equity securities of issuers domiciled in countries that are members of the European Union, thereby
	increasing its vulnerability to developments in that region. Investing in foreign securities presents certain risks, such as currency
	fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. Any fund that concentrates in a particular segment of the market
	will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly.

	CODE OF ETHICS






	 


	 




	 



	As of the end of the period covered by this report, the registrant
	has adopted a code of ethics, as defined in Item 2 of Form N-CSR, that applies to its Principal Executive Officer and Principal
	Financial Officer.


	 


	There have been no amendments to, or waivers from, a provision of
	the code of ethics during the period covered by this report that would require disclosure under Item 2.


	 


	A copy of the code of ethics is filed as an exhibit to this Form
	N-CSR.






	 


	 








	ITEM 3.






	AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT






	 


	 









	 



	The Fund’s Board of Directors has determined that the
	Fund has at least one “audit committee financial expert” serving on its audit committee: Mr. Richard Karl
	Goeltz and Mr. Joachim Wagner. Each of these audit committee members is “independent,” meaning that he is not an
	“interested person” of the Fund (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of
	1940) and he does not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the Fund (except in the capacity as a
	Board or committee member).


	 


	An “audit committee financial expert” is not an “expert”
	for any purpose, including for purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as a result of being designated as an “audit
	committee financial expert.” Further, the designation of a person as an “audit committee financial expert” does
	not mean that the person has any greater duties, obligations, or liability than those imposed on the person without the “audit
	committee financial expert” designation. Similarly, the designation of a person as an “audit committee financial expert”
	does not affect the duties, obligations, or liability of any other member of the audit committee or board of directors.

	Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. Generally, each Fund’s
	Audit Committee must pre approve (i) all services to be performed for a Fund by a Fund’s Independent Registered Public Accounting
	Firm and (ii) all non-audit services to be performed by a Fund’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the Advisor
	Entities with respect to operations and financial reporting of the Fund. The Audit Committee may, in its discretion, delegate all
	or a portion of its duties and responsibilities to a subcommittee of the Audit Committee. The Board and the Audit Committee have
	authorized any member of the Audit Committee to pre-approve any audit or non-audit services to be performed by the independent
	auditors, provided that any such approvals are presented to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.


	 


	There were no amounts that were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant
	to the de minimis exception under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.


	 


	According to the registrant’s principal Independent Registered Public
	Accounting Firm, substantially all of the principal Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm's hours spent on auditing the
	registrant's financial statements were attributed to work performed by full-time permanent employees of the principal Independent
	Registered Public Accounting Firm.


	 


	***


	In connection with the audit
	of the 2014 and 2015 financial statements, the Fund entered into an engagement letter with PwC. The terms of the 2015 engagement
	letter required by PwC, and agreed to by the Fund’s Audit Committee, include a provision mandating the use of mediation and
	arbitration to resolve any controversy or claim between the parties arising out of or relating to the engagement letter or the

	Proxy Voting Policy and Guidelines




	 






	1.






	Introduction






	Deutsche Asset Management (“AM”)
	has adopted and implemented the following Policies and Guidelines, which it believes are reasonably designed to ensure that proxies
	are voted in the best economic interest of clients and in accordance with its fiduciary duties and local regulation. This Proxy
	Voting Policy and Guidelines – AM (“Policy and Guidelines”) shall apply to all accounts managed by US domiciled
	advisers and to all US client accounts managed by non-US regional offices. Non-US regional offices are required to maintain procedures
	and to vote proxies as may be required by law on behalf of their non-US clients. In addition, AM’s proxy policies reflect
	the fiduciary standards and responsibilities for ERISA accounts.


	The attached guidelines represent a set of
	global recommendations that were determined by the Global Proxy Voting Sub-Committee (the “GPVSC”). These guidelines
	were developed to provide AM with a comprehensive list of recommendations that represent how AM will generally vote proxies for
	its clients. The recommendations derived from the application of these guidelines are not intended to influence the various AM
	legal entities either directly or indirectly by parent or affiliated companies. In addition, the organizational structures and
	documents of the various AM legal entities allows, where necessary or appropriate, the execution by individual AM subsidiaries
	of the proxy voting rights independently of any DB parent or affiliated company. This applies in particular to non-US fund management
	companies. The individuals that make proxy voting decisions are also free to act independently, subject to the normal and customary
	supervision by the Management/Boards of these AM legal entities.


	 






	2.






	AM’S Proxy Voting Responsibilities







	Proxy votes are
	the property of AM’s advisory clients.



	1



	As
	such, AM’s authority and responsibility to vote such proxies depend upon its contractual relationships with its clients or
	other delegated authority. AM has delegated responsibility for effecting its advisory clients’ proxy votes to Institutional
	Shareholder Services (“ISS”), an independent third-party proxy voting specialist. ISS votes AM’s advisory clients’
	proxies in accordance with AM’s proxy guidelines or AM’s specific instructions. Where a client has given specific instructions
	as to how a proxy should be voted, AM will notify ISS to carry out those instructions. Where no specific instruction exists, AM
	will follow the procedures in voting the proxies set forth in this document. Certain Taft-Hartley clients may direct AM to have
	ISS vote their proxies in accordance with Taft Hartley Voting Guidelines



	Clients may in certain instances contract with
	their custodial agent and notify AM that they wish to engage in securities lending transactions. In such cases, it is the responsibility
	of the custodian to deduct the number of shares that are on loan so that they do not get voted twice. To the extent a security
	is out on loan and AM determines that a proxy vote (or other shareholder action) is materially important to the client’s
	account, AM may request that the agent recall the security prior to the record date to allow AM to vote the securities.




	 




	 






	1





	For purposes of this document, “clients” refers to persons or entities: (i) for which AM serves as investment adviser or sub-adviser; (ii) for which AM votes proxies; and (iii) that have an economic or beneficial ownership interest in the portfolio securities of issuers soliciting such proxies.

	POLICIES








	3.1.






	Proxy Voting Activities are Conducted in the Best Economic Interest of Clients






	AM has adopted the following Policies and Guidelines to ensure that
	proxies are voted in accordance with the best economic interest of its clients, as determined by AM in good faith after appropriate
	review.


	 






	3.2.






	The Global Proxy Voting Sub-Committee






	The Global Proxy Voting Sub-Committee is an internal
	working group established by the applicable AM’s Investment Risk Oversight Committee pursuant to a written charter. The GPVSC
	is responsible for overseeing AM’s proxy voting activities, including:


	 





	•




	Adopting, monitoring and updating guidelines, attached as Attachment A (the “Guidelines”), that provide how AM will generally vote proxies pertaining to a comprehensive list of common proxy voting matters;






	•




	Voting proxies where (i) the issues are not covered by specific client instruction or the Guidelines; (ii) the Guidelines specify that the issues are to be determined on a case-by-case basis; or (iii) where an exception to the Guidelines may be in the best economic interest of AM’s clients; and






	•




	Monitoring Proxy Vendor Oversight’s proxy voting activities (see below).





	AM’s Proxy Vendor Oversight, a function
	of AM’s Operations Group, is responsible for coordinating with ISS to administer AM’s proxy voting process and for
	voting proxies in accordance with any specific client instructions or, if there are none, the Guidelines, and overseeing ISS’
	proxy responsibilities in this regard.


	 






	3.3






	Availability of Proxy Voting Policy and Guidelines and Proxy Voting Record






	Copies of this Policy, as it may be updated from
	time to time, is made available to clients as required by law and otherwise at AM’s discretion. Clients may also obtain information
	on how their proxies were voted by AM as required by law and otherwise at AM’s discretion. Note, however, that AM must not
	selectively disclose its investment company clients’ proxy voting records. Proxy Vendor Oversight will make proxy voting
	reports available to advisory clients upon request. The investment companies’ proxy voting records will be disclosed to shareholders
	by means of publicly-available annual filings of each company’s proxy voting record for the 12-month periods ending June
	30 (see Section 5, below), if so required by relevant law.


	 






	4.






	PROCEDURES






	The key aspects of AM’s proxy voting process are delineated
	below.


	 






	4.1.






	The GPVSC’s Proxy Voting Guidelines






	The Guidelines set forth the GPVSC’s standard
	voting positions on a comprehensive list of common proxy voting matters. The GPVSC has developed, and continues to update the Guidelines
	based on consideration of current corporate governance principles, industry standards, client feedback, and the impact of the matter
	on issuers and the value of the investments.


	The GPVSC will review the Guidelines as necessary
	to support the best economic interests of AM’s clients and, in any event, at least annually. The GPVSC will make changes
	to the Guidelines, whether as a result of the annual review or otherwise, taking solely into account the best economic interests
	of clients. Before changing the Guidelines, the GPVSC will thoroughly review and evaluate the proposed change and the reasons therefore,
	and the GPVSC Chair will ask GPVSC members whether anyone outside of the AM organization (but within Deutsche Bank and its affiliates)
	or any entity that identifies itself as an AM advisory client has requested or attempted to influence the proposed change and whether
	any member has a conflict of interest with respect to the proposed change. If any such matter is reported to the GPVSC Chair, the
	Chair will promptly notify the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee (see Section 4.4) and will defer the approval, if
	possible. Lastly, the GPVSC will fully document its rationale for approving any change to the Guidelines.


	The Guidelines may reflect a voting position
	that differs from the actual practices of the public company(ies) within the Deutsche Bank organization or of the investment companies
	for which AM or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or sponsor. Investment companies, particularly closed-end investment
	companies, are different from traditional operating companies. These differences may call for differences in voting positions on
	the same matter. Further, the


	manner in which AM votes investment company proxies
	may differ from proposals for which an AM-advised or sponsored investment company solicits proxies from its shareholders. As reflected
	in the Guidelines, proxies solicited by closed-end (and open-end) investment companies are generally voted in accordance with the
	pre-determined guidelines of ISS.


	Funds (“Underlying Funds”) in which
	Topiary Fund Management Fund of Funds (each, a “Fund”) invest, may from time to time seek to revise their investment
	terms (i.e. liquidity, fees, etc.) or investment structure. In such event, the Underlying Funds may require approval/consent from
	its investors to effect the relevant changes. Topiary Fund Management has adopted Proxy Voting Procedures which outline the process
	for these approvals.


	 






	4.2.






	Specific Proxy Voting Decisions Made by the GPVSC






	Proxy Vendor Oversight will refer to the GPVSC all proxy proposals
	(i) that are not covered by specific client instructions or the Guidelines; or (ii) that, according to the Guidelines, should be
	evaluated and voted on a case-by-case basis.



	Additionally,
	if Proxy Vendor Oversight, the GPVSC Chair or any member of the GPVSC, a Portfolio Manager, a Research Analyst or a sub-adviser
	believes that voting a particular proxy in accordance with the Guidelines may not be in the best economic interests of clients,
	that individual may bring the matter to the attention of the GPVSC Chair and/or Proxy Vendor Oversight.



	2




	If Proxy Vendor Oversight refers a proxy proposal
	to the GPVSC or the GPVSC determines that voting a particular proxy in accordance with the Guidelines is not in the best economic
	interests of clients, the GPVSC will evaluate and vote the proxy, subject to the procedures below regarding conflicts.


	The GPVSC endeavors to hold meetings to decide how to vote particular
	proxies sufficiently before the voting deadline so that the procedures below regarding conflicts can be completed before the GPVSC’s
	voting determination.




	 




	 






	2





	Proxy Vendor Oversight generally monitors upcoming proxy solicitations for heightened attention from the press or the industry and for novel or unusual proposals or circumstances, which may prompt Proxy Vendor Oversight to bring the solicitation to the attention of the GPVSC Chair. AM Portfolio Managers, AM Research Analysts and sub-advisers also may bring a particular proxy vote to the attention of the GPVSC Chair, as a result of their ongoing monitoring of portfolio securities held by advisory clients and/or their review of the periodic proxy voting record reports that the GPVSC Chair distributes to AM portfolio managers and AM research analysts.





	 


	 






	4.3.






	Certain Proxy Votes May Not Be Cast






	In some cases, the GPVSC may determine that it
	is in the best economic interests of its clients not to vote certain proxies, or that it may not be feasible to vote certain proxies.
	If the conditions below are met with regard to a proxy proposal, AM will abstain from voting:


	 





	•




	Neither the Guidelines nor specific client instructions cover an issue;






	•




	ISS does not make a recommendation on the issue; and






	•




	The GPVSC cannot convene on the proxy proposal at issue to make a determination as to what would be in the client’s best interest. (This could happen, for example, if the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee found that there was a material conflict or if despite all best efforts being made, the GPVSC quorum requirement could not be met).





	In addition, it is AM’s policy not to
	vote proxies of issuers subject to laws of those jurisdictions that impose restrictions upon selling shares after proxies are voted,
	in order to preserve liquidity. In other cases, it may not be possible to vote certain proxies, despite good faith efforts to do
	so. For example, some jurisdictions do not provide adequate notice to shareholders so that proxies may be voted on a timely basis.
	Voting rights on securities that have been loaned to third-parties transfer to those third-parties, with loan termination often
	being the only way to attempt to


	vote proxies on the loaned securities. Lastly, the GPVSC
	may determine that the costs to the client(s) associated with voting a particular proxy or group of proxies outweighs the economic
	benefits expected from voting the proxy or group of proxies.


	Proxy Vendor Oversight will coordinate with the GPVSC Chair regarding
	any specific proxies and any categories of proxies that will not or cannot be voted. The reasons for not voting any proxy shall
	be documented.


	 






	4.4.






	Conflict of Interest Procedures








	4.4.1.






	Procedures to Address Conflicts of Interest and Improper Influence








	Overriding Principle.

	In the limited
	circumstances where the GPVSC votes proxies



	3



	,
	the GPVSC will vote those proxies in accordance with what it, in good faith, determines to be the best economic interests of AM’s
	clients.



	4





	Independence of the GPVSC.

	As a matter
	of Compliance policy, the GPVSC and Proxy Vendor Oversight are structured to be independent from other parts of Deutsche Bank.
	Members of the GPVSC and the employee responsible for Proxy Vendor Oversight are employees of AM. As such, they may not be subject
	to the supervision or control of any employees of Deutsche Bank Corporate and Investment Banking division (“CIB”).
	Their compensation cannot be based upon their contribution to any business activity outside of AM without prior approval of Legal
	and Compliance. They can have no contact with employees of Deutsche Bank outside of the Private Client and Asset Management division
	(“PCAM”) regarding specific clients, business matters or initiatives without the prior approval of Legal and Compliance.
	They furthermore may not discuss proxy votes with any person outside of AM (and within AM only on a need to know basis).



	Conflict Review Procedures.

	The Conflicts
	of Interest Management Sub-Committee within AM monitors for potential material conflicts of interest in connection with proxy proposals
	that are to be evaluated by the GPVSC. Promptly upon a determination that a proxy vote shall be presented to the GPVSC, the GPVSC
	Chair shall notify the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee. The Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee shall
	promptly collect and review any information deemed reasonably appropriate to evaluate, in its reasonable judgment, if AM or any
	person participating in the proxy voting process has, or has the appearance of, a material conflict of interest. For the purposes
	of this policy, a conflict of interest shall be considered “material” to the extent that a reasonable person could
	expect the conflict to influence, or appear to influence, the GPVSC’s decision on the particular vote at issue. GPVSC should
	provide the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee a reasonable amount of time (no less than 24 hours) to perform all necessary
	and appropriate reviews. To the extent that a conflicts review cannot be sufficiently completed by the Conflicts of Interest Management
	Sub-Committee the proxies will be voted in accordance with the standard Guidelines.


	The information considered by the Conflicts
	of Interest Management Sub-Committee may include without limitation information regarding (i) AM client relationships; (ii) any
	relevant personal conflict known by the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee or brought to the attention of that sub-committee;
	and (iii) any communications with members of the GPVSC (or anyone participating or providing information to the GPVSC) and any
	person outside of the AM organization (but within Deutsche Bank and its affiliates) or any entity that identifies itself as an
	AM advisory client regarding the vote at issue. In the context of any determination, the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee
	may consult with and shall be entitled to rely upon all applicable outside experts, including legal counsel.


	Upon completion of the investigation, the Conflicts
	of Interest Management Sub-Committee will document its findings and conclusions. If the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee
	determines that (i) AM has a material conflict of interest that would prevent it from deciding how to vote the proxies concerned
	without further client consent; or (ii) certain individuals should be recused from participating in the proxy vote at issue, the
	Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee will so inform the GPVSC Chair.


	If notified that AM has a material conflict
	of interest as described above, the GPVSC chair will obtain instructions as to how the proxies should be voted either from (i)
	if time permits, the affected clients, or (ii) in accordance with the standard Guidelines. If notified that certain individuals
	should be recused from the proxy vote at issue, the GPVSC Chair shall do so in accordance with the procedures set forth below.




	 




	 






	3





	As mentioned above, the GPVSC votes proxies where: (i) neither a specific client instruction nor a Guideline directs how the proxy should be voted, (ii) where the Guidelines specify that an issue is to be determined on a case-by-case basis or (iii) where voting in accordance with the Guidelines may not be in the best economic interests of clients.







	4





	Proxy Vendor Oversight, who serves as the non-voting secretary of the GPVSC, may receive routine calls from proxy solicitors and other parties interested in a particular proxy vote. Any contact that attempts to exert improper pressure or influence shall be reported to the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee.





	Note: Any AM employee who becomes aware of
	a potential, material conflict of interest in respect of any proxy vote to be made on behalf of clients shall notify Compliance.
	Compliance shall call a meeting of the Conflict Review Committee to evaluate such conflict and determine a recommended course of
	action.



	Procedures to be followed by the GPVSC.

	At the beginning of any discussion regarding how to vote any proxy, the GPVSC Chair (or his or her delegate) will inquire as to
	whether any GPVSC member (whether voting or ex officio) or any person participating in the proxy voting process has a personal
	conflict of interest or has actual knowledge of an actual or apparent conflict that has not been reported to the Conflicts of Interest
	Management Sub-Committee.


	The GPVSC Chair also will inquire of these
	same parties whether they have actual knowledge regarding whether any Director, officer, or employee outside of the AM organization
	(but within Deutsche Bank and its affiliates) or any entity that identifies itself as an AM advisory client, has: (i) requested
	that AM, Proxy Vendor Oversight (or any member thereof) or a GPVSC member vote a particular proxy in a certain manner; (ii) attempted
	to influence AM, Proxy Vendor Oversight (or any member thereof), a GPVSC member or any other person in connection with proxy voting
	activities; or (iii) otherwise communicated with a GPVSC member, or any other person participating or providing information to
	the GPVSC regarding the particular proxy vote at issue, and which incident has not yet been reported to the Conflicts of Interest
	Management Sub-Committee.


	If any such incidents are reported to the GPVSC
	Chair, the Chair will promptly notify the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee and, if possible, will delay the vote
	until the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee can complete the conflicts report. If a delay is not possible, the Conflicts
	of Interest Management Sub-Committee will instruct the GPVSC (i) whether anyone should be recused from the proxy voting process
	or (ii) whether AM should vote the proxy in accordance with the standard guidelines, seek instructions as to how to vote the proxy
	at issue from ISS or, if time permits, the effected clients. These inquiries and discussions will be properly reflected in the
	GPVSC’s minutes.



	Duty to Report.

	Any AM employee, including
	any GPVSC member (whether voting or ex officio), that is aware of any actual or apparent conflict of interest relevant to, or any
	attempt by any person outside of the AM organization (but within Deutsche Bank and its affiliates) or any entity that identifies
	itself as an AM advisory client to influence, how AM votes its proxies has a duty to disclose the existence of the situation to
	the GPVSC Chair (or his or her designee) and the details of the matter to the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee. In
	the case of any person participating in the deliberations on a specific vote, such disclosure should be made before engaging in
	any activities or participating in any discussion pertaining to that vote.



	Recusal of Members.

	The GPVSC will recuse
	from participating in a specific proxy vote any GPVSC members (whether voting or ex officio) and/or any other person who (i) are
	personally involved in a material conflict of interest; or (ii) who, as determined by the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee,
	have actual knowledge of a circumstance or fact that could affect their independent judgment, in respect of such vote. The GPVSC
	will also exclude from consideration the views of any person (whether requested or volunteered) if the GPVSC or any member thereof
	knows, or if the Conflicts of Interest Management Sub-Committee has determined, that such other person has a material conflict
	of interest with respect to the particular proxy or has attempted to influence the vote in any manner prohibited by these policies.


	If, after excluding all relevant GPVSC voting
	members pursuant to the paragraph above, there are three or more GPVSC voting members remaining, those remaining GPVSC members
	will determine how to vote the proxy in accordance with these Policy and Guidelines. If there are fewer than three GPVSC voting
	members remaining, the GPVSC Chair will vote the proxy in accordance with the standard Guidelines or will obtain instructions as
	to how to have the proxy voted from, if time permits, the effected clients and otherwise from ISS.


	 






	4.4.2.






	Investment Companies and Affiliated Public Companies







	Investment Companies.

	As reflected in the
	Guidelines, all proxies solicited by open-end and closed-end investment companies are voted in accordance with the pre-determined
	guidelines of ISS, unless the investment company client directs AM to vote differently on a specific proxy or specific categories
	of proxies. However, regarding investment companies for which AM or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or principal underwriter,
	such proxies are voted in the same proportion as the vote of all other shareholders (i.e., “mirror” or “echo”
	voting). Master Fund proxies solicited from feeder Funds are voted in accordance with applicable provisions of Section 12 of the
	Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”).


	Subject to participation agreements with certain
	Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”) issuers that have received exemptive orders from the US Securities and Exchange Commission
	(“SEC”) allowing investing Deutsche funds to exceed the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Investment
	Company Act, AM will echo vote proxies for ETFs in which Deutsche Bank holds more than 25% of outstanding voting shares globally
	when required to do so by participation agreements and SEC orders.



	Affiliated Public Companies.

	For proxies
	solicited by non-investment company issuers of or within the Deutsche Bank organization, (e.g., Deutsche Bank itself), these proxies
	will be voted in the same proportion as the vote of other shareholders (i.e., “mirror” or “echo” voting).


	Note: With respect to the Central Cash Management
	Fund (registered under the Investment Company Act), the Fund is not required to engage in echo voting and the investment adviser
	will use these Guidelines and may determine, with respect to the Central Cash Management Fund, to vote contrary to the positions
	in the Guidelines, consistent with the Fund’s best interest.


	 






	4.4.3.






	Other Procedures that Limit Conflicts of Interest






	AM and other entities in the Deutsche Bank organization
	have adopted a number of policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to avoid various conflicts of interest, including
	those that may arise in connection with proxy voting, including but not limited to:


	 





	•




	Code of Business Conduct and Ethics - DB Group;






	•




	Conflicts of Interest Policy - DB Group;






	•




	Information Sharing Procedures – AWM, GTB & CB&S;






	•




	Code of Ethics – AWM; and






	•




	Code of Professional Conduct – US.





	The GPVSC expects that these policies, procedures and internal controls
	will greatly reduce the chance that the GPVSC (or, its members) would be involved in, aware of, or influenced by an actual or apparent
	conflict of interest.


	All impacted business units are required to
	adopt, implement, and maintain procedures to ensure compliance with this Section. At a minimum, such procedures must: (i) assign
	roles and responsibilities for carrying out the procedures, including responsibility for periodically updating the procedures;
	(ii) identify clear escalation paths for identified breaches of the procedures; and (iii) contain a legend or table mapping the
	procedures to this Section (e.g., cross-referencing Section or page numbers).


	 






	5.






	RECORDKEEPING






	At a minimum, the following records must be properly maintained
	and readily accessible in order to evidence compliance with this Policy.


	 





	•




	AM will maintain a record of each proxy vote cast by AM that includes among other things, company name, meeting date, proposals presented, vote cast and shares voted.






	•




	Proxy Vendor Oversight maintains records for each of the proxy ballots it votes. Specifically, the records include, but are not limited to:





	 


	 




	 



	−




	The proxy statement (and any additional solicitation materials) and relevant portions of annual statements.





	 



	−




	Any additional information considered in the voting process that may be obtained from an issuing company, its agents, or proxy research firms.





	 



	−




	Analyst worksheets created for stock option plan and share increase analyses; and





	 



	−




	Proxy Edge print-screen of actual vote election.





	 





	•




	AM will (i) retain this Policy and the Guidelines; (ii) will maintain records of client requests for proxy voting information; and (iii) will retain any documents Proxy Vendor Oversight or the GPVSC prepared that were material to making a voting decision or that memorialized the basis for a proxy voting decision.






	•




	The GPVSC also will create and maintain appropriate records documenting its compliance with this Policy, including records of its deliberations and decisions regarding conflicts of interest and their resolution.






	•




	With respect to AM’s investment company clients, ISS will create and maintain records of each company’s proxy voting record for the 12-month periods ending June 30. AM will compile the following information for each matter relating to a portfolio security considered at any shareholder meeting held during the period covered by the report and with respect to which the company was entitled to vote:







	 



	−




	The name of the issuer of the portfolio security;





	 



	−




	The exchange ticker symbol of the portfolio security (if symbol is available through reasonably practicable means);





	 



	−




	The Council on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (“CUSIP”) number for the portfolio security (if the number is available through reasonably practicable means);





	 



	−




	The shareholder meeting date;





	 



	−




	A brief identification of the matter voted on;





	 



	−




	Whether the matter was proposed by the issuer or by a security holder;





	 



	−




	Whether the company cast its vote on the matter;





	 



	−




	How the company cast its vote (e.g., for or against proposal, or abstain; for or withhold regarding election of Directors); and





	 



	−




	Whether the company cast its vote for or against Management.





	Note: This list is intended to provide guidance
	only in terms of the records that must be maintained in accordance with this policy. In addition, please note that records must
	be maintained in accordance with the Archiving and Record Retention Policy – Deutsche Bank Group and applicable policies
	and procedures thereunder.


	With respect to electronically stored records,
	“properly maintained” is defined as complete, authentic (unalterable), usable and backed-up. At a minimum, records
	should be retained for a period of not less than six years (or longer, if necessary to comply with applicable regulatory requirements),
	the first three years in an appropriate AM office.

	The GPVSC’S Oversight Role






	In addition to adopting the Guidelines and
	making proxy voting decisions on matters referred to it as set forth above, the GPVSC monitors the proxy voting process by reviewing
	summary proxy information presented by ISS. The GPVSC uses this review process to determine, among other things, whether any changes
	should be made to the Guidelines. This review will take place at least quarterly and is documented in the GPVSC’s minutes.

	International Proxy Voting





	These Guidelines may reflect a voting position
	that differs from the actual practices of the public company(ies) within the Deutsche Bank organization or of the investment companies
	for which AM or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or sponsor.



	NOTE

	: Because of the unique structure
	and regulatory scheme applicable to closed-end investment companies, the voting guidelines (particularly those related to governance
	issues) generally will be inapplicable to holdings of closed-end investment companies. As a result, determinations on the appropriate
	voting recommendation for closed-end investment company shares will be made on a case-by-case basis.


	 








	I.






	Board of Directors and Executives








	A.






	Election of Directors







	Routine:

	AM Policy is to vote “for”
	the uncontested election of Directors. Votes for a Director in an uncontested election will be withheld in cases where a Director
	has shown an inability to perform his/her duties in the best interests of the shareholders.



	Proxy contest:

	In a proxy contest involving
	election of Directors, a case-by-case voting decision will be made based upon analysis of the issues involved and the merits of
	the incumbent and dissident slates of Directors. AM will incorporate the decisions of a third party proxy research vendor, currently,
	Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”) subject to review by the Proxy Voting Sub-Committee (“GPVSC”)
	as set forth in the AM’s Proxy Voting Policy and Guidelines.




	Rationale

	:

	The large majority
	of corporate Directors fulfill their fiduciary obligation and in most cases support for Management’s nominees is warranted.
	As the issues relevant to a contested election differ in each instance, those cases must be addressed as they arise.


	 






	B.






	Classified Boards of Directors






	AM policy is to vote against proposals to classify the Board and for
	proposals to repeal classified Boards and elect Directors annually.



	Rationale

	: Directors should be held accountable on an annual
	basis. By entrenching the incumbent Board, a classified Board may be used as an anti-takeover device to the detriment of the shareholders
	in a hostile take-over situation.


	 






	C.






	Board and Committee Independence






	AM policy is to vote:


	 





	1.




	“For” proposals that require that a certain percentage (majority up to 66 2/3%) of members of a Board of Directors be comprised of independent or unaffiliated Directors.






	2.




	“For” proposals that require all members of a company's compensation, audit, nominating, or other similar committees be comprised of independent or unaffiliated Directors.






	3.




	“Against” shareholder proposals to require the addition of special interest, or constituency, representatives to Boards of Directors.






	4.




	“For” separation of the Chairman and CEO positions.






	5.




	“Against” proposals that require a company to appoint a Chairman who is an independent Director.






	Rationale

	: Board independence is a cornerstone
	of effective governance and accountability. A Board that is sufficiently independent from Management assures that shareholders'
	interests are adequately represented. However, the Chairman of the Board must have sufficient involvement in and experience with
	the operations of the company to perform the functions required of that position and lead the company.


	No Director qualifies as “independent”
	unless the Board of Directors affirmatively determines that the Director has no material relationship with the listed company (either
	directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company).


	Whether a Director is in fact not “independent” will
	depend on the laws and regulations of the primary market for the security and the exchanges, if any, on which the security trades.


	 






	D.






	Liability and Indemnification of Directors






	AM policy is to vote “for” Management
	proposals to limit Directors' liability and to broaden the indemnification of Directors, unless broader indemnification or limitations
	on Directors' liability would affect shareholders' interests in pending litigation.



	Rationale

	: While shareholders want Directors
	and officers to be responsible for their actions, it is not in the best interests of the shareholders for them to be to risk averse.
	If the risk of personal liability is too great, companies may not be able to find capable Directors willing to serve. We support
	expanding coverage only for actions taken in good faith and not for serious violations of fiduciary obligation or negligence.


	 






	E.






	Qualification of Directors






	AM policy is to follow Management’s recommended vote on either
	Management or shareholder proposals that set retirement ages for Directors or require specific levels of stock ownership by Directors.



	Rationale

	: As a general rule, the Board of Directors, and
	not the shareholders, is most qualified to establish qualification policies.


	 






	F.






	Removal of Directors and Filling of Vacancies






	AM policy is to vote “against” proposals that include provisions
	that Directors may be removed only for cause or proposals that include provisions that only continuing Directors may fill Board
	vacancies.


	Rationale: Differing state statutes permit
	removal of Directors with or without cause. Removal of Directors for cause usually requires proof of self-dealing, fraud or misappropriation
	of corporate assets, limiting shareholders' ability to remove Directors except under extreme circumstances. Removal without cause
	requires no such showing.


	Allowing only incumbent Directors to fill vacancies can serve as
	an anti-takeover device, precluding shareholders from filling the Board until the next regular election.


	 






	G.






	Proposals to Fix the Size of the Board






	AM policy is to vote:


	 





	1.




	“For” proposals to fix the size of the Board unless: (a) no specific reason for the proposed change is given; or (b) the proposal is part of a package of takeover defenses.






	2.




	“Against” proposals allowing Management to fix the size of the Board without shareholder approval.






	Rationale

	: Absent danger of anti-takeover use, companies
	should be granted a reasonable amount of flexibility in fixing the size of its Board.



	 








	H.






	Proposals to Restrict Chief Executive Officer’s Service on Multiple Boards






	AM policy is to vote “for” proposals to restrict a Chief
	Executive Officer from serving on more than three outside Boards of Directors.



	Rationale

	: Chief Executive Officer must have sufficient time
	to ensure that shareholders’ interests are represented adequately.



	Note

	: A Director’s service on multiple closed-end fund
	Boards within a fund complex are treated as service on a single Board for the purpose of the proxy voting guidelines.


	 






	I.






	Proposals to Restrict Supervisory Board Members Service on Multiple Boards






	AM policy is to vote “for” proposals to restrict a Supervisory
	Board Member from serving on more than five Supervisory Boards.



	Rationale

	: We consider a strong, independent and knowledgeable
	Supervisory Board as important counter-balance to executive Management to ensure that the interests of shareholders are fully reflected
	by the company.


	Full information should be disclosed in the annual reports and accounts
	to allow all shareholders to judge the success of the Supervisory Board controlling their company.


	Supervisory Board Members must have sufficient time to ensure that
	shareholders’ interests are represented adequately.



	Note

	: A Director’s service on multiple closed-end fund
	Boards within a fund complex are treated as service on a single Board for the purpose of the proxy voting guidelines


	 






	J.






	Proposals to Establish Audit Committees






	AM policy is to vote “for” proposals that require the establishment
	of Audit Committees.



	Rationale

	: The Audit Committee should
	deal with accounting and risk management related questions, verifies the independence of the auditor with due regard to possible
	conflicts of interest. It also should determine the procedure of the audit process.


	 






	II.






	Capital Structure








	A.






	Authorization of Additional Shares






	AM policy is to vote “for” proposals
	to increase the authorization of existing classes of stock that do not exceed a 3:1 ratio of shares authorized to shares outstanding
	for a large cap company, and do not exceed a 4:1 ratio of shares authorized to shares outstanding for a small-midcap company (companies
	having a market capitalization under one billion US dollars).



	Rationale

	: While companies need an adequate
	number of shares in order to carry on business, increases requested for general financial flexibility must be limited to protect
	shareholders from their potential use as an anti-takeover device. Requested increases for specifically designated, reasonable business
	purposes (stock split, merger, etc.) will be considered in light of those purposes and the number of shares required.


	 






	B.






	Authorization of “Blank Check” Preferred Stock






	AM policy is to vote:


	 





	1.




	“Against” proposals to create blank check preferred stock or to increase the number of authorized shares of blank check preferred stock unless the company expressly states that the stock will not be used for anti-takeover purposes and will not be issued without shareholder approval.






	2.




	“For” proposals mandating shareholder approval of blank check stock placement.






	Rationale

	: Shareholders should be permitted to monitor the
	issuance of classes of preferred stock in which the Board of Directors is given unfettered discretion to set voting, dividend,
	conversion and other rights for the shares issued.


	 






	C.






	Stock Splits / Reverse Stock Splits






	AM policy is to vote “for” stock splits
	if a legitimate business purpose is set forth and the split is in the shareholders' best interests. A vote is cast “for”
	a reverse stock split only if the number of shares authorized is reduced in the same proportion as the reverse split or if the
	effective increase in authorized shares (relative to outstanding shares) complies with the proxy guidelines for common stock increases.



	Rationale

	: Generally, stock splits do not detrimentally affect
	shareholders. Reverse stock splits, however, may have the same result as an increase in authorized shares and should be analyzed
	accordingly.


	 






	D.






	Dual Class/Supervoting Stock






	AM policy is to vote “against” proposals to create or authorize
	additional shares of super-voting stock or stock with unequal voting rights.



	Rationale

	: The “one share, one vote” principal
	ensures that no shareholder maintains a voting interest exceeding their equity interest in the company.


	 






	E.






	Large Block Issuance






	AM policy is to address large block issuances
	of stock on a case-by-case basis, incorporating the recommendation of an independent third party proxy research firm, currently
	Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”) subject to review by the GPVSC as set forth in AM’s Proxy Voting Policy
	and Guidelines.


	Additionally, AM supports proposals requiring shareholder approval
	of large block issuances.



	Rationale

	: Stock issuances must be reviewed in light of the
	business circumstances leading to the request and the potential impact on shareholder value.


	 






	F.






	Recapitalization into a Single Class of Stock






	AM policy is to vote “for” recapitalization plans to provide
	for a single class of common stock, provided the terms are fair, with no class of stock being unduly disadvantaged.



	Rationale

	: Consolidation of multiple classes of stock is
	a business decision that may be left to the Board and/or Management if there is no adverse effect on shareholders.


	 






	G.






	Share Repurchases






	AM policy is to vote “for” share repurchase plans provided
	all shareholders are able to participate on equal terms.



	Rationale

	: Buybacks are generally considered beneficial to
	shareholders because they tend to increase returns to the remaining shareholders.


	 






	H.






	Reductions in Par Value






	AM policy is to vote “for” proposals to reduce par value,
	provided a legitimate business purpose is stated (e.g., the reduction of corporate tax responsibility).



	Rationale

	: Usually, adjustments to par value are a routine
	financial decision with no substantial impact on shareholders.


	 






	III.






	Corporate Governance Issues








	A.






	Confidential Voting






	AM policy is to vote “for” proposals to provide for confidential
	voting and independent tabulation of voting results and to vote “against” proposals to repeal such provisions.



	Rationale

	: Confidential voting protects
	the privacy rights of all shareholders. This is particularly important for employee-shareholders or shareholders with business
	or other affiliations with the company, who may be vulnerable to coercion or retaliation when opposing Management. Confidential
	voting does not interfere with the ability of corporations to communicate with all shareholders, nor does it prohibit shareholders
	from making their views known directly to Management.


	 






	B.






	Cumulative Voting






	AM policy is to vote “against” shareholder
	proposals requesting cumulative voting and “for” Management proposals to eliminate it. The protections afforded shareholders
	by cumulative voting are not necessary when a company has a history of good performance and does not have a concentrated ownership
	interest. Accordingly, a vote is cast “against” cumulative voting and “for” proposals to eliminate it if:


	 





	a)




	The company has a five year return on investment greater than the relevant industry index,






	b)




	All Directors and executive officers as a group beneficially own less than 10% of the outstanding stock, and






	c)




	No shareholder (or voting block) beneficially owns 15% or more of the company.





	Thus, failure of any one of the three criteria results in a vote
	for cumulative voting in accordance with the general policy.



	Rationale

	: Cumulative voting is a tool that should be used
	to ensure that holders of a significant number of shares may have Board representation; however, the presence of other safeguards
	may make their use unnecessary.


	 






	C.






	Supermajority Voting Requirements






	AM policy is to vote “against” Management proposals to
	require a supermajority vote to amend the charter or by-laws and to vote “for” shareholder proposals to modify or rescind
	existing supermajority requirements.


	 





	*




	Exception made when company holds a controlling position and seeks to lower threshold to maintain control and/or make changes to corporate by-laws.






	Rationale

	: Supermajority voting provisions
	violate the democratic principle that a simple majority should carry the vote. Setting supermajority requirements may make it difficult
	or impossible for shareholders to remove egregious by-law or charter provisions. Occasionally, a company with a significant insider
	held position might attempt to lower a supermajority threshold to make it easier for Management to approve provisions that may
	be detrimental to shareholders. In that case, it may not be in the shareholders interests to lower the supermajority provision.



	 








	D.






	Shareholder Right to Vote






	AM policy is to vote “against” proposals that restrict
	the right of shareholders to call special meetings, amend the bylaws, or act by written consent. AM Policy is to vote “for”
	proposals that remove such restrictions.



	Rationale

	: Any reasonable means whereby shareholders can
	make their views known to Management or affect the governance process should be supported.


	 






	IV.






	Compensation






	Annual Incentive Plans or Bonus Plans are often
	submitted to shareholders for approval. These plans typically award cash to executives based on company performance. Deutsche Bank
	believes that the responsibility for executive compensation decisions rest with the Board of Directors and/or the compensation
	committee, and its policy is not to second-guess the Board’s award of cash compensation amounts to executives unless a particular
	award or series of awards is deemed excessive. If stock options are awarded as part of these bonus or incentive plans, the provisions
	must meet Deutsche Bank’s criteria regarding stock option plans, or similar stock-based incentive compensation schemes, as
	set forth below.


	 






	A.






	Establishment of a Remuneration Committee






	AM policy is to vote “for” proposals that require the establishment
	of a Remuneration Committee.



	Rationale

	: Corporations should disclose
	in each annual report or proxy statement their policies on remuneration. Essential details regarding executive remuneration including
	share options, long-term incentive plans and bonuses, should be disclosed in the annual report, so that investors can judge whether
	corporate pay policies and practices meet the standard.


	The Remuneration Committee shall not comprise
	any Board members and should be sensitive to the wider scene on executive pay. It should ensure that performance-based elements
	of executive pay are designed to align the interests of shareholders.


	 






	B.






	Executive and Director Stock Option Plans






	AM policy is to vote “for” stock option plans that meet
	the following criteria:


	 





	1.




	The resulting dilution of existing shares is less than (a) 15% of outstanding shares for large capital corporations; or (b) 20% of outstanding shares for small-mid capital companies (companies having a market capitalization under one billion US dollars).






	2.




	The transfer of equity resulting from granting options at less than fair market value (“FMV”) is no greater than 3% of the over-all market capitalization of large capital corporations or 5% of market cap for small-mid capital companies.






	3.




	The plan does not contain express repricing provisions and, in the absence of an express statement that options will not be repriced, the company does not have a history of repricing options.






	4.




	The plan does not grant options on super-voting stock.





	AM will support performance-based option proposals
	as long as (a) they do not mandate that all options granted by the company must be performance based; and (b) only certain high-level
	executives are subject to receive the performance based options.


	AM will support proposals to eliminate the payment of outside Director
	pensions.



	Rationale

	: Determining the cost to the
	company and to shareholders of stock-based incentive plans raises significant issues not encountered with cash-based compensation
	plans. These include the potential dilution of existing shareholders' voting power, the transfer of equity out of the company resulting
	from the grant and execution of options at less than FMV and the authority to reprice or replace underwater options. Our stock
	option plan analysis model seeks to allow reasonable levels of flexibility for a company yet still protect shareholders from the
	negative impact of excessive stock compensation. Acknowledging that small mid-capital corporations often rely more heavily on stock
	option plans as their main source of executive compensation and may not be able to compete with their large capital competitors
	with cash compensation, we provide slightly more flexibility for those companies.


	 






	C.






	Employee Stock Option/Purchase Plans






	AM policy is to vote for employee stock purchase plans (“ESPPs”)
	when the plan complies with Internal Revenue Code Section 423, allowing non-Management employees to purchase stock at 85% of FMV.


	AM policy is to vote “for” employee
	stock option plans (“ESOPs”) provided they meet the standards for stock option plans in general. However, when computing
	dilution and transfer of equity, ESOPs are considered independently from executive and Director option plans.



	Rationale

	: ESOPs and ESPPs encourage rank-and-file employees
	to acquire an ownership stake in the companies they work for and have been shown to promote employee loyalty and improve productivity.


	 






	D.






	Golden Parachutes






	AM policy is to vote “for” proposals
	to require shareholder approval of golden parachutes and for proposals that would limit golden parachutes to no more than three
	times base compensation. AM Policy is to vote “against” more restrictive shareholder proposals to limit golden parachutes.



	Rationale

	: In setting a reasonable limitation,
	AM considers that an effective parachute should be less attractive than continued employment and that the IRS has opined that amounts
	greater than three times annual salary, are excessive.


	 






	E.






	Proposals to Limit Benefits or Executive Compensation






	AM policy is to vote “against”


	 





	1.




	Proposals to limit benefits, pensions or compensation and






	2.




	Proposals that request or require disclosure of executive compensation greater than the disclosure required by Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations.






	Rationale

	: Levels of compensation and benefits are generally
	considered to be day-to-day operations of the company, and are best left unrestricted by arbitrary limitations proposed by shareholders.


	 






	F.






	Option Expensing






	AM policy is to support proposals requesting companies to expense stock
	options.



	Rationale

	: Although companies can choose
	to expense options voluntarily, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) does not yet require it, instead
	allowing companies to disclose the theoretical value of options as a footnote. Because the expensing of stock options lowers earnings,
	most companies elect not to do so. Given the fact that options have become an integral component of compensation and their exercise
	results in a transfer of shareholder value, AM agrees that their value should not be ignored and treated as “no cost”
	compensation. The expensing of stock options would promote more modest and appropriate use of stock options in executive compensation
	plans and present a more accurate picture of company operational earnings.


	 






	G.






	Management Board Election and Motion






	AM policy is to vote “against”:


	 





	•




	The election of Board members with positions on either Remuneration or Audit Committees;






	•




	The election of Supervisory Board members with too many Supervisory Board mandates; and






	•




	“Automatic” election of former Board members into the Supervisory Board.






	Rationale

	: Management as an entity, and each of its members,
	are responsible for all actions of the company, and are - subject to applicable laws and regulations - accountable to the shareholders
	as a whole for their actions.


	Sufficient information should be disclosed in the annual company
	report and account to allow shareholders to judge the success of the company.


	 






	H.






	Remuneration (Variable Pay)







	Executive remuneration for Management Board



	AM policy is to vote “for” Management Board remuneration
	that is transparent and linked to results.



	Rationale

	: Executive compensation should
	motivate Management and align the interests of Management with the shareholders. The focus should be on criteria that prevent excessive
	remuneration; but enable the company to hire and retain first-class professionals.


	Shareholder interests are normally best served when Management is
	remunerated to optimize long-term returns. Criteria should include suitable measurements like return on capital employed or economic
	value added.


	Interests should generally also be correctly aligned when Management
	own shares in the company – even more so if these shares represent a substantial portion of their own wealth.


	Its disclosure shall differentiate between fixed pay, variable (performance
	related) pay and long-term incentives, including stock option plans with valuation ranges as well as pension and any other significant
	arrangements.



	Executive remuneration for Supervisory Board



	AM policy is to vote “for” remuneration for Supervisory
	Board that is at least 50% in fixed form.



	Rationale

	: It would normally be preferable
	if performance linked compensation were not based on dividend payments, but linked to suitable result based parameters. Consulting
	and procurement services should also be published in the company report.


	 






	I.






	Long-Term Incentive Plans






	AM policy is to vote “for” long-term incentive plans for
	members of Management Boards that reward for above average company performance.



	Rationale

	: Incentive plans will normally be supported if
	they:


	 





	•




	Directly align the interests of members of Management Boards with those of shareholders;






	•




	Establish challenging performance criteria to reward only above average performance;






	•




	Measure performance by total shareholder return in relation to the market or a range of comparable companies;






	•




	Are long-term in nature and encourage long-term ownership of the shares once exercised through minimum holding periods; and






	•




	Do not allow a repricing of the exercise price in stock option plans.





	 


	 






	J.






	Shareholder Proposals Concerning “Pay for Superior Performance”






	AM policy is to address pay for superior performance
	proposals on a case-by-case basis, incorporating the recommendation of an independent third party proxy research firm (currently
	ISS) subject to review by the GPVSC as set forth in AM’s Proxy Policy and Guidelines.



	Rationale

	: While AM agrees that compensation
	issues are better left to the discretion of Management, there remains the need to monitor for excessive compensation practices
	on a case-by-case basis. If, after a review of the ISS metrics, AM is comfortable with ISS’s applying this calculation and
	will vote according to their recommendation.


	 






	K.






	Executive Compensation Advisory






	AM policy is to follow Management’s recommended vote on shareholder
	proposals to propose an advisory resolution seeking to ratify the compensation of the company’s named executive officers
	(“NEOs”) on an annual basis.



	Rationale

	: AM believes that controls
	exist within senior Management and corporate compensation committees, ensuring fair compensation to executives. This might allow
	shareholders to require approval for all levels of Management’s compensation.


	 






	L.






	Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation






	AM policy is to evaluate Executive Compensation
	proposals on a case-by-case basis, where locally defined this may be done by incorporating the recommendation of an independent
	third party proxy research firm. AM will oppose Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation if:


	 





	1.




	There is a significant misalignment between CEO pay and company performance;






	2.




	The company maintains significant problematic pay practices; and/or






	3.




	The Board exhibits a significant level of poor communication and responsiveness to shareholders.






	Rationale

	: While AM agrees that compensation issues are better
	left to the discretion of Management, there remains a need to take action on this nonbinding proposal if excessive compensation
	practices exist.


	 






	M.






	Frequency of Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation






	AM policy is to vote “for” annual advisory votes on compensation,
	which provide the most consistent and clear communication channel for shareholder concerns about companies’ executive pay
	programs.



	Rationale

	: AM believes that annual advisory vote gives shareholders
	the opportunity to express any compensation concerns to the Executive Compensation proposal which is an advisory voting.


	 






	V.






	Anti-Takeover Related Issues








	A.






	Sha

	reho

	lder Rights Plans (“Poison Pills”)






	AM policy is to vote “for” proposals to require shareholder
	ratification of poison pills or that request Boards to redeem poison pills, and to vote “against” the adoption of poison
	pills if they are submitted for shareholder ratification.



	Rationale

	: Poison pills are the most
	prevalent form of corporate takeover defenses and can be (and usually are) adopted without shareholder review or consent. The potential
	cost of poison pills to shareholders during an attempted takeover outweighs the benefits.


	 






	B.






	Reincorporation






	AM policy is to examine reincorporation proposals on a case-by-case
	basis. The voting decision is based on:


	 





	1.




	Differences in state law between the existing state of incorporation and the proposed state of incorporation; and






	2.




	Differences between the existing and the proposed charter/bylaws/articles of incorporation and their effect on shareholder rights.





	 


	If changes resulting from the proposed reincorporation violate the
	corporate governance principles set forth in these guidelines, the reincorporation will be deemed contrary to shareholder’s
	interests and a vote cast “against.”



	Rationale

	: Reincorporations can be properly analyzed only
	by looking at the advantages and disadvantages to their shareholders. Care must be taken that anti-takeover protection is not the
	sole or primary result of a proposed change.


	 






	C.






	Fair-Price Proposals






	AM policy is to vote “for” Management fair-price proposals,
	provided that:


	 





	1.




	The proposal applies only to two-tier offers;






	2.




	The proposal sets an objective fair-price test based on the highest price that the acquirer has paid for a company's shares;






	3.




	The supermajority requirement for bids that fail the fair-price test is no higher than two-thirds of the outstanding shares; and






	4.




	The proposal contains no other anti-takeover provisions or provisions that restrict shareholders rights.





	A vote is cast for shareholder proposals that would modify or repeal
	existing fair-price requirements that do not meet these standards.



	Rationale

	: While fair price provisions
	may be used as anti-takeover devices, if adequate provisions are included, they provide some protection to shareholders who have
	some say in their application and the ability to reject those protections if desired.


	 






	D.






	Exemption from State Takeover Laws






	AM policy is to vote “for” shareholder proposals to opt
	out of state takeover laws and to vote “against” Management proposals requesting to opt out of state takeover laws.



	Rationale

	: Control share statutes, enacted at the state level,
	may harm long-term share value by entrenching Management. They also unfairly deny certain shares their inherent voting rights.


	 






	E.






	Non-Financial Effects of Takeover Bids






	Policy is to vote “against” shareholder proposals to require
	consideration of non-financial effects of merger or acquisition proposals.



	Rationale

	: Non-financial effects may often be subjective
	and are secondary to AM’s stated purpose of acting in its client’s best economic interest.


	 






	VI.






	Mergers & Acquisitions






	Evaluation of mergers, acquisitions and other
	special corporate transactions (i.e., takeovers, spin-offs, sales of assets, reorganizations, restructurings and recapitalizations)
	are performed on a case-by-case basis incorporating information from an independent proxy research source (currently ISS.) Additional
	resources including portfolio management and research analysts may be considered as set forth in AM’s policies and procedures.


	 






	VII.






	Environmental, Social and Governance Issues






	Environmental, social and governance issues (ESG)
	are becoming increasingly important to corporate success. We incorporate ESG considerations into both our investment decisions
	and our proxy voting decisions – particularly if the financial performance of the company could be impacted. Companies or
	states that seriously contravene internationally accepted ethical principles will be subject to heightened scrutiny.


	 






	A.






	Principles for Responsible Investment






	AM policy is to actively engage with companies
	on ESG issues and participate in ESG initiatives. In this context, AM (a) votes “for” increased disclosure on ESG issues;
	(b) is willing to participate in the development of policy, regulation, and standard setting (such as promoting and protecting
	shareholder rights); (c) could support shareholder initiatives


	and also file shareholder resolutions with long term
	ESG considerations and improved ESG disclosure, when applicable; (d) could support standardized ESG reporting and issues to be
	integrated within annual financial reports; and (e) on a case-by-case basis, will generally follow Management’s recommended
	vote on other matters related to ESG issues.



	Rationale

	: ESG issues can affect the performance of investment
	portfolios (to varying degrees across companies, sectors, regions, asset classes and through time).


	 






	B.






	ESG Issues






	AM policy is to vote in line with the Coalition
	for Environmentally Responsible Economies (“CERES”) recommendation on Environmental matters contained in the CERES
	Principles and the recommendations on Social and Sustainability issues not specifically addressed elsewhere in these Guidelines.
	AM will rely on ISS to identify shareholder proposals addressing CERES Principles and proxies will be voted in accordance with
	ISS's predetermined voting guidelines on CERES Principles.


	Any matter that is to be voted on, consented to or approved by the
	voting members, may take place in person, telephonically or via other electronic means. In addition, voting members may act in
	writing, including without limitation, via e-mail.



	Rationale

	: AM supports the CERES Principles and as such generally
	votes proxies in line with the CERES recommendation.


	 






	C.






	Labor and Human Rights






	AM policy is to vote “against” adopting global codes of
	conduct or workplace standards exceeding those mandated by law.



	Rationale

	: Additional requirements beyond those mandated
	by law are deemed unnecessary and potentially burdensome to companies


	 






	D.






	Diversity and Equality







	1.




	AM policy is to vote “against” shareholder proposals to force equal employment opportunity, affirmative action or Board diversity.






	Rationale

	: Compliance with State and
	Federal legislation along with information made available through filings with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”)
	provides sufficient assurance that companies act responsibly and make information public.


	 





	2.




	AM policy is also to vote “against” proposals to adopt the MacBride Principles. The MacBride Principles promote fair employment, specifically regarding religious discrimination.






	Rationale

	: Compliance with the Fair Employment Act of 1989
	makes adoption of the MacBride Principles redundant. Their adoption could potentially lead to charges of reverse discrimination.


	 






	E.






	Health and Safety







	1.




	AM policy is to vote “against” adopting a pharmaceutical price restraint policy or reporting pricing policy changes.






	Rationale

	: Pricing is an integral part
	of business for pharmaceutical companies and should not be dictated by shareholders (particularly pursuant to an arbitrary formula).
	Disclosing pricing policies may also jeopardize a company’s competitive position in the marketplace.


	 





	2.




	AM policy is to vote “against” shareholder proposals to control the use or labelling of and reporting on genetically engineered products.






	Rationale

	: Additional requirements beyond those mandated
	by law are deemed unnecessary and potentially burdensome to companies.


	 






	F.






	Government/Military







	1.




	AM policy is to vote against shareholder proposals regarding the production or sale of military arms or nuclear or space-based weapons, including proposals seeking to dictate a company's interaction with a particular foreign country or agency.






	Rationale

	: Generally, Management is
	in a better position to determine what products or industries a company can and should participate in. Regulation of the production
	or distribution of military supplies is, or should be, a matter of government policy.


	 





	2.




	AM policy is to vote “against” shareholder proposals regarding political contributions and donations.






	Rationale

	: The Board of Directors and Management, not shareholders,
	should evaluate and determine the recipients of any contributions made by the company.


	 





	3.




	AM policy is to vote “against” shareholder proposals regarding charitable contributions and donations.






	Rationale

	: The Board of Directors and Management, not shareholders,
	should evaluate and determine the recipients of any contributions made by the company.


	 






	G.






	Tobacco







	1.




	AM policy is to vote “against” shareholder proposals requesting additional standards or reporting requirements for tobacco companies as well as “against” requesting companies to report on the intentional manipulation of nicotine content.






	Rationale

	: Where a tobacco company’s
	actions meet the requirements of legal and industry standards, imposing additional burdens may detrimentally affect a company's
	ability to compete. The disclosure of nicotine content information could affect the company's rights in any pending or future litigation.


	 





	2.




	Shareholder requests to spin-off or restructure tobacco businesses will be opposed.






	Rationale

	: These decisions are more appropriately left to
	the Board and Management, and not to shareholder mandate.


	 






	VIII.






	Miscellaneous Items








	A.






	Ratification of Auditors






	AM policy is to vote “for” (a) the Management recommended
	selection of auditors and (b) proposals to require shareholder approval of auditors.



	Rationale

	: Absent evidence that auditors have not performed
	their duties adequately, support for Management’s nomination is warranted.


	 






	B.






	Limitation of Non-Audit Services provided by Independent Auditor






	AM policy is to support proposals limiting non-audit fees to 50% of
	the aggregate annual fees earned by the firm retained as a company's independent auditor.



	Rationale

	: In the wake of financial
	reporting problems and alleged audit failures at a number of companies, AM supports the general principle that companies should
	retain separate firms for audit and consulting services to avoid potential conflicts of interest. However, given the protections
	afforded by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (which requires Audit Committee pre-approval for non-audit services and prohibits auditors
	from providing specific types of services), and the fact that some non-audit services are legitimate audit-related services, complete
	separation of audit and consulting fees may not be warranted. A reasonable limitation is appropriate to help ensure auditor independence
	and it is reasonable to expect that audit fees exceed non-audit fees.


	 






	C.






	Audit Firm Rotation






	AM policy is to vote against proposals seeking audit firm rotation.



	Rationale

	: While the Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates that the
	lead audit partner be switched every five years, AM believes that rotation of the actual audit firm would be costly and disruptive.


	 






	D.






	Transaction of Other Business






	AM policy is to vote “against” transaction of other business
	proposals.



	Rationale

	: This is a routine item to
	allow shareholders to raise other issues and discuss them at the meeting. As the nature of these issues may not be disclosed prior
	to the meeting, we recommend a vote against these proposals. This protects shareholders voting by proxy (and not physically present
	at a meeting) from having action taken at the meeting that they did not receive proper notification of or sufficient opportunity
	to consider.


	 






	E.






	Motions to Adjourn the Meeting






	AM Policy is to vote “against” proposals to adjourn the
	meeting.



	Rationale

	: Management may seek authority
	to adjourn the meeting if a favorable outcome is not secured. Shareholders should already have had enough information to make a
	decision. Once votes have been cast, there is no justification for Management to continue spending time and money to press shareholders
	for support.


	 






	F.






	Bundled Proposals






	AM policy is to vote against bundled proposals
	if any bundled issue would require a vote against it if proposed individually.



	Rationale

	: Shareholders should not be forced to “take
	the good with the bad” in cases where the proposals could reasonably have been submitted separately.


	 






	G.






	Change of Company Name






	AM policy is to support Management on proposals to change the company
	name.



	Rationale

	: This is generally considered a business decision
	for a company.



	 








	H.






	Proposals Related to the Annual Meeting






	AM Policy is to vote “for” Management for proposals related
	to the conduct of the annual meeting (meeting time, place, etc.)



	Rationale

	: These are considered routine administrative proposals.


	 






	I.






	Reimbursement of Expenses Incurred from Candidate Nomination






	AM policy is to follow Management’s recommended
	vote on shareholder proposals related to the amending of company bylaws to provide for the reimbursement of reasonable expenses
	incurred in connection with nominating one or more candidates in a contested election of Directors to the corporation’s Board
	of Directors.



	Rationale

	: Corporations should not be liable for costs associated
	with shareholder proposals for Directors.


	 






	J.






	Investment Company Proxies






	Proxies solicited by investment companies are
	voted in accordance with the recommendations of an independent third party, currently ISS. However, regarding investment companies
	for which AM or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or principal underwriter, such proxies are voted in the same proportion
	as the vote of all other shareholders. Proxies solicited by master funds from feeder funds will be voted in accordance with applicable
	provisions of Section 12 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”).


	Investment companies, particularly closed-end
	investment companies, are different from traditional operating companies. These differences may call for differences in voting
	positions on the same matter. For example, AM could vote “for” staggered Boards of closed-end investment companies,
	although AM generally votes “against” staggered Boards for operating companies. Further, the manner in which AM votes
	investment company proxies may differ from proposals for which an AM-advised investment company solicits proxies from its shareholders.
	As reflected in the Guidelines, proxies solicited by closed-end (and open-end) investment companies are voted in accordance with
	the pre-determined guidelines of an independent third-party.


	Subject to participation agreements with certain
	Exchange Traded Funds (“ETF”) issuers that have received exemptive orders from the US Securities and Exchange Commission
	allowing investing Deutsche funds to exceed the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Investment Company Act,
	DeAM will echo vote proxies for ETFs in which Deutsche Bank holds more than 25% of outstanding voting shares globally when required
	to do so by participation agreements and SEC orders.



	Note

	: With respect to the Central Cash
	Management Fund (registered under the Investment Company Act), the Fund is not required to engage in echo voting and the investment
	adviser will use these Guidelines, and may determine, with respect to the Central Cash Management Fund, to vote contrary to the
	positions in the Guidelines, consistent with the Fund’s best interest.


	 






	K.






	International Proxy Voting






	The above guidelines pertain to issuers organized
	in the United States, Canada and Germany. Proxies solicited by other issuers are voted in accordance with international guidelines
	or the recommendation of ISS and in accordance with applicable law and regulation.

	PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES






	 


	 







	Portfolio Manager Disclosure




	 



	The following individual handles the day-to-day management of the Fund.


	 


	Gerd Kirsten, CFA, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager of the Fund


	 







	·




	Senior Portfolio Manager, Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management
	International GmbH: Frankfurt










	·




	Joined Deutsche Asset Management and the Fund in 2009.










	·




	Previously, 1990-99 worked in New York for HVB Capital, the
	US investment bank of Hypovereinsbank and 1999-2004 with Deka Investment as senior portfolio manager, 2004-2009 Partner and Managing
	Director of F&V Vermoegensverwaltung AG and fund manager of the innovative Dynamic Europe Fund.

	in Banking from Technical University, Berlin





	Compensation of Portfolio Managers


	 


	Portfolio managers are paid on a Total Compensation basis, which includes:
	(i) fixed pay (base salary), which is linked to job function, responsibilities and internal and external peer comparison, and (ii)
	variable compensation, which is discretionary and linked to investment performance, individual contribution, and the overall financial
	results of both Deutsche Asset Management and Deutsche Bank AG. Variable compensation can be delivered via a short-term and/or
	long-term vehicle, namely cash, equity upfront awards, restricted equity awards, and/or restricted incentive awards. Additionally,
	to better align the interests of investors and portfolio managers, a portion of the long term variable compensation that portfolio
	managers receive will be designated for investments in shares of the funds they manage, where possible. Variable compensation comprises
	a greater proportion of total compensation as the portfolio manager’s seniority and total compensation level increase. The
	proportion of variable compensation delivered via a long-term incentive award, which is subject to clawback, increases significantly
	as the amount of variable compensation increases. All variable compensation delivered via a long-term incentive award is subject
	to clawback.


	To evaluate its investment professionals, Deutsche Asset Management
	reviews investment performance for all accounts managed in relation to both account peer group and benchmark related data (i.e.,
	appropriate Morningstar peer group universes and/or benchmark index(es) with respect to each account). The ultimate goal of this
	process is to evaluate the degree to which investment professionals deliver investment performance that meets or exceeds their
	clients’ risk and return objectives. When determining Total Compensation, Deutsche Asset Management considers a number of
	quantitative and qualitative factors:


	 







	·




	Quantitative measures (e.g. one-, three- and five-year pre-tax
	returns versus the benchmark and appropriate peer group, taking risk targets into account) are utilized to measure performance.










	·




	Qualitative measures (e.g. adherence to, as well as contributions
	to, the enhancement of the investment process) are included in the performance review.










	·




	Other factors (e.g. non-investment related performance, teamwork,
	adherence to compliance rules, risk management and "living the values" of Deutsche Asset Management) are included as
	part of a discretionary component of the review process, giving management the ability to consider additional markers of performance
	on a subjective basis.





	Fund Ownership of Portfolio Managers


	The following table shows the dollar range of Fund shares owned beneficially
	and of record by each member of the Fund’s portfolio management team as well as in all US registered Funds advised by Deutsche
	Asset & Wealth Management International GmbH (DeAMI) as a group (the “Family of Funds”), including investments
	by their immediate family members sharing the same household and amounts invested through retirement and deferred compensation
	plans. This information is provided as of the Fund’s most recent fiscal year end.

	Conflicts of Interest


	In addition to managing the assets of the Fund, the Fund’s portfolio
	managers may have responsibility for managing other client accounts of the Advisor or its affiliates. The tables below show, for
	each portfolio manager, the number and asset size of (1) SEC registered investment companies (or series thereof) other than the
	Fund, (2) pooled investment vehicles that are not registered investment companies and (3) other accounts (e.g., accounts managed
	for individuals or organizations) managed by each portfolio manager. Total assets attributed to each portfolio manager in the tables
	below include total assets of each account managed by them, although the manager may only manage a portion of such account’s
	assets. For Funds subadvised by subadvisors unaffiliated with DeAMI, total assets of Funds managed may only include assets allocated
	to the portfolio manager and not the total assets of each Fund managed. The tables also show the number of performance based fee
	accounts, as well as the total assets of the accounts for which the advisory fee is based on the performance of the account. This
	information is provided as of the Fund’s most recent fiscal year end.

	In addition to the accounts above, an investment professional may manage
	accounts in a personal capacity that may include holdings that are similar to, or the same as, those of the Funds. The Advisor
	has in place a Code of Ethics that is designed to address conflicts of interest and that, among other things, imposes restrictions
	on the ability of portfolio managers and other “access persons” to invest in securities that may be recommended or
	traded in the Funds and other client accounts.



	 



	Real, potential or apparent conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio
	manager has day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities with respect to more than one fund or account, including the following:


	 







	·




	Certain investments may be appropriate for the Fund and also
	for other clients advised by the Advisor, including other client accounts managed by the Fund’s portfolio management team.
	Investment decisions for the Fund and other clients are made with a view to achieving their respective investment objectives and
	after consideration of such factors as their current holdings, availability of cash for investment and the size of their investments
	generally. A particular security may be bought or sold for only one client or in different amounts and at different times for more
	than one but less than all clients. Likewise, because clients of the Advisor may have differing investment strategies, a particular
	security may be bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients are selling the security. The investment results
	achieved for the Fund may differ from the results achieved for other clients of the Advisor. In addition, purchases or sales of
	the same security may be made for two or more clients on the same day. In such event, such transactions will be allocated among
	the clients in a manner believed by the Advisor to be most equitable to each client, generally utilizing a pro rata allocation
	methodology. In some cases, the allocation procedure could potentially have an adverse effect or positive effect on the price or
	amount of the securities purchased or sold by the Fund. Purchase and sale orders for the Fund may be combined with those of other
	clients of the Advisor in the interest of achieving the most favorable net results to the Fund and the other clients.










	·




	To the extent that a portfolio manager has responsibilities
	for managing multiple client accounts, a portfolio manager will need to divide time and attention among relevant accounts. The
	Advisor attempts to minimize these conflicts by aligning its portfolio management teams by investment strategy and by employing
	similar investment models across multiple client accounts.










	·




	In some cases, an apparent conflict may arise where the Advisor
	has an incentive, such as a performance-based fee, in managing one account and not with respect to other accounts it manages. The
	Advisor will not determine allocations based on whether it receives a performance-based fee from the client. Additionally, the
	Advisor has in place supervisory oversight processes to periodically monitor performance deviations for accounts with like strategies.










	·




	The Advisor and its affiliates and the investment team of
	each Fund may manage other mutual funds and separate accounts on a long only or a long-short basis. The simultaneous management
	of long and short portfolios creates potential conflicts of interest including the risk that short sale activity could adversely
	affect the market value of the long positions (and vice versa), the risk arising from sequential orders in long and short positions,
	and the risks associated with receiving opposing orders at the same time. The Advisor has adopted procedures that it believes are
	reasonably designed to mitigate these and other potential conflicts of interest. Included in these procedures are specific guidelines
	developed to provide fair and equitable treatment for all clients whose accounts are managed by each Fund’s portfolio management
	team. The Advisor and the portfolio management team have established monitoring procedures, a protocol for supervisory reviews,
	as well as compliance oversight to ensure that potential conflicts of interest relating to this type of activity are properly addressed.





	The Advisor is owned by Deutsche Bank AG, a
	multi-national financial services company. Therefore, the Advisor is affiliated with a variety of entities that provide, and/or
	engage in commercial banking, insurance, brokerage, investment banking, financial advisory, broker-dealer activities (including
	sales and trading), hedge funds, real estate and private equity investing, in addition to the provision of investment management
	services to institutional and individual investors. Since Deutsche Bank AG, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees (the
	“Firm”) are engaged in businesses and have interests in addition to managing asset management accounts, such wide ranging
	activities involve real, potential or apparent conflicts of interest. These interests and activities include potential advisory,
	transactional and financial activities and other interests in securities and companies that may be directly or indirectly purchased
	or sold by the Firm for its clients’ advisory accounts. The Advisor may take investment positions in securities in which
	other clients or related persons within the Firm have different investment positions. There may be instances in which the Advisor
	is purchasing or selling for its client accounts, or pursuing an outcome in the context of a workout or restructuring with respect
	to, securities in which the Firm is undertaking the same or differing strategy in other businesses or other client accounts. These
	are considerations of which advisory clients should be aware and which may cause conflicts that could be to the disadvantage of
	the Advisor’s advisory clients, including the Fund. The Advisor has instituted business and compliance policies, procedures
	and disclosures that are designed to identify, monitor and mitigate conflicts of interest and, as appropriate, to report them to
	a Fund’s Board.

	On July 28, 2014, the Fund announced that the Board of Directors approved the extension of the current repurchase authorization permitting the Fund to repurchase up to 950,000 shares during the period from August 1, 2014 through July 31, 2015.  Under this plan, the Fund repurchased 260,755 shares in open market transactions from August 1, 2014 to July 31, 2015.





	 





	On July 27, 2015, the Fund announced that the Board of Directors approved the extension of the current repurchase authorization permitting the Fund to repurchase up to 874,000 shares during the period from August 1, 2015 through July 31, 2016.  Under this plan, the Fund repurchased 79,011 shares in open market transactions from August 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015.





	 





	In addition, on July 28, 2014 the Fund announced that its Board adopted a new Discount Management Program whereby the Fund will initiate one contingent tender offer during the period from August 1, 2014 through July 31, 2015 for 5% of the Fund’s shares outstanding at 98% of net asset value (“NAV”).  The terms of the Discount Management Program require the Fund to conduct a tender offer if its shares trade at an average discount to NAV of more than 10% during a fifteen-week measurement period that has been determined by the Fund’s Board of Directors.  During the measurement period that commenced on September 2, 2014 and expired on December 12, 2014, the Fund's shares traded at an average discount to NAV of 10.93%.  Therefore, the Fund conducted a tender offer which commenced on January 22, 2015 and expired on February 20, 2015.  The Fund accepted 459,259 shares (which represented 5% of the Fund's outstanding common shares) at a price equal to 98% of NAV per shares as of the close of the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange on February 23, 2015.  The shares accepted for payment received cash at a repurchase price of $9.47 per share.

	SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS






	 


	 




	 



	There were no material changes to the procedures by which stockholders may recommend nominees to the Fund’s Board.  The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider nominee candidates properly submitted by stockholders in accordance with applicable law, the Fund's Articles of Incorporation or By-laws, resolutions of the Board and the qualifications and procedures set forth in the Nominating and Governance Committee Charter and this proxy statement. The Nominating and Governance Committee's Charter requires that a stockholder or group of stockholders seeking to submit a nominee candidate (i) must have beneficially owned at least 5% of the Fund's common stock for at least two years, (ii) may submit only one nominee candidate for any particular meeting of stockholders, and (iii) may submit a nominee candidate for only an annual meeting or other meeting of stockholders at which directors will be elected. The stockholder or group of stockholders must provide notice of the proposed nominee pursuant to the requirements found in the Fund's By-laws.  Generally, this notice must be received not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice for the preceding year's annual meeting. Such notice shall include the specific information required by the Fund's By-laws. The Nominating and Governance Committee will evaluate nominee candidates properly submitted by stockholders on the same basis as it considers and evaluates candidates recommended by other sources.

	I.  






	Overview







	 



	This Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer Code of Ethics (“Officer Code”) sets forth the policies, practices, and values expected to be exhibited in the conduct of the Principal Executive Officers and Principal Financial Officers of the investment companies (“Funds”) they serve (“Covered Officers”).  A list of Covered Officers and Funds is included on Appendix A.







	The Boards of the Funds listed on Appendix A have elected to implement the Officer Code, pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC’s rules thereunder, to promote and demonstrate honest and ethical conduct in their Covered Officers.







	Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management or its affiliates (“DeAWM”) serves as the investment adviser to each Fund.  All Covered Officers are also employees of DeAWM or an affiliate.  Thus, in addition to adhering to the Officer Code, these individuals must comply with DeAWM policies and procedures, such as the DeAWM Code of Ethics governing personal trading activities, as adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940.


	1


	  In addition, such individuals also must comply with other applicable Fund policies and procedures.







	The DeAWM Compliance Officer, who shall not be a Covered Officer and who shall serve as such subject to the approval of the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof), is primarily responsible for implementing and enforcing this Code.  The Compliance Officer has the authority to interpret this Officer Code and its applicability to particular circumstances. Any questions about the Officer Code should be directed to the DeAWM Compliance Officer.







	The DeAWM Compliance Officer and his or her contact information can be found in Appendix A.



	 









	1

	The obligations imposed by the Officer Code are separate from, and in addition to, any obligations imposed under codes of ethics adopted pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and any other code of conduct applicable to Covered Officers in whatever capacity they serve.  The Officer Code does not incorporate any of those other codes and, accordingly, violations of those codes will not necessarily be considered violations of the Officer Code and waivers granted under those codes would not necessarily require a waiver to be granted under this Code.  Sanctions imposed under those codes may be considered in determining appropriate sanctions for any violation of this Code.


	 








	II.  






	Purposes of the Officer Code







	 



	The purposes of the Officer Code are to deter wrongdoing and to:











	·  






	promote honest and ethical conduct among Covered Officers, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;












	·  






	promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosures in reports and documents that the Funds file with or submit to the SEC (and in other public communications from the Funds) and that are within the Covered Officer’s responsibilities;












	·  






	promote compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations;












	·  






	encourage the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Officer Code to the DeAWM Compliance Officer; and












	·  






	establish accountability for adherence to the Officer Code.











	Any questions about the Officer Code should be referred to DeAWM’s Compliance Officer.






	 







	III.  






	Responsibilities of Covered Officers







	 


	 



	A.


	 


	Honest and Ethical Conduct



	 



	It is the duty of every Covered Officer to encourage and demonstrate honest and ethical conduct, as well as adhere to and require adherence to the Officer Code and any other applicable policies and procedures designed to promote this behavior.  Covered Officers must at all times conduct themselves with integrity and distinction, putting first the interests of the Fund(s) they serve.   Covered Officers must be honest and candid while maintaining confidentiality of information where required by law, DeAWM policy or Fund policy.







	Covered Officers also must, at all times, act in good faith, responsibly and with due care, competence and diligence, without misrepresenting or being misleading about material facts or allowing their independent judgment to be subordinated.  Covered Officers also should maintain skills appropriate and necessary for the performance of their duties for the Fund(s).  Covered Officers also must responsibly use and control all Fund assets and resources entrusted to them.







	Covered Officers may not retaliate against others for, or otherwise discourage the reporting of, actual or apparent violations of the Officer Code or applicable laws or regulations.  Covered Officers should create an environment that encourages the exchange of information, including concerns of the type that this Code is designed to address.



	 


	 



	B.


	 


	Conflicts of Interest



	 



	A “conflict of interest” occurs when a Covered Officer’s personal interests interfere with the interests of the Fund for which he or she serves as an officer. Covered Officers may not improperly use their position with a Fund for personal or private gain to themselves, their family, or any other person.  Similarly, Covered Officers may not use their personal influence or personal relationships to influence decisions or other Fund business or operational matters where they would benefit personally at the Fund’s expense or to the Fund’s detriment.  Covered Officers may not cause the Fund to take action, or refrain from taking action, for their personal benefit at the Fund’s expense or to the Fund’s detriment.  Some examples of conflicts of interest follow (this is not an all-inclusive list):  being in the position of supervising, reviewing or having any influence on the job evaluation, pay or benefit of any immediate family member who is an employee of a Fund service provider or is otherwise associated with the Fund; or having an ownership interest in, or having any consulting or employment relationship with, any Fund service provider other than DeAWM or its affiliates.



	 



	Certain conflicts of interest covered by this Code arise out of the relationships between Covered Officers and the Fund that already are subject to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act.  For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of their status as “affiliated persons” of the Fund.  Covered Officers must comply with applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, any violations of existing statutory and regulatory prohibitions on individual behavior could be considered a violation of this Code.







	As to conflicts arising from, or as a result of the advisory relationship (or any other relationships) between the Fund and DeAWM, of which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees, it is recognized by the Board that, subject to DeAWM’s fiduciary duties to the Fund, the Covered Officers will in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for DeAWM, or for both) be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions which will have different effects on DeAWM and the Fund.  The Board recognizes that the participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contract relationship between the Fund and DeAWM, and is consistent with the expectation of the Board of the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund.







	Covered Officers should avoid actual conflicts of interest, and appearances of conflicts of interest, between the Covered Officer’s duties to the Fund and his or her personal interests beyond those contemplated or anticipated by applicable regulatory schemes.  If a Covered Officer suspects or knows of a conflict or an appearance of one, the Covered Officer must immediately report the matter to the DeAWM Compliance Officer.  If a Covered Officer, in lieu of reporting such a matter to the DeAWM Compliance Officer, may report the matter directly to the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof), as appropriate (e.g., if the conflict involves the DeAWM Compliance Officer or the Covered Officer reasonably believes it would be futile to report the matter to the DeAWM Compliance Officer).







	When actual, apparent or suspected conflicts of interest arise in connection with a Covered Officer, DeAWM personnel aware of the matter should promptly contact the DeAWM Compliance Officer.  There will be no reprisal or retaliation against the person reporting the matter.







	Upon receipt of a report of a possible conflict, the DeAWM Compliance Officer will take steps to determine whether a conflict exists.  In so doing, the DeAWM Compliance Officer may take any actions he or she determines to be appropriate in his or her sole discretion and may use all reasonable resources, including retaining or engaging legal counsel, accounting firms or other consultants, subject to applicable law.


	2


	  The costs associated with such actions may be borne by the Fund, if appropriate, after consultation with the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof).  Otherwise, such costs will be borne by DeAWM or other appropriate Fund service provider.







	After full review of a report of a possible conflict of interest, the DeAWM Compliance Officer may determine that no conflict or reasonable appearance of a conflict exists.  If, however, the DeAWM Compliance Officer determines that an actual conflict exists, the Compliance Officer will resolve the conflict solely in the interests of the Fund, and will report the conflict and its resolution to the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof).  If the DeAWM Compliance Officer determines that the appearance of a conflict exists, the DeAWM Compliance Officer will take appropriate steps to remedy such appearance.  In lieu of determining whether a conflict exists and/or resolving a conflict, the DeAWM Compliance Officer instead may refer the matter to the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof), as appropriate.  However, the DeAWM Compliance Officer must refer the matter to the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof) if the DeAWM Compliance Officer is directly involved in the conflict or under similar appropriate circumstances.







	After responding to a report of a possible conflict of interest, the DeAWM Compliance Officer will discuss the matter with the person reporting it (and with the Covered Officer at issue, if different) for purposes of educating those involved on conflicts of interests (including how to detect and avoid them, if appropriate).







	Appropriate resolution of conflicts may restrict the personal activities of the Covered Officer and/or his family, friends or other persons.







	Solely because a conflict is disclosed to the DeAWM Compliance Officer (and/or the Board or Committee thereof) and/or resolved by the DeAWM Compliance Officer does not mean that the conflict or its resolution constitutes a waiver from the Code’s requirements.







	Any questions about conflicts of interests, including whether a particular situation might be a conflict or an appearance of one, should be directed to the DeAWM Compliance Officer.



	 






	2

	 For example, retaining a Fund’s independent accounting firm may require pre-approval by the Fund’s audit committee.


	 



	C.


	 


	Use of Personal Fund Shareholder Information



	 



	A Covered Officer may not use or disclose personal information about Fund shareholders, except in the performance of his or her duties for the Fund.  Each Covered Officer also must abide by the Funds’ and DeAWM’s privacy policies under SEC Regulation S-P.






	 



	D.


	 


	Public Communications



	 



	In connection with his or her responsibilities for or involvement with a Fund’s public communications and disclosure documents (e.g., shareholder reports, registration statements, press releases), each Covered Officer must provide information to Fund service providers (within the DeAWM organization or otherwise) and to the Fund’s Board (and any committees thereof), independent auditors, government regulators and self-regulatory organizations that is fair, accurate, complete, objective, relevant, timely and understandable.







	Further, within the scope of their duties, Covered Officers having direct or supervisory authority over Fund disclosure documents or other public Fund communications will, to the extent appropriate within their area of responsibility, endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate and understandable disclosure in Fund disclosure documents.  Such Covered Officers will oversee, or appoint others to oversee, processes for the timely and accurate creation and review of all public reports and regulatory filings.  Within the scope of his or her responsibilities as a Covered Officer, each Covered Officer also will familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements applicable to the Fund, as well as the business and financial operations of the Fund.  Each Covered Officer also will adhere to, and will promote adherence to, applicable disclosure controls, processes and procedures, including DeAWM’s Disclosure Controls and Procedures, which govern the process by which Fund disclosure documents are created and reviewed.







	To the extent that Covered Officers participate in the creation of a Fund’s books or records, they must do so in a way that promotes the accuracy, fairness and timeliness of those records.






	 



	E.


	 


	Compliance with Applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations



	 



	In connection with his or her duties and within the scope of his or her responsibilities as a Covered Officer, each Covered Officer must comply with governmental laws, rules and regulations, accounting standards, and Fund policies/procedures that apply to his or her role, responsibilities and duties with respect to the Funds (“Applicable Laws”). These requirements do not impose on Covered Officers any additional substantive duties. Additionally, Covered Officers should promote compliance with Applicable Laws.







	If a Covered Officer knows of any material violations of Applicable Laws or suspects that such a violation may have occurred, the Covered Officer is expected to promptly report the matter to the DeAWM Compliance Officer.






	 







	IV.  






	Violation Reporting











	 



	A.


	 


	Overview



	 



	Each Covered Officer must promptly report to the DeAWM Compliance Officer, and promote the reporting of, any known or suspected violations of the Officer Code.  Failure to report a violation may be a violation of the Officer Code.







	Examples of violations of the Officer Code include, but are not limited to, the following:








	·  






	Unethical or dishonest behavior












	·  






	Obvious lack of adherence to policies surrounding review and approval of public communications and regulatory filings












	·  






	Failure to report violations of the Officer Code












	·  






	Known or obvious deviations from Applicable Laws












	·  






	Failure to acknowledge and certify adherence to the Officer Code











	The DeAWM Compliance Officer has the authority to take any and all action he or she considers appropriate in his or her sole discretion to investigate known or suspected Code violations, including consulting with the Fund’s Board, the independent Board members, a Board committee, the Fund’s legal counsel and/or counsel to the independent Board members.  The Compliance Officer also has the authority to use all reasonable resources to investigate violations, including retaining or engaging legal counsel, accounting firms or other consultants, subject to applicable law.


	3


	The costs associated with such actions may be borne by the Fund, if appropriate, after consultation with the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof).  Otherwise, such costs will be borne by DeAWM.












	3

	For example, retaining a Fund’s independent accounting firm may require pre-approval by the Fund’s audit committee.



	 


	 




	B.


	 


	How to Report



	 



	Any known or suspected violations of the Officer Code must be promptly reported to the DeAWM Compliance Officer.



	 



	C.


	 


	Process for Violation Reporting to the Fund Board



	 



	The DeAWM Compliance Officer will promptly report any violations of the Code to the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof).



	 



	D.


	 


	Sanctions for Code Violations



	 



	Violations of the Code will be taken seriously.  In response to reported or otherwise known violations, DeAWM and the relevant Fund’s Board may impose sanctions within the scope of their respective authority over the Covered Officer at issue.  Sanctions imposed by DeAWM could include termination of employment.  Sanctions imposed by a Fund’s Board could include termination of association with the Fund.



	 





	 








	V.  






	Waivers from the Officer Code







	 



	A Covered Officer may request a waiver from the Officer Code by transmitting a written request for a waiver to the DeAWM Compliance Officer.


	4


	  The request must include the rationale for the request and must explain how the waiver would be in furtherance of the standards of conduct described in and underlying purposes of the Officer Code. The DeAWM Compliance Officer will present this information to the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof).  The Board (or committee) will determine whether to grant the requested waiver.  If the Board (or committee) grants the requested waiver, the DeAWM Compliance Officer thereafter will monitor the activities subject to the waiver, as appropriate, and will promptly report to the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof) regarding such activities, as appropriate.







	The DeAWM Compliance Officer will coordinate and facilitate any required public disclosures of any waivers granted or any implicit waivers.



	 


	 








	4

	Of course, it is not a waiver of the Officer Code if the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof) determines that a matter is not a deviation from the Officer Code’s requirements or is otherwise not covered by the Code.





	 







	VI.  






	Amendments to the Code







	 



	The DeAWM Compliance Officer will review the Officer Code from time to time for its continued appropriateness and will propose any amendments to the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof) on a timely basis.  In addition, the Board (or committee thereof) will review the Officer Code at least annually for its continued appropriateness and may amend the Code as necessary or appropriate.







	The DeAWM Compliance Officer will coordinate and facilitate any required public disclosures of Code amendments.






	 







	VII.  






	Acknowledgement and Certification of Adherence to the Officer Code








	 



	Each Covered Officer must sign a statement upon appointment as a Covered Officer and annually thereafter acknowledging that he or she has received and read the Officer Code, as amended or updated, and confirming that he or she has complied with it (see Appendix B: Acknowledgement and Certification of Obligations Under the Officer Code).







	Understanding and complying with the Officer Code and truthfully completing the Acknowledgement and Certification Form is each Covered Officer’s obligation.







	The DeAWM Compliance Officer will maintain such Acknowledgements in the Fund’s books and records.






	 







	VIII.  






	Scope of Responsibilities











	A Covered Officer’s responsibilities under the Officer Code are limited to:











	(1)  






	Fund matters over which the Officer has direct responsibility or control, matters in which the Officer routinely participates, and matters with which the Officer is otherwise involved (

	i.e.

	, matters within the scope of the Covered Officer’s responsibilities as a Fund officer); and












	(2)  






	Fund matters of which the Officer has actual knowledge.










	 







	IX.  






	Recordkeeping











	The DeAWM Compliance Officer will create and maintain appropriate records regarding the implementation and operation of the Officer Code, including records relating to conflicts of interest determinations and investigations of possible Code violations.






	 







	X.  






	Confidentiality











	All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Officer Code shall be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.  Except as otherwise required by law or this Officer Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the DeAWM Compliance Officer, the Fund’s Board (or committee thereof), legal counsel, independent auditors, and any consultants engaged by the Compliance Officer.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
