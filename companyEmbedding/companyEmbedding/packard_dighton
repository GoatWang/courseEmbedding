Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Packard has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for Texas.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Packard's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Packard's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices.

ShareConditions Commonly Seen in PatientsThe following information is provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the year 2014 and depicts the rates of sixteen chronic conditions found in Dr. Packard's Medicare patients. It should be noted that the prevalence of conditions listed below may not be characteristic of the provider's entire patient population, and in some cases information has been redacted from the original data source to protect patient information.Most Frequently SeenMoreMost Frequently SeenThroughout 2014, Dr. Packard saw the greatest relative rate of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (53% of Medicare patients) compared to averages for all physicians in his state, likely indicating he is experienced in managing treatment and complications associated with this condition.Overview of Chronic Kidney Disease:seriousnessModerateprevalenceVery Commonmonetary costHigh

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes the gradual loss of kidney function over a long period of time. Any condition that damages the kidney can cause CKD, but diabetes and high blood pressure account for most cases. Because the loss of function is gradual, most people do not develop symptoms until there is irreversible kidney damage. CKD is diagnosed using tests that measure levels of waste products in blood and urine. Diagnosis includes using a staging system to determine how far the disease has progressed. Because kidney damage is irreversible, treatment aims to slow the progression of the disease by controlling underlying causes and making adjustments in diet and lifestyle. Once the kidneys have failed, dialysis, transplant and supportive care are the remaining treatment options. Anemia, bone disease and edema are common complications of CKD, but the effects of kidney damage cause problems in all organ systems. Measures that can help prevent CKD include preventing and treating known causes. If you have CKD, seek support to cope with the physical demands and emotional stress of a challenging disease.

Full Description


Chronic kidney disease (CKD) describes the gradual loss of kidney function over a long period of time. Any disease or condition that affects the kidney and causes kidney damage can cause CKD. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes, but birth defects, infections, obstructions and medications can also cause CKD. Because the loss of function is gradual, most people do not develop symptoms until there is irreversible kidney damage. Nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and appetite loss appear early on, but as the disease progresses more severe symptoms appear, including itching, swelling, easy bruising and decreased mental sharpness. The kidneys remove wastes and fluid from the blood, so CKD is diagnosed by measuring the levels of waste products in blood and urine. The level of creatinine, a waste product, in the blood is an important marker. High creatinine levels reflect poor kidney function. Diagnosis includes determining how far along the disease has progressed using a staging system (stages 1-5) based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The GFR is a calculated number that reflects kidney function. Because kidney damage is irreversible, treatment aims to slow the progression of the disease to prevent or delay complications. Controlling underlying causes and making adjustments in diet and lifestyle are important pieces of the treatment puzzle. Once the kidneys have failed, dialysis, transplant and supportive care are the remaining treatment options. Anemia, bone disease and edema are the most common complications of CKD, but additional complications reflect the effects of kidney damage on other organ systems, including the nervous system (dementia, neuropathy), heart and blood vessels (pericarditis, congestive heart failure), reproductive system (infertility and miscarriage) and immune system (reduced immunity).Measures that can help prevent CKD include controlling existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure and diabetes) and making lifestyle changes to prevent developing conditions that harm the kidney. You can be an active participant in preventing or delaying complications by working with a dietitian to make changes to reduce your intake of salt, phosphorus, potassium, protein and fluids. If you are living with CKD, seek support to help you face the challenging physical and emotional demands.
