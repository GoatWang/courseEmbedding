Howard Herman Newman's Experience
Title: Senior Vice President, Engineering Central Florida
               Company: The Corradino Group Inc
Job Details
               The Corradino Group, Inc. (Corradino) is firmly committed to treating employees and applicants for employment without discrimination because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, membership in a protected age group, disability (if otherwise qualified for the job), genetic information, or any other legally protected classification and according to their experience, talent, and qualifications for the job. Our policy in this regard covers all employment decisions, including recruitment, hiring, placement, promotions, transfers, layoffs or terminations, rates of pay, employee benefits, and selection for training. Any person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having such impairment may request an accommodation. It is the practice of Corradino to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal and full access to the facilities and activities of our organization. Access includes not only going into and moving about buildings and using accessible restrooms, but also fully participating in Corradino's programs, services, and activities. To provide both types of access, Corradino takes responsibility for providing reasonable accommodations to the public. Accommodations can be provided in a variety of ways. Because people and disabilities are unique, Corradino and persons with disabilities must interactively discuss each person's needs and the types of accommodations that the organization can provide. Consistent with the prevailing law, Corradino will accommodate language-impaired person's access to information and services through translation and other services. These services are available to employees as well as the general public who have limited ability to read, write, speak, or understand English. To make language or other access requests please use the contact us form. Corradino was founded in Louisville, KY, in 1970. It quickly established a national reputation on major transportation projects, such as the Miami-Dade Metro Rail beginning in the mid-70s. In 1984, the firm's first acquisition was of the well-established practice in Miami of Carr Smith Associates.  Then, new start-up companies specializing in environmental management and communications were created. Four different companies parented by Corradino merged in 1997; followed by the start-up of Corradino Design/Build.  The Corradino Group is a team of professional engineers, planners, architects, and constructors who help clients across the United States translate their ideas - dreams - into reality.

Howard Newman Weds Dr. Razavi
Published: July 18, 1988









                    Dr. Maryam Razavi and Howard H. Newman were married yesterday at the bride's home in Manhattan. Rabbi David B. Kudan officiated.        

                    The bride, the daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Seid Ahmad Razavi of Teheran, Iran, is a psychotherapist. She graduated from San Francisco State University and received a doctorate in social work from Columbia University. Her father, a founder of the National Front Party, served as speaker of the Iranian Parliament in the Government of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh from 1951 to 1953.        

                    Mr. Newman, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Nat Newman of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is a partner in the investment firm of E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company in New York. A graduate of Yale University, he received a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University. His father retired as president of Jacks of York Inc., a women's clothing store in York, Pa.        

                    The bridegroom is a great-grandson of the late Bernard Horwich, a founder of the Federation of Jewish Charities of Chicago and the Jewish Community Centers of Chicago. He was also president of the General Felt Products Company.
