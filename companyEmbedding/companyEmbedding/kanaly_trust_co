Approach
It’s personal: uncommon care, applied expertise, earned trust.
We are singularly committed to earning your trust through personal attention, purity of perspective, and protection-first performance from proven experts and dedicated teams.
Our entire business is based on personal relationships with individuals and families. We’re in it together – sitting on the same side of the table to understand needs, protect hard-earned wealth and create the peace of mind to live happy and fulfilling lives. To us, it’s personal!
That is why we make it our business to earn trust through uncommon care and applied expertise. While many firms use technology to create automated “accounts” and cross-sell features, Kanaly Trust is unwavering in mindset and behavior to go above and beyond to provide a high-touch, transparent and fully accessible “home” for clients who put their trust in us.

Pure perspective and objectivity as an independent, client-first partner
Serving families throughout the arc of their lives
Access to a dedicated, experienced Kanaly Trust team of experts
Well-researched and hand-selected investment managers
Investment acumen + institutional insights + individual know-how

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. and HOUSTON, March 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mercer Advisors and Kanaly Trust, two leading wealth management firms, today announced that they have reached a definitive agreement to merge.  Upon the merger completion, the combined company will manage assets exceeding $8 billion making it one of the largest independent wealth managers in the United States.  Terms of the private transaction were not disclosed.








The combined company will be led by David H. Barton, Chief Executive Officer of Mercer Advisors.  Mercer Advisors was acquired by Genstar Capital, a private equity firm, last year.  Kanaly Trust is owned by Lovell Minnick Partners, a private equity firm that invests in the financial and related business services sectors, which will retain a stake in the combined company.
Mercer Advisors is a total wealth management firm that provides fee-only comprehensive investment management, financial planning, family office services, retirement benefits and distribution planning, estate planning, and tax management services.  Based in Santa Barbara, Mercer has over $6 billion in assets under management and more than 5,000 clients.  Kanaly Trust provides comprehensive wealth management and financial planning and trust/estate services to families, individuals, and estates.  The Houston-based company manages and advises on assets totaling over $2 billion on behalf of more than 500 families, and serves as the trustee or executor for estates totaling more than $2.5 billion.   
"This transaction brings together two great companies and creates a strong partnership of people who have the benefit of a stronger platform from which to offer expanded services with the personal and customized service clients demand," said Barton.  "Genstar has been instrumental in helping us rapidly grow our company, and we are well-positioned to build on our momentum.  Paramount in Kanaly Trust's decision to join Mercer Advisors was our shared commitment to the highest level of service, which makes this combination such a great fit."
"The merger with Kanaly Trust is a significant step forward towards scaling a national wealth management firm to a broader base of sophisticated clients," said Anthony J. Salewski, a Managing Director at Genstar.  "This transaction combines the complementary resources of two important players, and we are excited about this transformative partnership.  We are pleased with Mercer Advisors' progress, led by Dave, and we plan to continue to invest in and support the company as it continues to build its presence in the wealth management sector."
"This merger brings together two world-class wealth management firms, which will allow us to expand client resources beyond the high-levels we have today," noted Drew Kanaly, Chairman of Kanaly Trust.  "Our extensive experience working with high-net-worth entrepreneurs and executives, and family offices is highly complementary to Mercer Advisors, and this partnership will allow us to provide those services on a national level."
"The talented Kanaly Trust team remains focused on providing high touch, highly personalized financial advice and customized solutions, which we believe will continue to be in high demand among clients," said James E. Minnick, Co-Chairman of Lovell Minnick Partners.  "We look forward to our continued involvement and support in working with Mercer and Kanaly in growing the combined company."
Moelis & Company LLC served as financial advisor, and Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP acted as legal counsel, to Kanaly Trust.  Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP served as legal counsel to Mercer Advisors.
The merger is subject to customary regulatory approval.

What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!
